15,Joseph Phelps Freestone Vineyards Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,70,14.1,4.3,218,"The 2019 Pinot Noir Freestone Vineyards takes time to open, metamorphosing from iron and woodsmoke to raspberries, dried flowers, dark spices and aniseed.

17,Moet & Chandon Imperial,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,62,12,4.5,435,"When it comes to finesse, this classic—roughly equal parts Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier with a slightly smaller amount of Chardonnay—doesn’t miss: It’s comme il faut from the unending bead onward. Joined by biscuit and almond aromas, ripe golden apple on the nose turns to green on the palate, where citrus—lime, grapefruit, mandarin orange—cycles through high-flying acidity even as luscious pear adds weight and chalk conveys elegance through the finish.  An elegant version, fine and creamy in texture and backed by lively, orange peel acidity.

Toasty biscuit, plush apricot and a hint of zesty lemon peel, the palate is braced with bright lime and soft spice. The lower dosage of this famous brand has produced good balance between the crisply textured white fruits and the light minerality. The Champagne just hints of some bottle age. It is totally ready to drink. This Brut NV is all about textural feel, in a comparable way to velvet and leather apparel. It takes a moment’s aeration in the glass for the discreet citrus, apple-ring and toasty character to emerge, so don’t rush this. The simultaneously mellow and lively balance and the harmoniously dry finish will appeal to a wide public. Drink now. "

Medium to full-bodied, layered and textural, with a fleshy core of fruit, terrific concentration and a racy spine of acidity, it's a deep, comparatively structured wine that will evolve beautifully in the cellar. As I've written before, this iteration is a blend of the 2008, 2007 and 2006 vintages, with 2008 lending #25 its depth and structure, 2007 contributing additional cut and 2006 additional richness. While the #25 exemplifies the seamless charm of this bottling, it's also one of the best propositions for long-term cellaring among recent renditions of Grand Siècle, and it will really reward time on cork. COMMENTARY: The Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle Iteration No. 25 deftly combines richness with finesse. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of tart apples, mineral notes, and a slight creaminess. Enjoy it with steamed Dungeness crab in a delicate white wine reduction sauce.

The result at this stage exhibits its Chardonnay character, with toasty notes of ripe pear and spice on the nose and a creamy, silky texture and an edge of citrus. Although elegant and refined at present, the underlying power will doubtless come to the fore with time. Dosage: 7g/L. Reveals rich and concentrated flavors of pear tart and dried mango, roasted hazelnut and ground coffee, preserved lemon and candied ginger enlivened by a spine of racy acidity and an underlying streak of minerally smoke and brine.

The medium-bodied palate is packed with pure, zesty, expressive tropical and citrus layers plus tons of minerally accents and herbal sparks lifting the finish.

It has great concentration and complexity, with a lovely grip of acidity on the finish. The NV Champagne Reserve Brut is sunny with aromas of golden orchard fruits, pineapple, yellow apple, and fresh pastry dough. The palate is matched with ripe peach, buttered orange citrus, and yellow flowers and is rounded, with a silky mouthfeel, although it is fully dry. Classic in style, it is charming and leans towards opulence. Best after 2022. Firm acidity defines this rich, well-integrated Champagne, with aromas and flavors of toasted brioche and grilled nut, white peach and cherry fruit, coffee liqueur and grated ginger.

Old-vine magic. Drink after 2026. The ‘dream’ in Italian, this is from very old, high-altitude vineyards on stony soils mixed with sand and stone. This is one of the wines of the tasting, a real showstopper that captures your interest and holds it all the way. Red cherries and strawberries dominate the nose with softly-spiced liquorice touches. But it’s the texture that’s so captivating, gripping straight away and holding you there, but in a soft and gentle way. Bright acidity comes in keeping things fresh and welcoming while the structure and length give a lovely roundness. A real success. Grapes for Colore are sourced from three vineyards, with each harvested up to eight times. After the first selection in the vineyards, a second selection occurs at the winery before destemming where grapes are softly pressed and placed in open-top barriques, keeping each plot and parcel separate from the others. The fermentation is conducted naturally by indigenous yeasts without temperature control lasting up to two weeks, with one extra week of maceration on the skins. After the fermentation the wine is moved into new barriques, where the malolactic fermentation happens. Each parcel is aged separately for almost 20 months before the final blend is decided. Dressed for a party, the Bibi Graetz 2019 Colore celebrates the estate's 20th anniversary with a special commemorative (2000-2019) bottle. This vintage of Colore is 100% Sangiovese (the small part of Colorino in the blend we saw last year has been removed) because Bibi thought the Sangiovese elegant enough to stand alone. Fruit comes from three vineyard sites with 70-, 80- and 90-year-old vines, respectively. The wine offers big intensity and beautifully lifted aromas and more textural support than we saw in the slightly thinner 2018 vintage. The bouquet reveals balsam herb, cassis, pressed rose, garden mint and crushed stone. Fruit from the southern-most site, Poggio Matto in Casciano del Murlo (in the province of Siena), was blended in at a greater percentage to help build the structure and momentum of this cellar-worthy wine.

The flavors of tobacco, cinnamon, pomegranate pith, and sandalwood form a charming parade. This is a juicy red, with unearthed raspberries and a spiced cedar finish. This moody, dusky, flavorful wine offers rich black tea, forest duff and black-cherry notes on a full body framed by light tannins. Complexity without noticeable oak, length and a supple mouthfeel make it especially enjoyable. An attractive nose of red cherry, sliced strawberry and hibiscus. Medium-bodied with gentle tannins. The palate has more wet mineral and wild berry notes than the nose lets on, giving it more width and depth through the juicy finish.

Medium-to full-bodied with velvety tannins and bright acidity. Lovely, clear red and black-fruit flavor with a background note of peppermint. Readers looking for a classic Pinot Noir that won’t break the bank yet brings loads of pleasure should latch onto a few bottles of the 2019 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast. Revealing a translucent medium ruby color as well as textbook Pinot Noir notes of ripe cherry and mulberry fruits interwoven with sappy herbs, sous bois, and scorched earth, it hits the palate with medium-bodied richness and plenty of mid-palate depth as well as a racy, vibrant spine of acidity. It’s a value-priced Pinot Noir, but I think it will benefit from another 6-12 months of bottle age, and I have no doubt it will keep for another 5-7 years. It’s incredibly well done. Exuberantly juicy, with concentrated raspberry and red plum flavors that are supported by fresh acidity. The sleek finish has minerally and flinty components that are focused and fresh-tasting.

It’s the first Pahlmeyer wine to include fruit from the Upper Range Vineyard, a new planting above the Silverado Trail east toward Pritchard Hill. This 2018 is a lovely, rosy cabernet, the fruit following along with the tannins in a harmony of woodland scents, forest blueberry, tight cranberry and a light, fruity mushroom dimension.

Hints of chocolate and almonds. Really polished. Very drinkable now, but will age beautifully. There are roughly 25,000 cases of the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley, which is sourced from all over the valley.

55,Bodegas Muga Prado Enea Gran Reserva,2015,Tempranillo,Spain,99,14.5,4.0,6,"Reserved and polished, this is a Prado Enea with great class and focus. It’s so aromatic,with plum, peach, cherry and cedar character. Salted olives, too. Medium-to full-bodied with very fine tannins and a long, fresh finish. Elegance with power here. Give it three or four years to open, but already impressive. The most classical of their wines, the 2015 Prado Enea Gran Reserva is a blend of Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo and Graciano, mostly from Rioja Alta (Sajazarra, Cellorigo and Fonzaleche), but the Garnacha is from different plots in the zone of Tudelilla at high altitude. These grapes are always picked last, but the wine has a similar alcohol level as the rest, around 14.5% in a warm year like 2019. The modus operandi is similar to other of the top cuvées—harvested into 200-kilogram boxes, destemming, optical sorting and fermentation in small oak casks with indigenous yeasts. The élevage in this case is extended to 36 months, and the barrels are only 10% new. This is, year in, year out, my favorite wine from Muga, and in this powerful and ripe year, these late-harvesting vines ripened thoroughly and delivered a full array of aromas and flavors so that the wine has plenty of depth and complexity. It has a very classical profile, with incipient tertiary notes, perfumed, floral and rich, textured and beautifully balanced. They compare this 2015 with 2009 and 2005 in terms of style but with freshness in the style of 2001 and 2010. It's enjoyable but should also develop for a long time in bottle. One of the finest Prado Enea vintages. The 2015 Prado Enea Gran Reserva comes from a hotter, riper vintage, but it shares similar gamey, exotic aromatics of red and black fruits, sappy herbs, flowers, leather, iron, and background cedary oak. Rich, medium to full-bodied, incredibly pure, and balanced, it has ripe, still present tannins, impeccable balance, and a great finish. This is a classic expression of this cuvée that can be enjoyed any time over the coming two decades or more. Well-tailored in an understated way, this harmonious red is plushly creamy on the palate, like fine cashmere, showing seamless integration of the sculpted tannins with finely detailed flavors of black cherry and black plum reduction, sandalwood, cedar, green olive, espresso crema and minerally smoke and iron. Long and lightly juicy on the refined finish. Tempranillo, Graciano, Mazuelo and Garnacha. "

A tasting of several foudres point to a wine with natural, easy balance. The Mourvèdre is excellent here this year, and adds great depth to the fresh and delightful Grenache that has notes of black tea, black cherry and iron. Elegant and very fine. Beguiling, with a plume of black tea and incense leading off, followed by warmed black cherry reduction, cassis, melted black licorice, warm earth and singed tobacco and garrigue accents. Offers breadth and depth with a seamless feel, capped by a subtle mineral edge that lingers lengthily amid the beautiful fruit. Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre.  "

Deep ruby/purple, with stunning crème de cassis and blackberry fruits as well as kaleidoscope-like notes of graphite, scorched earth, smoke, violets, and spring flowers, it offers full-bodied richness yet stays light on its feet, graceful, and almost ethereal on the palate, with integrated acidity and building yet seamless tannin's. The Cabernet Sauvignon really sings at this point, and there's almost a Médoc-like regalness here. Reminding me of a slightly more elegant 2005 (it also has similarities to the 2016), it will benefit from 4-6 years in the cellar and keep for 30+ years. Aromas of wild blackberries, blueberries, dried lavender, cloves and eucalyptus with gravel and cocoa butter. It’s full-bodied with firm, powdery tannins. Polished and creamy with a core of ripe fruit that evolves to herbs, spices and chocolate. Fantastic concentration and seamless integration. Try from 2024. A warm mocha note drapes elegantly over a prodigious core of steeped red and black currant and blackberry fruit while waves of black tea, anise, fruitcake and applewood fill in on the finish. Structure is serious and well-imbedded. Really well put together. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2025 through 2038. I love watching how Pape Clement is evolving with every vintage. There's still a bit of Venice Beach in its muscles but it has let some juice in between the firm tannins and it's all the better for it. There are ripples of freshness here too, with lots of fleshy fruit, and a slatey mineral finish that sits against chocolate and smoked cedar notes. It's clearly been carefully extracted yet still has the serious ageing ability and sense of confidence that is the signature of the property. 37hl/ha yield in 2018. Two-thirds new oak. Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2018 Clémentin de Pape Clement strides confidently out of the glass with classic scents of ripe blackcurrants, juicy black plums and cedar chest, plus touches of graphite, bay leaves, unsmoked cigars and espresso. The medium-bodied, elegantly styled palate (13.5% alcohol) has a lot of grace and presence for a second wine, featuring finely grained tannins and seamless freshness to support the bright, black fruit flavors, finishing on a minerally note. "
60,Col d'Orcia Brunello di Montalcino,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,55,14.5,4.3,20,"The 2016 Col d’Orcia Brunello offers notes of pine resin, black cherry, and dried strawberry aromatics. The palate is concentrated and compact, with dried tomato leaf bitterness and tobacco. The structure is not shy, with a rich core of fruit, bold tannin upfront and just as much acidity to match. This is a bold wine for the 2016 vintage, packed with sun-kissed warmth. It commands time in the cellar, so drinking is recommended over 2026-2041. Underbrush, wild-berry, pipe-tobacco and violet aromas lead the nose. On the full-bodied palate, taut tannins support black cherry, licorice and ground clove. Drink 2024–2031. A very polished, refined red with berry and flower aromas, as well as hints of citrus and rose petals. Medium to full body, fine tannins and a juicy finish. Lovely polish. From organically grown grapes. Give it a year or two to come around, but already very pretty. "

All the major houses make wonderful aged tawnies and this is always one of the best. Ethereal and mellow on the palate, it boasts flavours of toffee and caramel, burnt orange and raisins, dried plums, hazelnuts and a savoury hint of mushroom on the finish. Wonderful stuff! Dried cherry, iodine and peat with some watermelon. Hints of toffee and bark. Medium-to full-bodied, sweet and layered with a tannin texture and rich finish. Tangy and focused. Drink now. Earthy rather than fruity, this is all about umami, its cool cellar tones layering dark mushroom and savory black bean flavors over papaya. It lasts with intriguing complexity that would work with a range of umami-rich foods, like seafood in an XO sauce. Lovely, with date and persimmon notes that are melded seamlessly, picking up light bitter orange, ginger and green tea accents along the way. Echoes of sweet golden raisin and hazelnut linger on the finish, which is polished and long. A beauty. Drink now. This is a hugely dry, burnt style, very concentrated. The licorice and bitter coffee flavors are dense, layered and well balanced with the acidity. A serious wine that demands attention. "

It's medium to full-bodied, supple, silky and elegant yet still possesses enough richness to evolve for the next two decades. From the stunning, slightly lifted aromas of violets, cherries and cassis, to the long, dusty finish, this exudes class all the way. Best After 2024 Delivers a lot to like, with a violet thread amid a mix of cassis, plum reduction and blackberry puree flavors, all stitched with light alder, singed vanilla and tobacco notes.

An impeccably balanced and graceful sparkling rosé, with a plushly creamy mousse. It’s hard to tell where the firm
spine of well-honed acidity and the expressive range of pureed raspberry, candied ginger, tangerine and lemon
thyme flavors begin or end. A rich hint of smoky toasted brioche plays on the finish. Drink now through 2033.— Offering up aromas of white flowers, red berries, toast and fresh pastry, Dom Pérignon rosé 2008 is medium to full-bodied, tense and vibrant, with a vinous texture and sapid nuances.

The tannins are dense but velvety, and this finishes with warm chocolaty notes. Sourced from vineyards in McLaren Vale, Barossa Valley, Padthaway and Clare Valley. Matured for 12 months in American hogsheads (16% new). Penfolds' team of winemakers have come up with an improbably fluid wine that has entirely unexpected elements of grace. All the components of fruit, oak, tannins and acidity – the last particularly important – are in synergistic union. A homage to warmer-region, South Australian shiraz, this has a rich and smooth delivery of ripe blackberries and red-to-dark plums on the nose. The wine has taken its 12 months in American oak (16% new) well and truly in its stride. Plush and suave mouth-feel here, this is effortless and a style that sits right in the Penfolds sweet spot.

A model of consistency over 32 vintages, Shaw + Smith Sauvignon Blanc continues to lead the way in 2021 with a combination of fruit intensity and a seeming lightness of being. It's told in 2 parts; the 1st is exuberant tropicals, citrus and herbal interplay, but it quickly moves into a state of serious intensity, filigree acidity and mealy texture. That lasting impression saturates the tastebuds and stays with you. A very strong vintage for this popular Adelaide Hills sauvignon, it sits in a deliciously ripe yet fresh zone and is bathed in peach, nectarine, green-mango and passion-fruit aromas and flavors.

Lots of flavors of lemon rind, salt, mineral and honeysuckle with an attractive fresh-herb undertone. Then it turns to candied lemons with some ginger. A triumph in complexity and power. A blend of 2008, 2007 and 2006. 60% chardonnay and 40% pinot noir. 7g/L dosage. Drink or hold. The NV Champagne Grand Siecle Grand Cuvée No. 25 is composed of the 2008, 2007, and 2006 vintages, from nine Grand Crus, and has 7 grams per liter dosage. It is only the second time in Laurent-Perrier’s history that this the cuvée was produced from consecutive vintages. This is the first and most complete of the three expressions I tasted in Tours-sur-Marne in September, as it strikes remarkable balance between richness and tension. The nose is elegant in its ripeness, with perfumed layers of white flowers, honey, and sweet pastry. Meanwhile, the palate is compact, racy, and focused. It all comes together with great length and a long finish. Best after 2024. COMMENTARY: The Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle Iteration No. 25 deftly combines richness with finesse. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of tart apples, mineral notes, and a slight creaminess. Enjoy it with steamed Dungeness crab in a delicate white wine reduction sauce. (Tasted; March 1, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The newest release of Grand Siècle is based upon the superb and structured 2008 vintage (65% of the blend), along with the vivacious 2007 vintage (25%), and the creamy, luxurious 2006 (10%). The final blend is 60% Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs and 40% Pinot Noir from the Montagne de Reims. The result at this stage exhibits its Chardonnay character, with toasty notes of ripe pear and spice on the nose and a creamy, silky texture and an edge of citrus. Although elegant and refined at present, the underlying power will doubtless come to the fore with time. Dosage: 7g/L. Reveals rich and concentrated flavors of pear tart and dried mango, roasted hazelnut and ground coffee, preserved lemon and candied ginger enlivened by a spine of racy acidity and an underlying streak of minerally smoke and brine. Offers a fine and creamy mousse, with pleasing viscosity to the overall impression.  "
77,DAOU Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon,2021,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,30,14.5,4.2,71,"The nose on this wine is herbal with anise, oregano and pencil-shaving aromas, while blackberry and cocoa provide depth. Fennel pollen and roasted nut flavors meet with rich berry on the palate, where tannins are light but present. COMMENTARY: The 2021 DAOU Discovery Collection Cabernet Sauvignon is pleasing, well-balanced, and lovely to enjoy now. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits aromas and flavors of loganberries and savory spices. Enjoy its soft touch in the finish with grilled cheeseburgers.

78,La Rioja Alta Vina Alberdi Reserva Tinto,2018,Tempranillo,Spain,23,14.5,4.0,67,"A pretty nose of raspberries, cassis, fresh herbs, vanilla and sweet spices. It’s medium-bodied with round tannins. Creamy and fruity with chocolatey character on the mid-palate. Supple finish with excellent length. Tangy acidity. 100% tempranillo. Drink or hold. Their young and fresh red 2018 Viña Alberdi, already a Reserva (Crianza in Spain), matured in oak barrel for two years—in new barrels for the first year and in used barrels for the second year. During the élevage, they racked the wine manually from barrel to barrel four times. 2018 was a year of lower alcohol and more freshness in the wines, and they thought the wines were not designed for the long haul; so, they didn't produce any other wine, and so the only wine from 2018 IS VIÑA ALBERDI! Which means that all the Tempranillo grapes that were destined for 890, 904 and all the other wines went to this wine. They didn't use the Garnacha (which was sold in bulk). So, this is a super- Viña Alberdi, which shows more Crianza style in this cooler vintage but with very good depth and complexity, perhaps a more modern and fresher style. The wine has a seamless palate and a juicy texture, with more color than other vintages, more intensity, more fruit... It has grapes from very good vineyards and poor soils that were never destined for this wine. Highly recommendable and very versatile. It has potential to age. They produced a whopping one million bottles of it. It was bottled in March 2021. "
79,Chateau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande,2009,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,244,13,4.6,13,"A beautifully ripe, intense and concentrated red and black fruit aroma leads to a palate that's still closed, but those damson fruits are well brushed and of serious quality. This is going beat for beat with the top level wines in 2009 and it's utterly brilliant, delivering juice, minerality, power, balance, silky tannins, definition and sheer enjoyment. What a great nose of blackberries, currants and spices. Hints of fresh herbs. Full body, with ultra-fine tannins and lovely fruit. Such finesse and beauty. Wonderful to taste. Reminds me of the legendary 1982. Try in 2018. Offers a dark roasted core of plum sauce, warm fig paste, melted licorice and singed cedar, while a mouthwatering iron edge and a lovely smoldering tobacco note add lift and length through the finish. A touch restrained now, but should blossom with cellaring. Best from 2017 through 2033. "

81,La Rioja Alta Vina Arana Rioja Gran Reserva,2014,Tempranillo,Spain,43,13.5,4.0,114,"Arana commemorates one of La Rioja Alta's historic families. The Tempranillo (95%) and Graciano (5%) are aged separately in American oak barrels for three years before blending, then for three years in bottle (two years less than the 904, and six years less than the 890). The winery's keynote to this Rioja is 'freshness'. I agree. The aim with the 2014 Viña Arana Gran Reserva is to find a new Gran Reserva style that combines freshness and joy with intensity, sophistication and aging potential through a blend of Tempranillo with 6% Graciano that matured in American oak barrels for three years with rackings every six months. 2014 was a weaker year in the region, and the wine shows it and feels less vivacious than the 2015 Viña Alberdi. It has medium ripeness and abundant spicy and smoky notes and a medium-bodied palate with a soft texture that points at a wine for shorter-term consumption than the rest of the portfolio or other vintages from this cuvée.

Gains a savory element, thanks to a touch of toasted sesame seed. Drink now. "
84,Duckhorn Three Palms Merlot,2019,Merlot,California,119,14.5,0.0,0,"I like the savory nose here, with notes of coffee, spiced plum, overturned earth and bark. Full-bodied with fine, silky tannins. Expressive, but focused, with really clean and clear dark fruit blending nicely with ground spice and grilled herbs. Totally delicious. This will age very nicely.  6% Cabernet Sauvignon; 1% Malbec; 1% Cabernet Franc. Yet again finding a familiar place at the head of the Duckhorn class of 2019, this year’s Three Palms Vineyard Merlot is a beautifully crafted wine of tremendous richness and depth. Although an intense and wonderfully expressive effort now whose polished, age-worthy tannins are countered by a wealth of extremely longlasting fruit, it has the all of the pieces in place to evolve famously and, when carefully cellared, is guaranteed to pay big dividends upon reaching its tenth anniversary. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Duckhorn Three Palms Vineyard Merlot is powerful yet elegant, and it stays long on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of black fruit, licorice, earth, and oak. Enjoy with roast game birds. (Tasted: May 1, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "
85,Louis Roederer Brut Rose,2015,Sparkling Rosé,France,85,11,0.0,0,"The 2015 Brut Vintage Rosé is generous and demonstrative, bursting with aromas of peach, orange and pear mingled with hints of red berries, fresh bread and ginger. Full-bodied, layered and vinous, it's rich and enveloping, its textural attack segueing into an ample, fleshy core that's girdled by bright acids and enlivened by a pillowy mousse. Long and expansive, it's more generous and gourmand than its racier 2014 predecessor, but just as good. This shows lots of cotton candy and peach, together with strawberries and cream. But not overpowering. Some cranberry, too. It’s medium-to full-bodied with fine bubbles and a lively finish. Dosage 8g/L. Drink now or hold. COMMENTARY: The 2015 Champagne Louis Roederer Champagne Rosé shows excellent style and complexity, with a nice bite in the aftertaste. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of fragrant strawberries, a touch of yeastiness, and a faint chalky note. Pair it with grilled, wild-caught salmon. (Tasted: August 2, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Pure and pretty notes of wild strawberry and nectarine fruit are enriched by hints of marzipan, chalk and pickled ginger in this graceful rosé Champagne. Lithe and expressive, with a fine, lively mousse, this shows lovely balance and a creamy, mineral-laced finish. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. A short maceration with the grape skins adds color and vinous depths of flavor to this earthy wine. It opens to brisk and bold red-fruit flavors that one taster compared to a tibouren rosé from Bandol. Cellar this to bring up its complexities. "
86,Cliff Lede Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,79,14.9,4.3,24,"Blended with 13% Merlot and smaller amounts of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, this is a focused and youthfully grippy wine, showing a fervor of succulent red- and black-currant and licorice. Thick, rich and intensely structured, it possesses a mineral-like earthiness of crushed rock and enduring structure. Composed of 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot, 6% Petit Verdot, 3% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc, the deep garnet-purple colored 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Stags Leap District charges out of the gate with exuberant scents of boysenberries, blackcurrant cordial and warm black plums plus touches of bay leaves, damp soil, pencil shavings and sandalwood. The medium to full-bodied palate is bold, expressive and open for business with bags of juicy black fruit flavors and a velvety texture, finishing with an earthy kick and a burst of freshness. "

88,Chateau Haut-Brion,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,809,14,4.2,20,"Stunning black fruit with plenty of forest berries in there, the whole picture cool and very delicate, also on the concentrated and highly structured palate. The tannins are very fine-grained, but decisively austere and, together with the vibrant acidity, they propel the finish out towards infinity and leave a breathtaking final impression. A blend of 56 per cent merlot, 37.5 per cent cabernet sauvignon and 6.5 per cent cabernet franc. Very long aging potential, but you could try it in 2023. The 2016 Haut-Brion is blended of 56% Merlot, 37.5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6.5% Cabernet Franc. Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the nose is at once profound and arresting, offering drop-dead gorgeous Morello cherries, lilacs and red rose scents with a core of Black Forest cake, warm blackcurrants and blueberry preserves plus wafts of sandalwood and underbrush. Medium-bodied, the elegantly crafted palate is completely packed with intense floral, mineral and cassis-laced flavors with a firm frame of very finely pixelated tannins and seamless freshness, finishing very long and achingly stunning. This has a little more reticence initially on the nose than La Mission, but after a few minutes the rich texture begins to reveal itself, with charcoal, tobacco, dark plum and damson fruits that are straining at the leash. It has hidden power and subtle oak toasting - this clearly feels no need to shout about its presence, but there will be plenty to discover over time. You can feel those tannins licking around your teeth, building up one layer at a time. A great wine En primeur that has settled into greatness. Large and in charge, this has a prodigious core of steeped plum, black currant and loganberry fruit flavors that show
both compote and coulis aspects. While that steeps, this delivers a sturdy frame of roasted mesquite, smoldering
tobacco and incense, surrounding a muscular spine of worn cedar and tar. Still rather backward, this will be showing
well when most others from the vintage have had their day. Best from 2025 through 2045. "
89,Domaine du Pegau Chateauneuf-du-Pape Cuvee Reservee,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,89,14.5,0.0,0,"This youthful Chateauneuf has a very complex nose of graphite, raw meat and lilies. With aeration the black-cherry note steadily grows in intensity. Bold, leathery and earthy palate with fine tannins that build steadily on at the extremely long and straight mineral finish. Drinkable now, but best from 2024. Dark and brooding, this has serious heft, with tightly coiled plum reduction and black licorice offset by savory tea, menthol, smoked meat and iodine. A great example of an old-school style, with mineral intensity building and salty iron and grippy tannins carrying the finish. Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. Best from 2024. "
90,Eden Rift Estate Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,47,13.8,4.5,31,"A layered and fine-grained pinot with strawberry and cherry aromas and flavors. Flint and some cranberry and watermelon, too. Pure. Medium to full body, bright acidity and light asphalt to the strawberry and raspberry undertones. Drink or hold. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Eden Rift Vineyards Estate Pinot Noir is well-built and lasting on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of rustic earth, savory spices, black fruit, and black tea. Try it with garlic and rosemary-infused roast leg of lamb. (Tasted: June 17, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The 2018 Pinot Noir Estate is another outstanding wine. Notes of Bing cherries, mulberries, loamy earth, and forest floor all emerge from the glass, and it's medium-bodied, has a rounded, balanced mouthfeel, nicely integrated acidity, and enough structure to keep it drinking well for at least 7-8 years. It's rock solid. Clean lines of plump black raspberry, pastry crust and tarragon make for a delicious nose on this estate bottling. Snappy raspberry flavors kick off the sip, where lilac, wild mint and dried herbs prove both fresh and delicate. Made from Dijon clone vines, the 2018 Pinot Noir Estate has a pale ruby-purple color and scents of spiced rhubarb and black cherries with notes of fragrant earth and tangerine peel. The palate is light-bodied, silky, bright and juicy with spice-laced fruits and a layered finish. Vinous and red fruited, of the six 2018s from Eden Rift, this may be the most structured, showing a rosy scent at a distance, and dried cherry and strawberry flavors. There’s much in place but it needs time. "

I have tasted nearly every vintage since I first tasted the 1972 vintage in the mid-1970s. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of alluring boysenberries, formidable blackberries, and racy minerality. (Tasted: March 27, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Deeply structured and briary, with a mix of red and black fruit accented by licorice, dill and savory underbrush flavors.

93,Domaine du Vieux Telegraphe Chateauneuf-du-Pape Telegramme,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,59,14.5,4.5,14,"Very ripe damson plum, but not a jot overripe on the finely nuanced nose. This powerful Chateauneuf has an excellent balance of generous, fine tannins and richness, the lively acidity lifting the long savory finish beautifully. Drink or hold. Deep violet. Ripe, spice-accented dark berry and cherry preserve scents show strong garrigue and floral accents. Pliant in texture and broad in the mouth, offering sappy boysenberry, bitter cherry and floral pastille flavors and a peppery topnote. Finishes long and gently chewy, with the floral and spice notes repeating. Bottled early in May, the 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape Télégramme offers a big, up-front, impressive style with classic red and blue fruits as well as licorice, peppery herbs, and crushed stone-like minerality. It has medium to full body, ripe, polished tannins, and a terrific level of class and elegance. Full-bodied, rich and highly textural, the 2019 Chateauneuf du Pape Telegramme is atypically concentrated and dense, reflecting the addition of more old-vine Grenache to the cuvée. Black cherries, salted licorice and dark chocolate all make appearances, and the wine finishes long and velvety. "

The palate has sleekly defined tannins, carrying intense, ripe blueberry and red-cherry flavors, amid deeply buried spice. Impressive, this is the finest Aroha to date. Drink or hold. This is not a timid wine. It's rich and round, wearing its brambly, medicinal, earthy, spicy and floral colors loud and proud. The silky mouthfeel is tugged into place by sappy tannins.

96,Beaux Freres Belles Soeurs Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Oregon,99,12.8,0.0,0,"Medium ruby-purple, the 2019 Pinot Noir The Belles Soeurs has alluring wild red and black berry fruits with wafts of garrigue, Earl Grey tea leaves and Angostura bitters. The palate is silky and intense with layered, graphite-tinged fruit and a very long finish that's notable for its purity and persistent perfume. The 2019 Pinot Noir The Belles Soeurs is elegant with the perfume of raspberry, cherry pie, dried roses, and cinnamon. The palate is vibrant and tension-driven with rose hip, hibiscus, and orange zest. I love this for its focused and direct nature, which will warrant some time in cellar to unfold. A wine that uncoils patiently, with cherry and blueberry flavors laced with dusky spice, gathering speed and tension toward stony yet polished tannins. Drink now through 2030. Aromas of dark cherry, plum, violet, smoke and cigar box. Medium-bodied with finely grained tannins and bright acidity. Balanced and refined. Harmonious, savory and silky with a succulent, long finish. A little tight now. Unfiltered. Try after 2023. From its origin as a Shea Vineyard bottling, Belle Soeur has transitioned to a blend fruit from the Beaux Freres, Upper Terrace, and Sequitur, all farmed by Mike Etzel. Today the grapes are picked earlier, and the extraction managed more gently to give a classic red fruit nose with spice on the attack and plenty of freshness and grippy tannins on the palate. There is still plenty of extract, though, and this lingers persistently on the finish. "

Crisp acidity defines this well-knit rosé, making a counterpoint to the lightly plush texture of the creamy mousse, with flavors of steeped raspberry, orange peel and pickled ginger showing a hint of smoke on the finish.

of their rosé (this one includes 30 percent cinsault and 15 percent grenache), and, though 2021 was another hot summer here, Romassan’s poor
limestone and sandstone soils produced a deeply savory wine. This pale Bandol seems to have inhaled the local scrubland and seaside breezes,
presenting that savory edge alongside husk cherry, grapefruit and pale melon flavors. Firm and versatile, it would pair nicely with anything from
bouillabaisse to a Niçoise salad; or take it abroad alongside chicken yakitori.- Seamlessly stitches together jasmine, pink grapefruit, tangerine, rose water and a savory accent, with a subtle twinge of fleur de sel adding a counterpoint to the lengthy finish. Graceful, but with nice underlying tension throughout. Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah and Mourvèdre. Drink now. "

Full-bodied yet so elegant. Structure with finesse and purity. The tannins are melted in the wine. Fabulous young wine. Try tasting it from 2023. The 2016 Canon La Gaffelière is just as striking from bottle as it was from barrel. Bright, intensely aromatic and precise, the 2016 has it all. Sweet red cherry, pomegranate, blood orange and rose petal all race through this silky, super-expressive Saint-Émilion. In 2016, Canon La Gaffelière is especially polished, refined and nuanced, which means also less overly powerful than in the past. It was compelling both times I tasted it from bottle. Bold tannins, rich fruit and good acidity combine in a wine that is powerful while always fresh. With acidity and stylish black-currant flavors, the wine’s fruitiness comes through the tannins, finishing with a juicy, perfumed aftertaste. Best after 2025. This delivers a very fresh, juicy ball of red and black currant preserve flavors laced liberally with bramble, roasted apple wood and sweet tobacco notes. Shows terrific purity, energy and drive, with a piercing echo of minerality through the mouthwatering finish. Best from 2022 through 2038. One of the most elegant and seamless wines in the vintage is the 2016 Canon-la-Gaffelière, a blend of 55% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Franc, and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon brought up in 60% new French oak. This medium to full-bodied beauty has brilliant minerality as well as tons of cassis fruits, notions of spice box, cedarwood, licorice, and dried earth, silky tannins, no hard edges, and a great, great finish. It shows the purity and elegance of the vintage to a T. Drink this fabulous Saint-Emilion any time over the coming 20+ years. Another successful wine in St-Émilion, with the signature of careful extraction. Well-brushed black fruits and a lovely push-and-pull effect between supple tannins, rich fruits and fresh acidity. Certified organic since the 2014 vintage. Drinking Window 2027 - 2045 Leading with a lovely, slightly sweet nose of red cherries and hardwoods and showing both a certain degree of elegance as well as an augmented sense of continuing fruity richness in its fairly bright and lively young flavors, this rich and yet decidedly graceful wine is predisposed more to polish than power. That said, it is no shrinking violet and has energy to spare as well as the silky, very fine tannins to warrant at least another five to eight years of keeping. "
102,Pommery Brut,Royal,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,49,12.5,4.4,136,"Civilised apple, lemon and dried fruit nose. There's a nice lift in the mouth with citric balance and real poise.

One third each of chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier. Base vintage 2018. 9-10g/L dosage. Drink now. An equal blend of the three major Champagne grape varieties, this cuvée is a reference in the region. It has a fine balance and is rich but with good touches of minerality as well as crisp white fruits. The finish with its bite of citrus is attractively refreshing. Drink the bottling now. "
103,Chateau de Bligny Grande Reserve Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,France,65,12,4.4,19,"This Champagne rosé shows some good complexity on the nose with bread crust and brioche to match some dried cranberries and raspberries. Direct acidity frames the fine layering of bubbles. Ripe black cherry, plum and spice notes are framed by juicy acidity, fine texture and a chalky base note in this well-knit rosé. Very approachable as an aperitif, but with structure to match light dishes. "
104,Louis Jadot Pouilly-Fuisse,2020,Chardonnay,France,31,12.84,4.1,44,"Crisp, fresh, and minerally, with great citrus fruit and racy

105,Stonestreet Estate Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,California,45,14.3,4.1,7,"Rich nose of vanilla crème brûlée then focused but generous flavours of yellow apple, plum and banana giving sunshine and warmth. A light touch of reductive winemaking gives a struck match and gunsmoke character to the finish, elegantly balancing the rich fruit. This wine gets its cool tones from the high altitudes at the Jackson family’s Alexander Mountain Estate, a 5,500-acre property on the western slopes of the Mayacamas Mountains. Lisa Valtenbergs builds the blend from a range of parcels, at elevations from 400 to 1,800 feet. While the texture is soft and mellow, the wine sustains a crisp green freshness and bright undertones of lemon. Satisfying to drink on its own, this will readily take on soft-shell crabs or other rich shellfish. "
106,Chateau Leoville Barton,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,169,13,4.2,62,"Terrific intensity of dark berries, almost peppery blackcurrants and violets with attractive and integrated, spicy oak and an earthy edge. The palate has a super powerful and long, linear core with plenty of fruit flesh strapped in tight for a long and thrilling ride into the finish. A blend of 86 per cent cabernet and 14 per cent merlot. Try from 2024. This is so vivid as it brims with pastis-soaked plum, blackberry, black currant and blueberry paste flavors, all carried by a perfectly integrated brambly spine. Tar and ganache notes give the finish an extra kick while everything stays within the mouthwatering roasted apple wood frame. Both regal and rambunctious, this is St.-Julien to a T. Best from 2025 through 2040. A brilliant young wine, the 2016 Léoville Barton unwinds in the glass with aromas of cassis, dark berries and cigar box mingled with subtle hints of loamy soil. Medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, it's seamless and exquisitely balanced, with beautifully refined tannins, bright acids and a long, penetrating finish. Its structural refinement is such that it's far from forbidding to open right now, yet patience will be richly rewarded. This vintage is dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, making it comparable to some top Pauillacs. The Barton family has owned these vineyards for centuries and always makes very fine claret, but this is exceptional. Opulent and vibrant nose, crammed with blackcurrant. Depth, grip and concentration, but balanced and stylish too, with notable freshness. For the long haul. Drinking Window 2024 - 2045 "
107,Chateau Labegorce,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,39,13,4.2,30,"The 2018 Château Labegorce is a perfumed, already complex Margaux based on 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 44% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Its medium ruby hue gives way to lovely notes of blueberries, raspberries, flowers, sandalwood, and assorted baking spice cabinet-like nuances. Medium to full-bodied, with beautifully pure fruit and silky tannins, it's a wine that grows on you with time in the glass. It's not a blockbuster, but it exudes elegance and class as well as balance. Enjoy bottles any time over the coming 20-25 years or more. Strong grilled oak on the nose that will settle down but definitely needs time. Black fruit comes through on the palate, and a ton of juice that is shot through the fruit and helps the entire thing to power along enjoyably. Good-quality.

155,Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,150,14.5,4.2,25,"Very perfumed and aromatic with blackcurrant, sweet-tobacco and Spanish-cedar character. Full-bodied with ultra fine tannins that build on the palate and take the fruit and other flavors to an endless finish. More refined than the perfect 2018 and almost as compelling. Drink in 2023 or after. The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Don Melchor is also 5% Cabernet Franc, 2% Merlot and 1% Petit Verdot and spent 15 months in 75% new French barrels. Vivid garnet in color. The rich, complex nose presents notes of black currant, mint, and hints of balsam and ash over a bed of oak and a whiff of cedar. In the mouth, hefty volume, fine-grained tannins and a broad expression combine, supported by a structure that is rather delicate for a wine of this intensity. The long-lasting finish ends with an aftertaste of fruit and mint before the oak has the final say. This will grow in the bottle. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Don Melchor stands tall as one of the world's top Cabernet Sauvignons, competing well against Bordeaux, Napa Valley, Red Mountain, and other major Cabernet enclaves. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of ripe fruit, dried earth, dust, wild herbs, and oak. Enjoy it with rosemary and garlic-infused roast leg of lamb. (Tasted: March 14, 2022, San Francisco, CA) A standout red, offering svelte entry but quickly accelerating to a rich and well-structured state, built around never wavering flavors of black cherry, plum and baking spice, which gain dimension from fresh mineral acidity and subtle loam and bay leaf nuances. Ends with rich, well-integrated and mouthcoating tannins as well as hints of cocoa. Drink now. There is a little more ripeness in the 2019 Don Melchor, which in warmer years shows notes of ripe plums and is subtly balsamic. The palate is round and powerful, with good balance and nice integration of the oak. As usual, there is a combination of elegance and power, with subtle mintiness and harmony. "

157,Clos Apalta,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,Chile,119,15,4.2,45,"This is really focused and refined with fantastic dried flowers and dark berries. Dried-lavender and mint undertones. Medium-to full-bodied with refined and polished tannins that are all together and so focused. Really integrated and melted together on the palate. Compact and very linear. Please give this two or three years to come completely together, but it’s already breathtaking. Better to drink after 2022. The 2016 Clos Apalta is a blend of 64% Carménère (higher than in 2015), 19% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Merlot hitting the scale at 15% alcohol with a pH of 3.7. The Carménère and Cabernet were planted ungrafted in 1920, and all the vineyards are organic and biodynamic (certified) and very low yielding. The hand-destemmed grapes fermented in oak vats and barriques (17%), and the wine went through malolactic and 26 months of aging in brand new French barriques. I've seen a great improvement in Carménère in Chile in the last few years, perhaps since they stopped wanting to grow it everywhere and focused on the places where it grows well, like the Apalta region. They have also learned to tame the green aromas and fierce tannins and alcohol and to produce much more harmonious reds, like this aromatic example that reveals spice, tobacco leaves, red fruit and floral notes without noticeable alcohol or excess ripeness. Refined, with savory richness to the mineral-infused raspberry, red currant and herbal shadings. Creamy hints emerge midpalate, leading to a crisp, well-structured finish that lingers with slate and cast iron notes. Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Drink now through 2025. "
158,Amici Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,49,14.5,4.2,45,"Perfumed cabernet with aromas of blackcurrants, blackberries, raspberries, thyme, violets, crushed stones and cloves. Full-bodied with firm, grainy tannins. Structured and concentrated. Better after 2023. Made with the goal of great Napa Cabernet at $50 bucks, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley succeeds admirably, offering gorgeous cassis, violet, and chocolaty aromatics as well as medium to full-bodied richness, a balanced, layered mouthfeel, and silky tannins. It competes with wines at three times the cost. The blend is 88% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% each of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, aged 20 months in 75% new barrels. "
159,Angeline California Pinot Noir,2021,Pinot Noir,California,15,13.8,4.0,19,"Lots of Central Coast character with a medium body. Dried strawberries, hints of cherries and a citrus undertone. Some wet earth, too. Medium body. Very fresh. "
160,Chalone Estate Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,30,14.5,4.1,10,"There's a core of rocky minerality alongside sharp lime peel and melon rind on the nose of this bottling. The palate is very soil- and rock-driven, which is typical of this rugged appellation, with chalk and gravelly soil flavors giving structure to the dried lime peel flavors. Distinctive, with a drizzle of wildflower honey to the peach cobbler, baked apple and ripe apricot flavors, backed by fresh, vibrant acidity that keeps all the flavors in focus. "
161,Borgo Scopeto Chianti Classico,2018,Sangiovese,Italy,21,13,3.9,272,"Tangy and lush with notes of violet and plum; rich and balanced, stylish and long. "

Give it a year or two to soften, but already very attractive. From organically grown grapes. Try after 2022. "
163,Ferrari,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Italy,28,12.5,4.1,235,"Aromas of white spring flower, white orchard fruit and a whiff of brioche lead the way. On the crisp palate, an elegant perlage accompanies creamy yellow apple, pear and lemon drop. COMMENTARY: The Ferrari Sparkling Wine is bright, crisp, and well-balanced. TASTING NOTES: This refined wine shows aromas and flavors tart apple, earth, and yeast. Pair it with a plate of ikura sashimi. (Tasted: May 11, 2020, San Francisco, CA) An Italian classic and a terrific value, the Ferrari NV Trento Brut is all Chardonnay that opens to crystalline luminosity and brilliance. The bouquet is straightforward and confident, delivering a clear and precise message of good cheer and easy-drinking appeal. There are notes of citrus, white peach, breakfast pastry and drying notes of crushed mineral. This is the quintessential Italian aperitivo wine. "
164,Marietta Cellars Christo,2018,Rhone Red Blends,California,23,15,3.8,124,"The 2018 Christo is made up of 60% Syrah, 24% Grenache, 12% Petite Sirah and 4% Viognier. Vibrant ruby-purple in color, the nose offers pure scents of crushed red, black and blue berries, tobacco, violets, tar and smoked meats. The palate is full-bodied and packed full of perfectly ripe, juicy fruit, with a grainy frame and loads of uplift on the finish. Very attractive aromas of blackberry, sweet tobacco and wet earth follow through to a full body with a round, soft texture. Smoke, tar and graphite notes. Flavorful finish. 60% syrah, 24% grenache, 12% petite sirah and 4% viognier. Drink or hold. "
165,Provenance Vineyards Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,60,15.2,4.0,34,"Fresh and layered with currants, plums and juicy fruit. Full-bodied, soft and velvety, yet fresh and dry on the finish. Drink or hold. "
166,Chateau Lafite Rothschild,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,039",0,4.0,14,"Lead and graphite are complimented by notes of blueberries and blackberries. Blackcurrants, too. Full-bodied and focused with very round and polished tannins. Elegance with power. Very classic nature for Lafite. Try in 2022. The power in this vintage of Lafite is hidden, but it is there in spades and tiptoes up along the palate. Lovely brushed tannins are extremely well placed, discreetly holding the fruit. In many ways this is a truly classic Lafite because it is understated and lyrical. It's a wine that demands you know Lafite to see just how beautifully it will develop, says winemaker Eric Kohler. The grand vin 2015 Lafite-Rothschild checks in as 91% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest Merlot that was brought all in 100% new oak. Director Eric Kohler (who replaced Charles Chevallier in 2015) told me the vintage suffered a touch of dilution but wasn’t a complicated year. The 2015 is an aristocratic, classy example from this estate that offers textbook lead pencil shavings, tobacco, smoked herbs, and graphite as well as a beautiful core of currant and cassis fruit. It’s the most refined and subtle of the first growths, has medium to full-bodied richness, building tannin, and undeniable class and charm. Give bottles 4-5 years of bottle age and enjoy over the following 2-3 decades. Velvet- and silk-textured red currant, raspberry and black cherry compote notes glide through, supported by a perfectly embedded graphite spine, while enticing violet, black tea and alder accents add range through the finish. Very refined and sneakily long. Best from 2025 through 2045. "
167,Leonetti Merlot,2020,Merlot,Washington,109,14.6,0.0,0,"Aromas of fleshy plum, blackberry and fresh mint. Full-bodied with tight tannins. Rich and cozy on the palate with an array of ripe, dark fruit. Layered and plush. Nice depth here. Fresh in the center palate. Best after 2024. Always bottled early, the 2020 Merlot is all varietal from a mix of sites in the Walla Walla Valley. It has a juicy, medium to full-bodied, chewy style on the palate as well as good purity in its ripe red and blue fruits, notes of tobacco, scorched earth, and graphite-like aromatics. It has some grippy, chalk tannins, and while rock-solid today, it's not a wine to hide away in the cellar. "
168,La Cana Albarino,2021,Albarino,Spain,20,13.5,3.9,115,"Fresh, bright and zesty with lime, nectarine and green apple. Some stones and green herbs, too. It shows excellent texture with lots of vibe coming from the tense and high-pitched acidity. Pure and pristine. The 2021 La Caña is slightly fresher, with gorgeous citrus, tangerine, and lychee fruit as well as a medium-bodied, very pure, clean, vibrant style on the palate. It's another impeccably made, clean, crisp, juicy white that's going to shine with just about any food out there. "
169,Luca Old Vine Malbec,2019,Malbec,Argentina,34,13.6,4.2,17,"Amazing depth and intensity to this old-vine malbec with blackberry and black-licorice character to the wine. Violets, too. It’s full and dense, yet remains energetic and long. Polished, refined tannins. A gorgeous, plush red. Drinkable now for its generosity, but let it mellow with a few years of bottle age. Better after 2024. Unctuous and fine-grained flavors of dark currant and ripe cherry are supported by medium-grained tannins in this red, which is creamy midpalate, with concentrated chocolate mousse notes on the finish. The 2019 Old Vine Malbec comes from old ungrafted vineyards irrigated by traditional flood irrigation in the Uco Valley in Mendoza. It's a floral, juicy and varietal Malbec with nicely integrated oak and a lively palate with pungent flavors, vibrant acidity and fine and round tannins. "
170,Laurent-Perrier La Cuvee Brut (375ML,half-bottle),Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,40,12,4.2,129,"The nonvintage cuvée from this producer is definitely on the dry side.

The nonvintage cuvée from this producer is definitely on the dry side. Like many Champagnes in the range, it has benefited from long aging before release, giving a wine that has richness as well as great fruits, hints of maturity coming through. Drink now. The NV Champagne La Cuvée Brut is aged for 4 years and sees 8 grams per liter dosage. The nose is very pretty and elegant, with floral aromas of brioche and sweet orchard fruits. Fresh with apricot, it is expressive of its lovely Chardonnay character. The palate is soft and approachable, and in line with the nose. This is a great aperitif style to begin with. Drink now or over the following 10 years. Best after 2022. "
171,Kanonkop Pinotage,2018,Pinotage,Africa,45,14.8,4.4,41,"The 2018 Pinotage comes from vines up to 65 years old, cropped at 5 tons/ha, and raised for 16 months in 80% new oak and 20% second fill. There is a little reduction on the nose, though this is brushed away with aeration to reveal black plum mixed with Christmas cake and a hint of licorice; fine delineation here. The palate is medium-bodied with impressive harmony and focus, the oak seamlessly integrated. There is fine backbone to this Pinotage, and a sustained white pepper finish that lingers. Outstanding. There’s a slight warmth to the nose of this wine, which opens with aromas of licorice root, char, baked plum and roasted blackberry alongside a touch of balsamic herbs and minty rooibos. It’s plush in feel and full in weight, with gripping tannins that support all of that ripe black fruit flavor. Ample acidity assists with balance, while the long finish shows beautiful evolution. Displaying a dark ruby core with purple and red hints on the rim, the 2018 Pinotage Stellenbosch opens with a nose of sweet, confected plums, black raspberry, mocha and hints of sweet oak spice. Medium to full-bodied, the wine displays sweet fruit on the palate with a generous helping of 80% new French oak. It ends with sappy plums and black cherry skin flavors that give way to tight tannins that linger on the long finish. There are plenty of winemaking practices happening with the expression that creates an enjoyable experience for the drinker. "
172,Billecart-Salmon Brut Rose (375ML,half-bottle),Sparkling Rosé,France,49,12,4.5,119,"COMMENTARY: After decades of tasting and savoring the Billecart-Salmon Brut Rosé Champagne, this wine remains one of my favorites wines in the world. TASTING NOTES: This wine is fresh, bright, and steady with its alluring aromas and flavors of red currants and strawberries. Enjoy it with fresh salmon and avocado hand rolls. (Tasted: April 22, 2021, San Francisco, CA) The NV Champagne Brut Rose is an attractive pale salmon hue, with a fresh perfume of wild strawberry, ripe peach, white and red flowers, a hint of tropical fruit, and grapefruit. The palate is rounded, with fruit up front and through the mid-palate, and it has a silky and fresh lift. There is a wonderful ease and drinkability to this wine, which delivers balance and finesse. Best after 2022. Attractive salmon color with aromas of dried strawberries and lemons, as well as hints of flowers. Full-bodied with tight tension from the fine phenolics that run through the palate. Hints of white pepper, peaches and sliced green strawberries with some candied lemons, too. Always an excellent bottle. 40% chardonnay, 30% pinot noir and 30% pinot meunier. Drink now. A dry style of brut, emphasizing great fruitiness, and with a touch of bottle age, this Champagne is ready to drink. Citrus, red fruits and tight minerality from the 40% Chardonnay in the blend, offer a wine under tension and worth aging another year in bottle. Drink now or from 2023. Delicate notes of yellow plum, marzipan, verbena and fleur de sel are set in this firm and finely meshed rosé Champagne. Creamy finish. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Drink now. "
173,Produttori del Barbaresco Barbaresco,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,51,15,4.3,21,"Packaged in its distinctive brown paper label, the Produttori del Barbaresco 2018 Barbaresco is a beautifully lean and luminous expression of Nebbiolo, and that pretty color should remain intact over time. The aromas are bold and ripe with dark and purple fruit, but the bouquet shows interesting twists with earth, truffle, licorice and grilled herb. As the wine opens in the glass, you begin to notice heavier aromas of raisin and dried apricot.It wears a warm-vintage signature for sure, and for that reason, I would suggest a shorter drinking window for the 2018. Best After 2023. Lovely barbaresco, with all the typical nebbiolo characteristics, such as red berries, mushrooms and dried leaves, as well as hints of bitter orange peel and spice. All this follows through to the medium-to full-bodied palate, where fine, lightly firm tannins add a little grip and additional focus. Compact, but bursting with flavor. Delicious now, but give it a year or two. It will only get better. Violet and red berry aromas mingle with dark spice, leather and camphor. The full-bodied palate offers cherry marinated in spirits, orange rind, black tea and a hint of menthol alongside solid tannins. "
174,Doubleback Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Washington,159,0,0.0,0,"Aromas of cassis, bark and rosemary. Medium-to full-bodied with silky tannins.

176,Gosset Grande Reserve,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,70,12,4.2,78,"The nose opens with the fresh ripeness of yellow apple and highlights of Granny Smith. It has beautifully subtle autolysis on the palate, deepening into notes of creamy apple crumble, Golden Delicious and Mirabelle plum, while remaining utterly strait-laced. Elegance, length and absolute freshness are inherent and quietly convincing. A spine of chiseled acidity structures this vivid, creamy Champagne, which has a minerally underpinning of smoke and brine and flavors of Asian pear, baked pineapple, lemon curd, toasted brioche and roasted almond. Should pair well with grilled fish. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier Gosset’s nonvintage cuvée is a fine example of the richness of this producer’s Champagnes. It is full, laden with Pinot texture and a touch of toast from bottle aging. Drink now. The NV Grande Reserve Brut, which is 45% Chardonnay, 45% Pinot Noir, and the rest Pinot Meunier and 8 g/l dosage, is lifted with tropical and citrus fruit including lychee, orange blossom, and lime. Juicy and medium-bodied, with tangerine and mango, it is a solid entry to the range. Best after 2022. "
177,Bodegas Muga Reserva,2018,Tempranillo,Spain,33,14.5,4.2,60,"This was the only red that Muga made in 2018, and the wines from the best vineyards went into the blend. In other words, top vineyards were declassified. Medium-bodied with very fine tannins that are caressing and refined. Plenty of subtle berries, chocolate and walnuts. The 2018 Muga Reserva is a similar blend and has pretty, slightly fresher notes of darker, almost blue fruits as well as violets, spring flowers, and cedary oak. More medium-bodied on the palate, it shows the fresher, elegant style of the vintage, has beautiful tannins, no hard edges, and outstanding length on the finish. "
178,Chateau de Saint Cosme Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2018,Rhone Red Blends,France,69,14.5,4.4,8,"A sleek, savory-edged version, which is also tightly coiled for the vintage, with red currant, plum and bitter cherry fruit notes lined by tobacco, dried garrigue and lavender. Delivers a nice, piercing iron note on the finish and has some latent depth, so no immediacy is necessary. Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Cinsault. Brilliant violet. Pungent red berry and cherry aromas are complemented by emerging floral and succulent herb nuances. Alluringly sweet and juicy on the palate, offering concentrated black raspberry, cherry and candied lavender flavors that deepen through the back half. Finishes supple, spicy and long, with lingering floral and cherry notes and gentle tannic grip.  "
179,Penfolds Grange,2017,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,850,14.5,0.0,0,"Memorable, complex, aromatic and explosively deep, with a mix of palo santo, dark chocolate, black olive, espresso and hazelnut butter. The pure fruit at the core is a mix of ripe huckleberry, boysenberry and wild blackberry, with dense but polished tannins. Savory notes of dried rosemary and sage, cigar box, dried apricot and sandalwood linger on the epic finish. Drink now. Opaque, bright-rimmed ruby. Highly pungent, smoke- and mineral-accented aromas of cherry pit, violet candy, cured tobacco, savory herbs, coconut and exotic spices on the kaleidoscopic nose. Shows superb clarity and spicy lift to its spice-laced bitter cherry, cassis, blueberry and floral pastille flavors, which take on black cardamom, menthol and cola nuances as the wine slowly stretches out. Shows superb delineation and spicy thrust on the youthfully tannic finish, which features resonating cherry, blue fruit and floral notes. COMMENTARY: The 2017 Penfolds Bin 95 Grange is fully packed on the palate and offers a lasting finish. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas of bold black fruit and complementary oak nuances. Lay it in the cellar for a decade before serving it with a grilled Porterhouse steak topped with diced shallots. (Tasted: November 16, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Surprisingly approachable, the seamless meld of fresh red fruits, mocha and liquorice makes for an especially friendly and agreeable young Grange. A fabulous bouquet immediately draws you in – a meadow of wild herbs amid an orchard of plums – while the long palate shows impressive drive. Some spiky raw notes stick out at the end, along with assertive oak, showing that this vintage is still growing into its sturdy frame. This starts with a deeply spicy and brooding nose that packs plenty of (100% new) American oak, some smoked vanilla and ripe dark plums and berries. The palate has a youthful, astringent feel with sinewy oak tannin and deep plum and dark-berry flavors, carrying a big frame of fruit extract. Big, round berries strive towards boldness. A blend of Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale. 100% shiraz. Drink over the next two decades. Strongly marked—as always—by its 100% American oak elevage, the 2017 Grange backs up the cedar and vanilla notes with ample blackberry and cassis fruit. Full-bodied, ripe and almost decadently creamy in the mouth, it's loaded with substance, concentrated and rich, yet—in the context of Grange—relatively light and elegant-seeming on the finish. Only the seventh-ever Grange to be exclusively Shiraz, it originates from Barossa Valley (86%) and McLaren Vale (14%); Shiraz from other growing regions in South Australia failed to make the grade this year.

Inky dark purplish fruit, savory herbs, menthol, licorice and spice. The purity of the fruit is remarkable today. There is plenty of youthful Howell Mountain tannin, so readers will have to be patient. Bright floral accents lift the red/purplish berry fruit nicely. This is such an expressive, alluring Cabernet. Ripe and very juicy, with a youthfully compact set of plum, boysenberry and blackberry compote flavors wrapped in licorice and violet notes. This is both racy and grippy, showing serious power but with the freshness and drive to match. Delivers a long, iron accent that scores the fruit through the finish. Best from 2024. "
183,Etude Carneros Estate Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,48,14.1,4.2,36,"Vivid strawberry and dried-flower aromas here with hints of sandalwood. Medium to full body with firm, creamy tannins and a tangy finish. Opulent. Tight and focused. Pumice and black and white-pepper notes. A pretty wine already, but give it a year or two to open and soften. A well-made, larger production offering, this wine is richly layered in strawberry, raspberry and black tea, the oak slightly sweet and toasty. Smoky overtones provide a hint of game and earth, leading to a cohesive, resolved finish.  "

There's a lot to like about this version, which leads off with warmed fruitcake and red licorice notes, followed quickly by bramble-lined raspberry, blackberry and cherry compote flavors.

Hints of dried rosemary and thyme give this mouth-watering savoriness. Juicy dark berries and mushrooms on the palate. It's full-bodied with firm tannins. Chewy. The 2016 Brunello has baked aromas of fig, tar and turned earth. The palate is savory with tea leaf, cherry pit, and pine resin. It is full-bodied and rich with ripe tannin and warming spice. Col di Lamo is an organic estate. Col di Lamo was established by Giovanna Neri when she parted ways with her brother Giacomo Neri of Casanova di Neri in the mid-1990s. From two small vineyards in Montalcino’s northeastern zone of Torrenieri she fashions this satisfyingly chewy, slightly rustic yet flavourful Brunello. It’s packed with dark fruit and offset by wildflower, forest floor, cinnamon and clove. Clayey tannins grip the palate and zesty, citrussy acidity brings it to its close. "

Full-bodied and rich with lots of fruit and chewy tannins. Savory. 50% merlot, 40% cabernet sauvignon and 10% petit verdot. Needs two or three years to soften. This is lush, yet dense and lively, offering black cherry, blackberry and black currant fruit, shaded by mineral, cedar and spice elements. Firms up by the finish, echoing fruit, mineral and spice accents, with fine length. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Best from 2024  "
189,Beringer Knights Valley Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,70,14.5,4.3,11,"Aromas of black tea, blackberry and tobacco leaf. Full-bodied with velvety, slightly tense tannins. Lovely black-fruited palate with dried-flower and herb character. Roses, violets and sage. Nicely balanced and long. Lovely density in the center-palate. Beringer's 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve Knights Valley starts off life as a block selection from the huge vineyard's rockiest parcel, then gets trimmed down further in the winery by winnowing out lots and barrels that don't quite make the cut. The result is a wine that boasts lovely Cabernet florals and pretty cassis fruit. It's bigger, richer and fuller-bodied than the regular KV bottling, more concentrated, but also smoother, silkier and longer on the finish. The affordable price tag and widespread availability (5,717 cases produced) should make this a steakhouse staple. "
190,Warre's Vintage Port,2017,Port,Portugal,140,20,0.0,0,"Loads of wet earth and grape aromas with hints of stems. Old vine aromas of bark and moss. Full-bodied, sweet and structured with a big kick on the end. Very impressive. Exceptional layers of fruit and energy. A stronger and more muscular Warre. Lush and inviting in feel, with a beautifully creamy texture that lets plum
sauce, blueberry reduction and raspberry pâte de fruit flavors glide along
effortlessly. Notes of violet, anise and black tea are beguiling in the
background before melding seamlessly on the finish. This shimmers with
fruit, balanced by depth and spine. Best from 2035 through 2055 This is an unusually powerful vintage of Warre’s— “A huge wine,” said Craig Ganzer, a rare-wine appraiser who joined our 2017 Porto panel. “As big and rich as it is, it’s not clunky or cloying.” The power and mass comes from different sides, including a heavy drape of oak and a complete range of fruit at what feels like optimal ripeness, with raspberry and darker blueberry notes creating a mouthwatering sensation. Notes of hibiscus and pressed flowers tie directly into the tannins through the wine’s beeswax density. This has the remarkable integration that is a hallmark of the vintage, and a vinous character that should be fascinating to revisit as the wine ages.  A ripe, floral wine that has many layers of black fruits with a fresh touch of acidity. The wine is dense while also elegant and poised with tannins and fruit already in balance. That suggests the Port will age relatively quickly. Drink from 2025. "
191,Domaine de la Janasse Chateauneuf-du-Pape Cuvee Chaupin,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,95,15.5,0.0,0,"I was blown away by the 2020 Châteauneuf Du Pape Chaupin, a 100% Grenache release that comes almost exclusively from the Chaupin lieu-dit in the northern part of the appellation. It's never as inky-hued or powerful as the Vieilles Vignes but always screams Grenache with its sexy, ripe, seamless, and remarkably elegant style. The 2020 offers a translucent ruby/purple hue as well as incredible aromatics of blackberries, black raspberries, peppery garrigue, herbes de Provence, and flowers, and it opens up nicely with time in the glass. Full-bodied and concentrated on the palate, it has silky tannins, no hard edges, and a great finish. I finished my note with ""a Grenache lover's dream."" This is up with the finest vintages produced and will evolve for 15+ years. Best after 2022 Full-bodied, generous in fruit and glycerol. The tannins and acidity seem to meld together into a single vertebral column. The alcohol is present, lending sweetness rather than heat. Remarkably elegant for a wine of these dimensions, with great, rising, upright flavours and structure. This is a very special wine with a long finish. Parcels of Grenache planted on lieux-dits Chapouin, La Janasse and La Crau, the oldest planted in 1912. Ripe but very focused, with a streamlined feel to the mix of raspberry, red currant and bitter cherry fruit flavors. Reveals a racy apple wood note coursing underneath, while licorice, black tea and graphite fill in through the finish.  "

193,High Valley Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,32,14.9,3.9,80,"This wine wraps ripe black cherries and tempting dark chocolate in good acidity and moderate tannins for great balance. It's full bodied but vibrant, showcasing the black-fruit and subtle oak nuances. "
194,Sonnet Black Ridge Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,California,45,13.9,0.0,0,"Rich aromas of black cherry are doused in oak on the nose of this bottling. There's a ton of woodspice on the palate, where oak frames the roasted red fruit and clove flavors. "
195,Chateau Cantenac Brown,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,61,13.5,4.5,10,"Ripe black fruits shine through this balanced wine, showing strongly against a backdrop of rich, generous tannins. This estate is one to watch as it achieves the form the vineyard deserves. Expect this wine to be ready to drink from 2026. Shows a touch of dark earth out front, with a mix of smoldering tobacco, espresso crema and singed alder notes before the core of warmed plum and blackberry reduction flavors finally starts to unwind. Just a touch burly for a Margaux, but certainly lots to like here and ample range and length. Time will likely add that last bit of refinement. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Rich and polished aromas of blueberry, lavender, dark chocolate, hazelnut and sweet tobacco. It’s full-bodied with firm, velvety tannins. Creamy layers of ripe fruit and wood. Long and caressing. Lovely ripe fruit in the center palate. Try from 2024. This is delicious, silky in texture and filled with luscious black fruits, exotic spiced liquorice and sweet blackberry. Touches of grilled cedar and just a trace of heat appear at the final furlong, along with a hint of menthol. The tannins close their fist around the fruit, reflecting the small berry size in the Cabernets, the percentage of which is slightly up this year as new plantings have come on line. It's an impressive construction, a little less elegant than the 2016 but with a ton of personality and a sense of bursting out of its borders, not yet fully tamed - and hugely appealing as a result. 60% new oak barrels. Drinking Window 2027 - 2042. A classic, elegant Margaux based on roughly 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot (I don't know the exact blend), the 2018 Château Cantenac Brown offers up a pretty perfume of red and black currants, sandalwood, dried flowers, and cedar pencil. It's not the most powerful or concentrated wine in the vintage, yet it has fine tannins as well as a wonderfully balanced, classical style. I suspect it will benefit from just short-term cellaring and keep for 20-25 years. "
196,Philipponnat Royale Reserve,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,80,12,4.6,62,"This is the nonvintage Champagne from this producer. With its richness and high percentage of Pinot Noir, it reflects the house style. Touches of spice and a light structure give shape to the white fruits. Drink now. Focused on pinot noir (65 percent, particularly fruit from Mareuil-sur-Aÿ), this blend includes up to 30 percent reserve wines aged in oak barrels. The red fruit comes through in the wine’s scent of currants and in its gentle grip, its savor combining a sense of transparent red-grape skins and the refreshing acidity of fruit grown in limestone. A fragrant element of lightly toasted hazelnut is a rich base note in this fine and creamy Champagne, layered with finely meshed flavors of baked white cherry, lemon curd, spun honey and pickled ginger. Plush in texture, with a fine spine of lemony acidity providing focus and definition. Always open in the exposition of the origins of its wines, Philipponnat has upped the stakes of late by not only adding foudres to its vinification armoury but also increasing volumes from two separate Réserves Perpétuelles. The result is impressive; Pinot power writ large in red fruit and biscuity complexity, with resonance on the back palate, the ensemble still harnessed by disarmingly energetic freshness. Plenty of lemons, nectarines, sliced apples, tarte tatin and pastries on the nose, leading to a silky and creamy palate. Succulent stone-fruit notes. Well integrated bubbles. 69% pinot noir, 28% chardonnay and 3% pinot meunier.  The current release of the NV Champagne Royale Reserve Brut is 69% Pinot Noir, 28% Chardonnay, and the rest Meunier, mostly from the 2018 harvest and 26% reserve wine. It has a pale straw color and is fresh with white flowers, ripe peach, and rounded brioche. The palate is approachable and refreshing, with pithy citrus of lemon and orange, red fruits, and bread dough. Its ripe but fresh style casts a large net. Best after 2022. "
197,Stags' Leap Winery Petite Sirah,2018,Petite Sirah,California,47,14.4,4.2,80,"Lots of ripe plums and blueberries, together with smoked meat, licorice and dried flowers. Dark chocolate and wet forest floor, too. Tight and meaty with a dense, chewy tannin structure. Full-bodied, ripe and fruit-driven. Long, savory finish. Try now, but better after a year or two. "
198,Duckhorn The Discussion,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,144,14.5,0.0,0,"A deep but scented nose, with an attractive gravel note added to the aroma profile of blueberries, cassis and plums. Full-bodied and tight on the palate, showing well-crafted tannins that are tight and supportive to the juicy berries and plush oak spices. Long and layered finish.  COMMENTARY: The 2019 Duckhorn Vineyards Discussion Red Wine is well-made, well-balanced, and slightly elevated.

201,Chateau Lynch-Moussas,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,39,14.5,4.4,17,"This is a solid Pauillac with a medium to full body and chewy tannins that are polished and energetic . Plenty of blackcurrant, lemon and wet-earth character. A little tight at the end. Needs at least three or four years of bottle age to open. Will age very nicely. Mulled red and black fruits, smoked tobacco, sandalwood, lead pencil, and spring flower notes all emerge from the 2019 Château Lynch-Moussas, a medium-bodied, elegnat Pauillac with ripe tannins, good acidity, and a focused, concentrated style that will reward 4-5 years of bottle age. This outstanding 2019 will have two decades or more of prime drinking. Best After 2026 Offers mulled plum, fig and blackberry fruit flavors that unfurl slowly over a velvety structure, while dark tobacco, cast iron and bay leaf details emerge through the slightly dusty finish. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Best from 2023. "
202,Casanova di Neri Brunello di Montalcino Cerretalto,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,419,15,4.9,5,"Cerretalto is bottled separately in selected vintages only. It is given an additional year of ageing and is typically still patently austere when released. While the 2015 was almost uncharacteristically fleshy, 2016 is a return to Cerretalto’s sinewy personality. It opens gradually with distinct flint, creosote and smoke-infused wild black currants and thyme. The palate is powerful without being weighty, with chiselled tannins that are rigid but not hard-edged. A concentrated core of black salted liquorice, black raspberry and iron is pierced by tangy acidity. Ultimately an elegant wine, this will need time to express all its nuance.
Drinking Window 2025 - 2045 Here's an important keepsake from a classic vintage. The Casanova di Neri 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Cerretalto needs time to open, especially if you plan to drink the wine earlier than is recommended (you're best off waiting five years or more). This powerful wine is packed tight with black fruit, plum and summer ripe cherry. Those dark fruit tones segue to spice, baked clay, balsam herb and gardening soil. The oak is always more apparent in the Cerretalto (which is released one year later, as if it were a Riserva) compared to the Tenuta Nuova. The vineyard used makes a big difference, giving this wine more textural weight and thicker fiber. It's all a question of taste, but if you want power (with 15% alcohol), richness, sensuality and voluptuousness in your Brunello, Cerretalto is the bottle at the end of the rainbow. Best after 2025. A dense, racy and expressive red, offering black cherry, black currant, violet, iron and a hint of rosemary aromas and flavors. This is driven by vivid acidity and refined tannins, which lend both finesse and length. Features great harmony and elegance. Best from 2025. "
203,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon (1.5 Liter Magnum),2014,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,429,14.5,4.9,6,"The 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon Cask 23 is a smoking effort from this team. Revealing a deep purple color and stunning notes of blackcurrants and black raspberries like fruit, it offers loads of spice, cedar and dried flower nuances, full-bodied richness, a ripe, full-bodied, majestic texture, beautiful tannin quality, and a great finish. This sensational 2014 has a rare mix of power and elegance and will keep for 20-25 years. Winemaker Marcus Notaro blends this wine from two adjacent estate-owned vineyards farmed by Kirk Grace. Fay, with its alluvial soils, provides 44 percent of the blend in 2014; the balance comes from S.L.V., where the vines rise higher up the eastern bench of Stag’s Leap, rooted in the crush of volcanic rock that has washed down off the palisades. They combine in a cabernet with cool richness, layering fruit notes of chocolate and wild mushrooms with a rush of satiny fruit tannins. There are no barriers to obscure the wine’s youthful integration or its complexity, still incipient, but there in the breath for minutes, compellingly fresh and satiating in its savor. Cask 23 is a selection of the finest barrels produced from the estate's vineyards. This is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in 90% new oak. The oak is very evident on the intense blackcurrant nose, yet it doesn't dominate. The palate is suave and broad, given texture with fine-grained tannins. There's impeccable balance and poise, and a long lingering finish, thanks to the wine's fine acidity. Glorious aromas of blacberries and blackcurrants follow through to a full body, ultra-fine tannins and an alluring finish. It shows such polish and verve. Try it in 2020, but it's already a show to taste. Shows the pedigree. Deftly balanced, creamy and smooth-textured, with an elegant array of red and dark berry, anise, cedar and mocha flavors, ending with fine-grained tannins and a splash of mocha. Drink now through 2032. "

205,Gaja Sperss Barolo,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,349,14.5,0.0,0,"Very intense aromas of roasted hazelnuts with dried flowers, tar and fruit. Full-bodied and very tight with a solid core of chewy yet refined tannins, this is a classically proportioned Barolo that displays superb structure and length. A thoroughly great wine. Try after 2025. Following so quickly after the celestial 2016 vintage, this Gaja 2017 Barolo Sperss shows muscle and brawn; however, the Conteisa holds its own in terms of aromatic complexity. With fruit from Serralunga d'Alba, that added concentration and determination are expected, especially in a hot and dry vintage such as 2017. Here you get dark cherry fruit with cassis and wild plum. There are also floral aromas that veer toward red rose more than they do violets or blue flowers. And, of course, you get some of those iron-rich or mineral notes of rusty nail or iron that are often associated with Sperss. In 2017, according to Rossana Gaja, Sperss was picked almost a month after the start of the harvest on 18 September. Coming from Serralunga, this interpretation of Barolo exhibits a dark profile of earthy tones and chocolate, with graceful jam-like cherry, orange peel and violet. Thick and extracted on the mid-palate with crisp acidity, the structure is perfectly woven into its restrained plummy fruits and liquorice finish. It's not showing much poise at present, but clearly has a long life ahead. Drinking Window 2021 - 2040. A fluid style, this red displays cherry, raspberry, currant, earth and tobacco flavors. Iron and tar accents join in as the dense swath of tannins adds closure. Overall, this is light on its feet, intense and lively, hanging together nicely. "
206,Belle Glos Clark and Telephone Vineyard Pinot Noir,2021,Pinot Noir,California,55,14.8,0.0,0,"This is a very bold style of Pinot Noir, so much that it’s not very reflective of the grape but would work well paired with a juicy grilled steak.

At the southeastern limit of Chianti Classico, Fèlsina’s expansive vineyards look towards Montalcino. The annata is assembled from various parcels rising from 320 to 420 metres on rocky calcareous soil with layers of sandstone. As usual, it is more earthy than fruity, bringing in evocative accents of violet, liquorice and pepper. The palate is superbly textured with fine, grainy tannins providing a sensuous grip. Dark fruited and tangy with admirable depth, it will drink well now and over the next decade. Finishes with a sprinkle of cinnamon. One of the best vantage points for drinking Chianti Classico is at the entry level. A wine like the Fèlsina 2019 Chianti Classico Berardenga offers so much freshness and cheerful, easy-drinking appeal. It's a terrific partner to pizza, pasta or basically anything on the trattoria menu tonight. This wine shows bright cherry flavors and redcurrant with pressed flowers and some tangy blood orange. It is steady and generous, with lots of bright primary intensity. This is lively, its cherry, strawberry and orange peel flavors picking up earth and woodsy accents. Firm tannins sweep in on the finish, yet this stays fresh and long. A touch more austere than many '19s. "

It’s low-intervention winemaking with a stunning result: The wildly exotic aromatics bring lavender, violets, plum, smoked tea, olive and, above all, pepper—like walking under a pepper tree on a warm afternoon as the fruit nears peak ripeness. The flavors are exotic, lush and herbal at once, delivered with a creamy midpalate and fine leafy tannins, elegant and long. It’s drinking beautifully now and would be a wonder to follow as it ages. The 2019 Syrah Estate has a medium ruby-purple color and is bursting with blackberry jam and blueberry aromas with broody tones of cast iron, chargrill, aniseed and dried herbs.

Tight on the finish, aromatic and very flavorful, this actually opens rather well and shows off its lovely fruit. The Dow's will be approachable a bit earlier, perhaps, and this may reward aging even more. As always, Graham's is wonderfully delicious. That's one hallmark of the house. I'm not sure this is a truly great Graham's, but at the moment, it is enticing, with plenty of potential for improvement.  "
231,Paul Hobbs Coombsville Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,129,14.6,4.6,8,"Attractive aromas of blue fruit, mint, bark and sweet tobacco follow through to a medium body with fine tannins and a lovely, balanced finish. Not the biggest wine, but all about finesse and deliciousness. This is a change for the Napa Valley bottling, from mostly Paul Hobbs vineyards in Coombsville. Drink after 2022. Ripe and well-defined, with a mix of açaí berry, blueberry and blackberry notes driving along, laced with dark earth and sweet tobacco. Solidly grippy, with a bolt of iron through the finish. A textbook introduction to Coombsville. Best from 2022 through 2032. "
232,Black Stallion Winery Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,35,0,4.2,86,"A fragrant nose of mulberries, plums, cedar, cloves and vanilla. Medium-to full-bodied with fine, firm tannins and vivid acidity. Structured, with fruity character and a creamy texture. Chewy finish. Try from 2023. "
233,Shannon Ridge High Elevation Zinfandel,2020,Zinfandel,California,23,13.9,3.7,26,"Great black fruit flavors and a warm, broad texture are well supported by moderate tannins in this full-bodied, ripe and pleasing wine. Black plum, blackberry and a touch of black pepper are all vivid on the palate and lingering on the finish. "

235,Chateau Pontet-Canet,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,169,14.5,4.5,19,"The 2018 Pontet-Canet is a blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. It was aged in 55% oak barriques and 45% amphorae. Deep garnet-purple colored, it explodes from the glass with an atomic perfume of raspberry pie, blackcurrant pastilles, rose oil and Chinese five spice, giving way to suggestions of cinnamon stick, dusty soil, pencil lead and underbrush. The rich, seductive, full-bodied palate is a hedonist's dream, delivering layer-upon-layer of black and red berry preserves with loads of fragrant accents, a beautifully firm yet plush texture and tons of freshness, finishing long with a whole firework display of exotic spices. This is pretty much out-of-the-gate delicious, but it has the backbone to evolve over three decades or more. This wine combines the richness of the vintage with a sophisticated structure of smoky tannins and spicy wood aging. It is still young, with a powerful structure and ripe, vibrant black-currant fruits. The wine needs plenty of aging. Drink from 2028. Organic and biodynamic A complex nose of blueberries, elderberries, dried fruit, spice and dark chocolate. It’s full-bodied with a harmonious, balanced texture. The tannins are still firm and powerful, but there’s balance and finesse to the whole thing. Tight and reserved, yet long and energetic. The tannins open slowly. Dusty texture. From biodynamically grown grapes. Try after 2024. In the glass you get a richly nuanced and aromatic glass of Pontet. Plum, gooseberry, cassis, rosemary, violet, tobacco leaf, sage and white pepper. Clear freshness, with beautiful floral aromatics through the palate - peony alongside the deeply textured fruit. A touch of bitterness on the finish and in the final moments the tannic grip of Pauillac takes hold. Has its own character and it feels very much of itself. Extremely small yields in this year, in which mildew meant they lost two-thirds of the crop. 55% new oak, 45% amphorae. Drinking Window 2027 - 2042 "
236,Penfolds Bin 407 Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,79,14.5,4.7,5,"An amalgam of redcurrant and blackcurrant aromas with cedary and leafy tones, dark berries and pepper and plenty of oak strut. The palate has a deep vein of black-fruit flavors, as well as plum and chocolate. Bold extract. A blend of Padthaway, Coonawarra, Wrattonbully, McLaren Vale and Barossa Valley. Drink now. Polished from top to bottom, this red boasts fine-grained tannins, offering a generous core of blackberry and cassis flavors that show accents of cured black olive, sandalwood and vanilla-laced cedar, with a whiff of peppermint and dried sage, all harmonious on the long finish. Drink now. While the 2019 Bin 407 Cabernet Sauvignon shows ample concentration and ripe tannins, there's a pervasive herbal note. While some will call it Cabernet's varietal character—and I won't dispute that a bit of pyrazine is indeed endemic to the Cabernet family of grapes—balance is key. To this taster, there's just a bit too much mint and other green stuff for me to go gaga over the 2019 Bin 407. It's still an excellent wine, with plenty of weedy cassis fruit, a ripe, lush feel on the medium to full-bodied palate and a velvety, dark-chocolate finish. Sourced from Padthaway, Coonawarra, Wrattonbully, McLaren Vale and Barossa Valley, it spent a year in a combination of French and American hogsheads. "
237,Silverado Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,60,14.3,4.2,40,"With some Merlot, Petit Verdot, and Caber- net Franc blended in, this standup Cabernet Sauvignon aged 17 months in primarily French oak, seeing some Hungarian and American oak as well. Sourced from the winery’s estate vineyards (Mt. George, Silverado, and Oakville Station), the fruit yielded tight-fisted tannins of coffee and plum skin that hold this superbly structured, concentrated, and elegant red together. Chewy, with earthy undertones and depth defined by dark choco- late and black olive. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Silverado Vineyards Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon is rich yet not overpowering. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of sandalwood, black fruit, licorice, and oak. Pair it with a steak salad. (Tasted: December 20, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Ripe cassis, toast, vanilla and spice nose. Sleek tannins and appetising acidity. Precisely defined blackcurrant and black plum flavours and well-integrated oak. Blend : 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot With small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc included, this elegant red shows graceful layers of plum, black cherry and currant built around a soft, supple midpalate. Approachable and youthful, it's a wine to enjoy in the near term. A strong young Napa Valley cabernet, this wine needs hours in a decanter for the tannins to begin to soften their grip. It slowly gives up that initial severity to yield notes of dried figs, gaining flesh to wrap around the tannins. There’s a good wine here that requires patient cellaring. "
238,Ehlers Estate Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,72,14.5,0.0,0,"Really solid, this red has a brambly edge, with plum, blackberry and red currant preserve notes showing good energy, thanks in part to a buried sassafras streak, all backed by a roasted apple wood- and licorice snap-fueled finish. Drink now through 2030. "

Ripe and inviting on the palate. COMMENTARY: The 2021 Yealands Estate Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc is youthful, fresh, and well-built. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers pleasing aromas and flavors of grapefruit peel and savory spices. Enjoy it with a dozen raw oysters. (Tasted; October 3, 2021, San Francisco, CA) The heady aromas we've come to expect from NZ Sauvignon Blanc are out in full force here: freshly sliced green bell pepper, passionfruit, guava, lime and grapefruit pith, with a little of that feline pungency. It's balanced, fresh, slippery and crisp with the ultimate drinkability factor. "

Full-bodied with a super intense bead of perfectly placed fruit and tannin. There’s slight firmness to the tannin at the end, so wait a year for perfect integration. Beautiful quality here. Not overly complex, but such good winemaking. Best from 2023. Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo Nero, this soft, full-bodied red has aromas of new leather, ripe plum and dark spice. On the enveloping, accessible palate, velvety tannins accompany fleshy black cherry, coconut and coffee bean before a bitter almond close.  "
243,Castello Romitorio Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,275,15,0.0,0,"The 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva lifts up with elegance and richness, as sweet lavender and violets give way to a more savory display of black cherries, Tuscan dust and cedar box with hints of cooling mint. This rushes the palate with sweet red fruits and spices, silky yet lifted, and displaying a delicacy not expected from the Riserva category, yet quite welcome. Beneath is a core of power and density just waiting to unfold. Minerality comes through in the finale, mingling with a fine coating of tannin and hints of spicy citrus. This harmonious Brunello will have a very long life. The Riserva is a selection of two Brunello barrels, one tonneau and one large cask, from Romitorio’s cellar. Simply stunning. Drinking Window: 2026 - 2038. The 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva (with 6,300 bottles made) works beautifully to produce a lasting sense of harmony that reflects the best qualities of this classic vintage. Part of that playlist is power, and indeed this wine registers 15% alcohol, which is high, but the freshness of these vineyard sites and the wine's acidity does a good job of mitigating that power. The fruit is polished and refined in this Riserva, and there is a pretty mix of both primary and even some distant tertiary character to shape a bouquet that is pure but also complex. Castello Romitorio harvests in two stages. The first is an early selection of the smallest, loosest bunches across the oldest vineyards and fills one single tank. In years when the estate Brunello can stand alone, this is bottled separately as a Riserva. The tenth since 1987, the 2016 is wondrously earthy in its overture of clay, mineral rock and iron. It evolves into an autumnal smokiness then lands on balsamic herbs and crunchy red woodland berries. Youthful vigor and verve do not conceal intrinsic finesse. Acid crunch and dramatic mouth-caressing tannins will see this through the long haul. Drinking Window: 2024 - 2038. "
244,Tenuta San Guido Guidalberto,2020,Bordeaux Red Blends,Italy,70,14,0.0,0,"Nice freshness on the palate with plums and berries and citrusy acidity. It’s medium-bodied with fine tannins and a powdery texture. Hints of mushrooms. You can enjoy this young, but it will age nicely, too. Drink or hold. A lively, fluid red, displaying cherry, black currant, cedar, iron and spice aromas and flavors. Taut and balanced, with a slightly reserved finish today. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Drink now through 2028. "
245,Yalumba Samuel's Collection Shiraz,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,20,14,3.8,220,"Silky and inviting, with layers of perfumed blackberry and smoky dark fruit, while the palate is laced with peppery spice. A rich, blackberry and raspberry nose. Softly supple palate with a fresh and vivid core of ripe raspberry, red-plum and blackberry flavors. Nicely rounded out, with some good concentration. Drink now. Screw cap. COMMENTARY: The 2017 Yalumba Samuel's Collection Shiraz brings a pleasing mix of nuances onto the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits dried earth, rustic spices, and anise aromas and flavors that would pair beautifully with slowly-braised meat dishes. (Tasted: July 27, 2020, San Francisco, CA) "
246,Beaulieu Vineyard Reserve Tapestry,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,65,14.7,4.3,9,"This is layered, with chewy tannins and attractive blackcurrant and blackberry character. Chocolate and walnut highlights. Full and flavorful, but not heavy in any sense of the word. Cabernet sauvignon, merlot, petit verdot and cabernet franc. Better in a year or two. This delivers a pure beam of cassis, plum purée and anise notes, offering a flash of sweet spice on the finish. Moderately toasty, with a very polished mouthfeel. Crowd pleaser. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Drink now through 2030. Trevor Durling blends this wine from five Bordeaux varieties, focused on parcels of cabernet sauvignon and merlot on the Rutherford benchlands, with contributions including Coombsville and Carneros. He takes a detour to Howell Mountain for cabernet franc before returning to Beaulieu’s estate vineyards in Rutherford for petit verdot and malbec. It comes together in a savory wine with delicate flavor complexity and gentle Rutherford grandeur. There’s something a little salty and sweaty in it that brings to mind cilantro, pointing the wine toward carne asada with salsa fresca. This is a blend of all five major Bordeaux red varieties, leading with 78% Cabernet Sauvignon. Licorice, toasted oak and black plum and berry wrap around intense structure and rounded richness, finishing in tobacco and plum. The 2018 Reserve Tapestry Proprietary Red Wine is blended of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot, 5% Malbec and 1% Cabernet Franc. Deep garnet-purple in color, it bursts with open-knit notes of black cherry preserves, warm cassis and redcurrants, plus hints of forest floor, clove oil and Ceylon tea, with a waft of wild sage. The full-bodied palate has a soft texture of ripe, fine-grained tannins and lovely freshness, finishing savory. "
247,VillaViva Cotes de Thau Rose,2021,Rosé,France,22,12.5,4.3,63,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 VillaViva Rosé is intense and pleasing on the palate with a racy finish.

248,Ruinart Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,France,109,12.5,4.6,131,"A gorgeous rosé in a rich, vinous style, this shows a satiny mousse and well-honed acidity, which buoy a detailed range of macerated raspberry fruit, dried apricot, grated ginger, graphite and chopped roasted almond flavors. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay This blends chardonnay (45 percent) and pinot noir (55 percent, of which 19 percent was vinified as red wine). They come together in a lasting essence of roses and wild strawberries, the wine’s fruit complexity amplified by the sensation of acidity, with its fine limestone abrasion. A clean, simple beauty from Champagne. A blend of 55% Pinot Noir and 45% Chardonnay, and featuring around 25% reserve wines, this is 100% premier cru fruit from the Montagne des Reims and Côte des Blancs. Almost a third of the Pinot Noir was vinified as a still wine. A deep coral colour, this is fresh and youthful, with rounded wild red berry fruit, and hint of rose. With some time in the glass, it develops deeper, complex, more exotic notes, leading to a long and lively finish. Dosage: 8g/L. Rather dark-colored with cherry, watermelon and stone undertones. Full-bodied and layered, with iron and strawberry at the end. Drink now. "
249,Sine Qua Non Grenache Testa dei Cherubini,2014,Grenache,California,549,16,0.0,0,"As with the extended aged Syrah release, the 2014 Grenache Testa Dei Cherubini (80% Grenache, 15.5% Syrah, and the rest Petite Sirah and Viognier) comes all from the estate Eleven Confessions Vineyard in the Sta. Rita Hills and spent just under 38 months in 25% new French oak, with the balance in neutral barrels (varying sizes). Layers of black raspberry, cassis, white chocolate, white flowers, and Asian spices flow to a full-bodied, supple, powerful Grenache that has silky, silky tannins, a seamless texture, no hard edges, and a finish that won’t quit. It’s already approachable, yet in my experience, this extended élevage results in a very stable wine, and I suspect this beauty will have another two decades of longevity. The 2014 Grenache Testa dei Cherubini saw fully 37.5 months in wood, some 25% new, but its influence is imperceptible; the wine is strikingly pure and vibrant. Krankl commented that the longer the wines spend in barrel, the more slowly they seem to evolve in bottle. Unfurling in the glass with aromas of juicy red cherries, peonies and plums, it's initially quite reserved, becoming more expressive with air. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, layered and very concentrated, with strikingly fine-grained, revolved tannins, juicy acids and impressive length and depth. Like the 2015 Le Chemin Vers l'Hérésie also reviewed in this report, it's remarkably pure and integrated and ranks as one of the finest Grenache bottlings I've tasted from Sine Qua Non. It's also one wine that will clearly benefit from bottle age, no matter how tempting it may be when it's released in November of this year. "

251,Casa Emma Vignalparco Chianti Classico Riserva,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,35,14,3.9,29,"An extrovert but elegant Tuscan red, this shows baking spices, dark cherries and plums, cedar, dried peppers and meaty undertones. Full-bodied and nicely structured on the palate, it expertly weaves a fine line between richness, spiciness and freshness. Drink from 2021 The fruit comes from a two-hectare site called Vignalparco that is unique because ducks run free between the vines, doing an excellent job of fertilizing and hopefully eating any pests. (Yes, ducks can eat grapes, but rarely off of the vines.) The resulting 2016 Chianti Classico Riserva Vignalparco (with 11,000 bottles made) is a compact and solid wine with a very pretty bouquet composed of black fruit elements, spice and wild rose. There is smoke, tar and road paving at the end. There is a bright point of acidity on the close, making it a terrific candidate for (dare I suggest it?) a classic Tuscan pappardelle all'anatra, or pappardelle with fatty duck. Sorry. A solid backbone of tannins provides the backdrop for this lightly chewy red. Cherry, iron, tobacco and earth flavors are knotted together with the firm structure. A dusty feel lingers. Best from 2022 through 2036. Earthy and structured, this has aromas suggesting forest floor, new leather and ripe berry. The juicy, solidly built palate offers black cherry extract, licorice and coffee bean framed against assertive, rather grainy tannins. It closes on a note of rusty nail. Drink 2021–2031. "
252,Chateau Lynch-Bages (Futures Pre-Sale),2020,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,134,13.4,0.0,0,"A beautifully layered red with blackcurrant, hazelnut and lead-pencil character and fine, velvety tannins. Full-bodied and reserved. It’s like a tightly knit ball of polished tannins that are cashmere in texture. So very long and impressive. Give this time. A terrific Lynch. Best after 2027. Gorgeous from the start, with cassis and violet notes leading off, followed by additional waves of black cherry and blackberry fruit as well as sweet tobacco and iron. Shows subtle savory and cedar hints that stay in the background, as the iron note pierces through the fruit on the finish. Almost approachable for the fruit, but wait if you can. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. "
253,Ridge Pagani Ranch Zinfandel,2020,Zinfandel,California,41,13.8,0.0,0,"Potent and brooding, with deep black raspberry and currant flavors highlighted by spice box, green peppercorn and herbes de Provence notes that build toward broad-shouldered tannins. "
254,Von Strasser Reserve Red Wine,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,135,14.2,3.9,5,"Rudy von Strasser’s Reserve is an unusual blend of equal parts cabernet sauvignon and petit verdot, with 20 percent malbec and merlot. Petit verdot requires the right conditions to ripen and is usually used only in small amounts as a blending grape for its color and tannins. Here, those muscular tannins are in full force, wrestling the rich cherry and black licorice flavors to the ground so you’re left breathing earth. Wildly powerful, austere in its structure and bitter red spice, this is tight and youthfully closed, needing years to mellow. "
255,Sena,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,Chile,150,13.5,4.3,18,"The 2019 Seña was produced with a Bordeaux blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Malbec, 15% Carmenere and 4% Petit Verdot with the Chilean character of the high percentage of Carmenere. Most of the volume fermented in stainless steel with some 10% in concrete vats, and the final blend matured for 22 months in French oak barrels, 80% of them new, and 10% in Stockinger vats. It's 13.5% alcohol and has good acidity and freshness, coming through as medium-bodied, elegant and balanced. This is incredibly elegant, subtle and harmonious even at this early stage. It has floral aromas, notes of orange peel, a touch of creamy sweet spices and great freshness. The palate is medium-bodied, seamless and pure, with pungent flavors and a soft texture. It's long, clean, defined and super tasty. I feel this wine is getting better and better by the vintage. The grapes were picked quite early, and that helped to contain the ripeness and seems to have been a great decision. There was also an exception in the Panquehue zone where the Seña vines are, where the summer was cooler than the average, so quite different to many other regions in Chile. Such beautiful aromas of crushed berries, currants, walnuts, allspice and nutmeg follow through to a full body with tight, ultra fine tannins that provide length and intensity. A finish of slightly dried cherries with wet earth, slate and stone. Chewy and fine-grained. A wine with soul and length. Give it time. Drink after 2025. The twenty-fifth vintage of a wine first made in 1995 by the Mondavi and Chadwick families is one of Francisco Baettig’s best editions yet: 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Malbec, 15% Carmenere and Petit Verdot aged for 22 months in French oak (10% in foudres). The nose offers redcurrant, blackberry, and cherry over a bed of sweet spices, cedar and peppers. Dense core and firm grip, it needs to be decanted or left in the bottle for a while longer. The 2019 Seña 25 Años is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Malbec, 15% Carménère and 4% Petit Verdot from Aconcagua Costa. The wine was aged for 22 months, 10% in foudres and the rest in French barrels. A vivid purple in hue, the complex, subtle nose opens up gradually, delivering layer after layer of blackcurrants. Touches of sweet and sour cherry, a twist of raspberry, sweet spices and notes from the aging process, such as nutmeg and cedar, fill the palate. Relaxed in the mouth, the 2019 Seña begins with a juicy, well-integrated freshness that feels light as silk, accompanied by extremely finely grained yet young tannins that sculpt the flow, promising excellent aging potential. The finish lingers long, repeating aromas of blackcurrant and sour cherry. Boasts vibrant red cherry and berry flavors, which are well-knit and bear a minerally richness. The juicy finish features accents of dried green herbs and is supported by engaging tannins. Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Carmenère and Petit Verdot.

This sensational effort came in at 12.7% natural alcohol, it is made in the style of one of this estate’s great classics, the 1959. Composed of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it exhibits a dense ruby/purple color to the rim along with a luxurious bouquet of cedarwood, lead pencil shaving, white chocolate, cocoa and cassis. Fat, rich, opulent and full-bodied with low acidity and stunning seductiveness and complexity, this noble wine possesses a bountiful, generous, heady style. It is just coming into its plateau of maturity where it should hold for 20-25 years. This is one of the candidates for the wine of the vintage – make no mistake about that. Spicy and rich, with a tobacco and berry character on the nose and palate I love the nose. Full bodied, with soft velvety tannins that give you so much. This goes on and on. Sexy and exciting. This is a splendid wine. Yes, it is more powerful than the usual aristocratic Lafites, but it still manages to retain a special air of great elegance and presence. The fruits are black, the tannins immensely powerful, the flavors are of black figs, dates, cocoa. At the end, there is a vibrant acidity that shows through, which promises a great life for this great wine. Subtle, complex aromas of berries, licorice and currants. Full-bodied, with well-integrated tannins and a long finish. Very well-integrated wine. Lovely stuff. Wonderful length and finesse. "
257,Louis Latour Chambertin Cuvee Heritiers Grand Cru,2012,Pinot Noir,France,309,13.5,0.0,0,"Aged in 100% new wood, this massive wine is full of dark plum and fragrant strawberries. It is also packed with dark tannins that give the wine a dry core. The fruitiness has a strongly juicy character, fragrant with acidity and freshness. The end is a reminder that this is a powerful wine. Drink from 2020. An intense, minerally style, lean and racy, with cherry, raspberry, tobacco and kirsch flavors. Saturated, tannic and balanced, with a long, palate-staining finish. Best from 2020 through 2035. 95 cases made. A spicy, cool and airy nose only grudgingly displays its complex array of ripe violet, plum, earth and wet stone scents. The velvet-textured and mineral-driven middle weight flavors possess excellent delineation as well as focused power before culminating in a balanced, complex and palate coating finish. The supporting tannins have a very good level of phenolic maturity and overall this is a very fine Latour Chambertin. "
258,Lucien Albrecht Cremant d'Alsace,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,24,12.5,4.0,551,"COMMENTARY: The Lucien Albrecht Crémant d'Alsace is delicious and rewarding. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of fresh and ripe fruits and a touch of creaminess in the finish. Pair it with pan-seared sea scallops. (Tasted: March 24, 2022, St. Helena, CA) With its combination of lightness, creaminess and freshness, this is a good introduction to sparkling Alsace wines. And it smells like walking into a patisserie. Not exactly bone-dry, but everything fits very neatly on the palate, the mousse keeping it very lively. "
259,Chateau Fontaubert,2020,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,16,14.5,4.8,22,"COMMENTARY: The 2020 Château Fontaubert is firm, well-built, and lasting on the palate.

261,Valdicava Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,139,14.5,0.0,0,"Intense aromas of flowers and dark cherries. Perfumed and bright for the vintage. Full-bodied and firm with chewy yet polished tannins and a succulent and fruity finish that is in line and framed. The Valdicava 2017 Brunello di Montalcino shows a soft level of vintage ripeness that translates into dried strawberry or cooked cherry. These nuances are delicate and fine, however, and they are mitigated by the wine's acidity and the general clarity of the bouquet. Compared to past vintages, this 2017 is more accessible, but Valdicava has never been short on elegance or pedigree. Even that accessibility I mention is relative, because these wines have an excellent track record for longevity despite vintage variation. "
262,Massolino Barbera d'Alba,2020,Barbera,Italy,29,0,4.7,6,"The 2020 Barbera d'Alba is laced with refreshing red berry fruit, spice and floral notes. This mid-weight, silky Barbera is all pleasure and class. The gracious style is hugely appealing. This is the sort of wine that is opened and disappears in an instant. "
263,Chateau Rauzan-Segla,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,139,13.5,4.5,19,"The aromas of blackcurrants, sweet tobacco and sandalwood are tantalizing. Then it turns to subtle, dried fruit. Full-bodied with dense and powerful tannins, yet ending with finesse and vertical nature. Very deep. Power with finesse. Try after 2025. I continue to love the 2016 Rauzan-Ségla, a thrillingly complete, flawlessly balanced, and borderline perfect Margaux that should be snatched up by readers. Notes of cassis, graphite, tobacco leaf, and earth all give way to a full-bodied effort that has building tannins, no hard edges, and a level of purity and elegance that’s just about off the charts. Given its purity and balance, it’s accessible today, but it will be best with 4-5 years of bottle age and keep for 3-4 decades. Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2016 Rauzan-Ségla drifts effortlessly from the glass with fragrant rose hip tea, candied violets and chocolate box scents over a core of fresh blackcurrants and black cherry compote plus wafts of tobacco and dusty soil. Medium to full-bodied, it delivers a great mid-palate of softly textured black and blue fruits with loads of floral nuances and a refreshing lift on the finish. The blend this year is 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 2% Petit Verdot, harvested between September 20th and October 15th at an average yield of 45 hectoliters per hectare. It was aged for 18 months in French oak, 60% new. The alcohol is 13.5%. This has a lovely core of creamy anise-infused plum, blackberry and boysenberry flavors that showcase themselves a bit more vividly than many Margaux peers in this vintage do, with substantial but velvety grip and lots of extra violet, graphite and black tea notes adding to the long flow of a finish. Really beautiful feel. Best from 2023 through 2038. There's an array of flavours and complex aromatics on offer here. It's powerful and brooding, with a lyrical acidity that helps to lift up the relatively foursquare tannins on the attack. After a few minutes in the glass it begins to ripple with menthol, liquorice root, grilled cedar and sweet spices. It needs time to settle, of course, but is extremely classic, and will go the distance and then some. Matured in 60% new oak. "
264,Drappier Carte d'Or,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,49,12,4.3,156,"Disgorged in April 2021, Drappier's new NV Brut Carte d'Or delivers attractive aromas of golden orchard fruit, stone fruit, honeycomb and white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, it's charming and elegantly vinous, with a flavorful core of fruit, lively acids and a chalky finish. This has aromas of pear tart, pie crust, praline and apricot. Bright, with a creamy mousse and attractive biscuity and nutty layers. Dry feel at the end. 80% pinot noir, 15% chardonnay and 5% pinot meunier. Dosage 5,5 g/L. Unfiltered. Drink now.

265,Crossbarn Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,44,14.5,4.2,37,"Aromas of blackberries, conifer, walnuts and dried flowers follow through to a full body with firm, silky tannins and a beautiful finish. It’s linear and fine. Juicy. A new addition of Alexander Valley and Blue Mountain give this some beauty. Drink or hold. The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley) is absolutely gorgeous. Nearly half of the fruit is Paul Hobbs's new estate vineyard in Alexander Valley plus Rancho Salina on Moon Mountain. Elegant, polished and refined, the 2018 is a very beautiful wine. Sweet red cherry, crushed flowers, spice and mint add lovely shades of aromatic nuance. The Sonoma Valley Cabernet is a hidden gem in Paul Hobbs' range.   Medium to deep garnet-purple in color, the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Sonoma County leaps from the glass with notes of Morello cherries, black raspberries, redcurrant jelly and fresh blackberries plus hints of bay leaves, fallen leaves and damp soil. The medium to full-bodied palate delivers crunchy red and black fruits with a lively backbone and approachable, grainy texture, finishing with a compelling herbal lift. The vintage was sourced 50% from Sonoma's Moon Mountain AVA and 50% from a Paul Hobbs estate vineyard in Alexander Valley. "
266,Billecart-Salmon Extra Brut (1.5 Liter Magnum),2009,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,199,12,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2009 Billecart-Salmon Extra Brut is complex, generous, and drinking nicely. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits authentic aromas and flavors of earth, savory spices, and ripe apple. Pair it with linguine and clams. (Tasted: April 20, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Disgorged with two grams per liter dosage, Billecart-Salmon's 2009 Extra Brut Vintage is more giving and demonstrative than its 2008 counterpart, offering up inviting aromas of crisp stone fruit, yellow apple, brioche, honeycomb and warm pastry. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, with a pillowy mousse and a generous core of fruit girdled by bright acids, it's seamless and complete. Indeed, such is its charm and persistence that I tend to prefer it, at least for now, to the 2008. A majority of red grapes (40 percent pinot noir and 27 percent meunier) from a majority of grands crus (73 percent) make up this pan-regional blend. Vinified in stainless steel, it has main- tained freshness over the course of long aging on the lees, presenting brisk, cool flavors of lime zest, star fruit and pear. That fruit complexity lasts, while the textural pleasure brings you back for another sip. This is a big, rich wine with lots of strawberry and red-apple character. It’s full and layered with very pretty fruit. Caressing and fresh at the same time. A bit ponderous. 40% pinot noir, 27% pinot meunier and the rest chardonnay. First time with pinot meunier in the blend, helping to maintain balance in the hot 2009 vintage. Drink or hold. "
267,Blackbird Vineyards Arise Napa Valley Proprietary Red,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,58,14.6,4.1,11,"The 2018 Arise, the entry-level wine from Blackbird, is absolutely delicious. Crushed red/purplish berry fruit, mint, sage, licorice and mocha race out of the glass. Medium in body and beautifully perfumed, Arise is a terrific introduction to this lineup. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Blackbird Vineyards Arise is a full-bodied, well-packed red wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine displays aromas and flavors of black fruit and oak. Enjoy its richness with a thick, rare slice of prime rib. (Tasted: August 14, 2021, San Francisco, CA) The 2018 Arise Proprietary Red checks in as a blend of 37% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 26% Cabernet Franc, and the rest Syrah and Petit Verdot. Functioning as an entry level wine from this estate, it has impressive purity in its dark fruits, truffle, chocolate, and herbal aromas and flavors. Medium to full-bodied, nicely textured, and undeniably satisfying, I'd be happy to drink a glass any time over the coming 8-10 years or so. Best After 2021 "
268,Chateau Leoville Barton,2005,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,199,13,4.0,10,"Power and elegance merge effortlessly in this superb wine. Its pure black currant fruit is tightly coiled, supported by just the right amount of firm tannins. Great aging potential. A triumph. Delivers breathtaking aromas of blackberry, currant, licorice and flowers. Full-bodied, with a solid core of fruit and supersilky tannins. Dark chocolate, currant, berry and licorice follow through. This is racy and beautiful. Best after 2015. This offers aromas of spices, dried dark fruits, meat and berries. Full and muscular on the palate, with strong tannins and a long, long finish. This is very powerful and chewy, but a little bit tight. This is a wine for the cellar. Don’t touch this until 2018. Deep, dense and optimally ripened curranty fruit is teamed with neatly fit oak and hints of dried flowers in the sweet and very involving aromas of this lovely young Saint-Julien, and, while is arguably shows a touch of ""California"" ripeness, it is classically structured with finely fit tannins that will take time to resolve. It should be reaching its stride in five or six years, but it might not show its best face for twice that time. "
269,Chateau Haut-Brion (1.5 Liter Magnum),2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,459",14.6,0.0,0,"The 2018 Haut-Brion is composed of 49.4% Merlot, 38.7% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11.9% Cabernet Franc. Deep garnet-purple in color, the wine needs a lot of swirling before it begins to release a whole complex melody of notes, one at a time to begin: tilled earth, followed by pronounced licorice, then crushed rocks, then the preserved plums. Eventually, it all comes together into a fascinating crescendo of intense crème de cassis, rose oil, wild blueberries and kirsch notes, giving way to quiet, persistent leitmotif scents of cinnamon stick, truffles and redcurrant jelly. The medium to full-bodied palate delivers all this and more, revealing tightly wound black fruit, red berry and exotic spice layers within a solid, wonderfully plush frame and seamless freshness, finishing with epic length and loads of earth and mineral sparks. Aromas of currants, leaves, fresh mushrooms, oyster shell, tobacco, and dried flowers, following through to a full body, yet ever so refined and polished and it grows on the palate. Lovely, energetic finish. Subtle and driven at the end of the palate. Drink in 2026 and onwards. This is powerfully built. Less welcoming than La Mission at this stage but it feels like it is going to pull away increasingly as the decades pass. A serious wine, with layers upon layers of bilberry, blueberry, charcoal, fig, sage and rosemary that peel back over a good half an hour of being poured. Harvested 6 September to 2 October. Drinking Window 2030 - 2052 A quintessential expression of this terroir, the 2018 Château Haut-Brion checks in as 49.4% Merlot, 38.7% Cabernet Sauvignon and the balance Cabernet Franc brought up in a mix of new and used barrels. Ripe and sexy, yet also offering subtle aromas and flavors of blackcurrants, smoked earth, tobacco leaf, truffle, lead pencil, and minerals, it takes its time opening up but reveals a full-bodied, concentrated, multi-layered style carrying gorgeous tannins, flawless balance, and just a wonderful symmetry and elegance paired with beautiful richness. This noble, gorgeous Haut-Brion will benefit from 7-8 years of bottle age and cruise for 40 years or so. Waves of cassis, cherry puree and blackberry paste roll through in this showstopper, with notes of tea, sandalwood, iron and anise providing an entourage for the fruit. A subtle warm earth accent underscores the finish without intruding on the texture. A large-scaled yet eminently refined wine. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2025 through 2045. "
270,Aldo Conterno Barolo Bussia,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,120,14.5,0.0,0,"This is so aromatic and beautiful with cherry, berry, hazelnut and Indian spices. It’s full-bodied with firm, velvety tannins that show form and brilliance. It’s extremely long and sophisticated. Tight at the finish. Try after 2024. A chameleonlike red, with hallmark aromas and flavors of tomato sauce, cherry, macerated plum, iron and wet hay. The ripe fruit gets sweeter in this red as it builds to the vice grip of tannins on the finish, with the sweet fruit returning in the end. The Poderi Aldo Conterno 2017 Barolo Bussia shows a dark but busy quality of fruit that speaks more to the power of this hot vintage than it does the nuanced side of Nebbiolo. In this respect, the wine is quite typical of the 2017 growing season. It takes a while before the wine finds focus in the glass, but it does slowly come together to reveal broad layers of dark cherry, cassis and plum. There is some tannic tightness that leads to sour berry. A bit awkward at this young stage, it needs a few more years of cellar age to flesh out and reach balance. "
271,Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc - Viognier,2021,Other White Blends,California,16,12,4.2,140,"A bright and fresh blend of 80% chenin and 20% viognier, offering white peach and hints of candied lemon. Lightly steely with bitter-lemon notes. Just slightly off-dry. "
272,Ponzi Willamette Valley Reserve Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,Oregon,38,13.4,0.0,0,"Love the aromas of fossilized shells and sliced cooked apples. Quince and aniseed, too. Perfumed.

Full-bodied, yet firm, fresh and bright with a creamy, crunchy finish. One of the best values in Napa appellation designated reds. Drink or hold. Lush, with boysenberry, plum and blackberry compote flavors liberally laced with licorice snap and sweet spice accents. Reveals a glimmer of graphite on the finish to keep it honest. For the hedonist crowd. "
275,Seghesio Old Vine Zinfandel,2018,Zinfandel,California,40,15.4,4.1,18,"Expressive red fruit, toasted cumin and spice nose. Riper palate with gamey flavours and fruit continuing on the finish. A fine wine. Blend : 87% Zinfandel, 9% Petite Sirah, 4% Alicante Bouschet Like a briar patch in a bottle, with zesty wild berry, licorice and smoked sage flavors that build tension toward medium-grained tannins. Drink now through 2029. This is a robustly rich and ripe wine bursting in blackberry fruit, thick tannin and prominent oak. Hints of dried herb provide a complementary contrast, with 9% Petite Sirah and 4% Alicante Bouschet adding to the intensity. "
276,Forman Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,119,14.9,4.7,6,"Forman's 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon is fabulous. Rich and beautifully layered in the glass, the 2017 has gorgeous depth and a touch of exoticism that is so appealing. Ripe red berry fruit, floral overtones and a touch of spice are all laced together. Just bottled, the 2017 is super impressive, even in the early going. This is an especially racy style for Ric Forman, and yet he clearly got every ounce of potential out of the year. "

Full-bodied and structured, the youthfully tense palate features ripe red cherry, pomegranate, star anise and ground nutmeg. Tight, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity provide support and energy. It shows great aging potential. Drink 2029–2039. "
279,Ridge Monte Bello,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,249,13.7,4.2,6,"This is a very powerful Monte Bello with currants and blackberry, black licorice and smoked meat. Mint. Some sesame seed, too. It's full-bodied with incredible darkness and saltiness like volcanic salt. Umami. Grilled seaweed. Flavorful and captivating. It goes on for minutes. Best After 2025 Opens with soaring red raspberry and vivid cassis flavors. Even more precise and pure-tasting than its brother, the Estate Cabernet, Monte Bello has exquisite choreography and building on the palate. Still terribly young, has an immense structure. With time, its finish will no doubt lengthen if one can endure the agony of waiting. This is the wine that has established Ridge as a California 'First Growth'. Because of the vineyard’s cool mountain site exposed to the Pacific, Monte Bello always has a dramatic freshness—drinking it, you feel as though you’re in the mountains yourself. The first Monte Bello vines were planted in 1886, but the vineyard fell into near ruin during and post-Prohibition. A mere 3.25ha (eight acres) were replanted in 1949 and were the source of the first Monte Bello in 1962. Since then, other historic blocks have also been replanted. The 2019 is 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc. The 2019 Monte Bello is a wild, exotic wine. Huge, soaring aromatics meld into a core of heady, exotically ripe fruit. Not a shy wine by any means, the 2019 is atypically opulent, and yet all of the classic Monte Bello structure is there, underneath all of that fruit. The 2019 needs time in bottle to shed its baby fat, but there is a lot to look forward to. I imagine it will always be a pretty exuberant wine. Inky, red fruit, blood orange, expresso, sweet American oak, cedar and pipe tobacco leave a lasting impression. In a word: magnificent! COMMENTARY: Head Winemaker & COO John Olney wrote, ""During blind tastings of the 2019 Monte Bello, a record forty-one separate lots were assembled to create this vintage."" This painstaking process is just one of the reasons why this wine is so iconic. The 2019 Ridge Monte Bello is an outstanding wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of bold blackberries, other ripe fruits, and a lovely oak complement. Give it time in the cellar and pair it with a grilled, well-marbled ribeye. (Tasted: September 16, 2022, Cupertino, CA) The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Monte Bello is a more Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot, and the balance Cabernet Franc, all hitting 13.7% alcohol. As usual, it was aged in new American oak. It shows the higher Cabernet component and is deep purple-hued and tight and closed, with a primordial vibe to its dark blue and black fruit, smoked tobacco, vanilla bean, graphite, and cedarwood aromatics. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has terrific overall balance, building, ripe tannins, a good sense of freshness, and outstanding length. It reminds me slightly of the 2018 with its more elegant, streamlined profile, but I expect this to build with bottle age, and it should have 2-3 decades of overall longevity. This has a densely packed core of vivid red and black currant and mulberry fruit, which is encased for now in a mix of charcoal, cast iron, singed mesquite and apple wood. Shows terrific drive, though, and everything is in proportion, with an echo of violet hinting at some inner purity. This will just need time to unwind. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2024 through 2040. "
280,Corison Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,109,13.8,0.0,0,"A very fresh, floral-laced style, offering a bright beam of cassis and plum gelée laced with flashes of violet, hibiscus and rose petal. Nicely grounded through the finish, with alder and warm earth hints filling in. Approachable, but this has more to show in time. Best from 2023. A perfumed nose of blackberries, dark cherries, cedar, cocoa and nutmeg. Violets too. Medium body with fine tannins and bright acidity. Fresh and refined with a bright core of wild fruit and a long, flavorful finish. Drink or hold. Delicate herbal shadings accent the cassis notes on the nose of Corison's 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon. It's classic Corison, balanced and concentrated without being showy or weighty, silky in feel, with a long, lingering finish and two decades of ageability. Lots of dark, blackcurrants, cassis, darker chocolate, and hints of violets emerge from the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon, a medium to full-bodied, beautifully balanced St. Helena Napa Cabernet Sauvignon offering nicely integrated acidity, terrific balance, and a great finish. This quintessential Cathy Corison Cabernet shines on all accounts. It's going to evolve for two decades. Best After 2022 "

Ample and expressive in the glass, with tremendous nuance, the Riserva is simply exceptional in 2016. Black cherry, plum, leather, tobacco, incense, menthol and licorice bring out the darker side of Sangiovese. I would give the tannins a few years to soften. The 2016 is very clearly a special wine in the making. A harmonious texture and profile sets the stage for this red's focused cherry, currant and floral notes. Mineral and tobacco accents sneak in as this plays out on the long finish. Shows excellent structure too. Drink now through 2040. The Tenuta di Capraia 2016 Chianti Classico Riserva Capraia is tightly packed with cherry fruit, raspberry and cassis. The wine's primary aromas are lifted and bright, and the wine moves over the palate efficiently with fresh, mid-weight appeal. It serves to refresh and revive your palate during a course of Sardinian capra al profumo di alloro, or roasted goat with laurel essence. Aromas and flavors of blue fruit, wet earth and hints of slate, following through to a medium to full body and chewy tannins. Needs to soften a little. Better after 2021. Made entirely from Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of violet, tilled soil and dark-skinned berries. The savory palate offers blackberry, tobacco and black pepper alongside polished tannins and firm acidity. Enjoy through 2027. "

Self-confidently breaks the mold for this category, particularly at the very racy finish, which just doesn’t want to stop! Drink or hold. Packaged in a slender and tall bottle (with 12,000 bottles released), the 2021 Alto Adige Valle Isarco Pinot Grigio offers a tight and linear expression of this versatile grape with the high-altitude freshness and pinpoint definition that we can expect of the Valle Isarco, probably one of Italy's best-kept secrets for white wines.

286,Allegrini Amarone,2018,Other Red Blends,Italy,80,16,4.6,7,"Hattingley’s rosé is elegant, fresh and downright delicious. The color of ballerina slippers, it opens with delicate aromas of fresh strawberry, raspberry and grapefruit. They’re backed by richer ones like vanilla and baker’s yeast. The palate is wonderfully refreshing, with bubbles that prickle and bounce over the whole tongue right through to the tart red berry finish. Macerated black cherries bathed in a mixture of cloves, cinnamon, thyme and pepper waft out of the glass, inviting you to delve deeper. The silky-smooth palate is full of plums and cherries, cocoa powder and freshly ground coffee. The wine is balanced with fine tannins and enough acidity to keep the palate fresh for the next glass. "

Spices at the end. Juicy. Better in two or three years. Try after 2025. Pahlmeyer's 2019 Merlot comes mainly from the estate vineyard, with smaller proportions from the Rancho Chimiles, Broken Rock and Stagecoach Vineyards. It's all Merlot this year, with aging in barrels from Taransaud (75% new). Beautiful notes of loamy earth and mocha accent black cherries and plums on the nose, while the full-bodied palate is somewhere between velvet and silk in texture, and the lingering finish adds savory hints of cocoa and black olive.

Medium-bodied and elegantly styled, the palate is chock-full of bright, crunchy black fruit with subtle, invigorating dried herbs accents and approachable, grainy tannins, finishing with a lively lift.

309,Pietradolce Etna Rosso Vigna Barbagalli,2017,Other Red Blends,Italy,119,15,0.0,0,"This is the top red wine made by Pietradolce, and its striking black label is meant to underline its importance in the estate portfolio. The 2017 Etna Rosso Barbagalli offers a pretty garnet color and a lean to mid-weight approach. Made with fruit from pre-phylloxera vines from one of the highest elevation vineyards in the appellation (at 950 meters above sea level), this is always a study in elegance, and the integrity of the fruit transcends most problematic vintage variations thanks to the hearty resilience of the vines and their extended root systems. This wine shows composure and equilibrium with an incredibly glossy or silky quality of fruit with berry, smoke, tar and campfire ash. That old-vine concentration and power (with 15% alcohol) also comes through clearly. Layers of smoke, ash, crushed walnuts and cranberries on the nose. It’s medium-to full-bodied with sleek, tight tannins. Lots of ripe and dried red fruit on the palate with citrus peel and tobacco, too. Precise and tight finish. Lots of old-vine magic here. Barbagalli is a one-hectare amphitheatre of 80- to 100-year-old vines in Contrada Rampante on Etna's northern slopes at 950m, producing up to 2,000 bottles. It undergoes maceration on the skins for 18 days in concrete tanks, followed by 20 months in French tonneaux. It has a huge structure paired with masses of freshness characterised by a balsamic character and clean acidity. The wood has yet to integrate but it's clear that this is one of Etna's finest reds: black cherry, earth, dark berries and some dried fruit give it a sense of plushness, while the fine tannins and lively acidity give it the legs to last. Big and concentrated, this has aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, scorched soil and menthol. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, the brawny, chewy palate offers prune marinated in spirits, licorice and vanilla alongside close-grained tannins that leave a drying finish. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol. "
310,Azelia Barolo Margheria,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,110,14.5,0.0,0,"Smells like a bunch of fresh roses with strawberries and white mushrooms. It’s full-bodied with a very fine, layered palate with lightly dusty tannins. It’s extremely long and sophisticated. The 2017 Barolo Margheria is gorgeous. Open, perfumed aromatics are immediately alluring. On the palate, the 2017 is a dark, mysterious wine, with layers of flavor that continue to develop over time. Dark cherry, blood orange, spice, leather, iron and scorched earth add striking layers of nuance. The tannins are potent - we are in Serralunga after all - but the 2017 has so much to offer. It's a gorgeous Barolo to enjoy over the next two decades, maybe more. This opens with aromas of scorched earth that eventually give way to toasted hazelnut, forest floor, dried herbs and whiffs of iris. Full-bodied and elegant, the palate recalls cranberry, star anise and orange zest before an almost salty finish. Tightly knit, finegrained tannins provide support. Give it time to fully develop. The most structured and tannic of these new releases from Azelia is the 2017 Barolo Margheria. The tannins are quite present, meaning that you are required to afford generous aging time to this Barolo from Serralunga d'Alba, hoping that the fruit intensity will run the course. At this young stage, the wine shows blackberry and plum, with licorice, rusty nail and some crushed stone or terracotta clay. The wine's mineral signature is strong and elegant. In appearance, it reveals a lean and bright ruby color, and the power and natural richness of the mouthfeel come as a welcome surprise. The 2017 Barolo Margheria is herbaceous with sweet tobacco, dried black raspberry, and gentian root. The palate is drying with fast building tannins and notes of tea leaf, cherry pit, and orange pith. Tight and firmly tannic, this red's cherry, plum, eucalyptus, tar and mineral flavors are locked in for now. Though lightly astringent on the finish, this shows good balance overall. This just needs time. "

The 2016 José Zuccardi was produced with grapes (90% Malbec and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) from Altamira and Gualtallary in the Valle de Uco. This is the continuation of the old Z bottling, but here the wine is aged mostly in 2,500-liter oak vats rather than in smaller barriques. There are herbal notes reminiscent of green tea leaves, spices and berries.

It's like a touchstone. The Casanova di Neri 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova is graced with a similar interlude of elegant rose or crushed flower that we saw in the annata wine. It appears more prominently here, and with more shape and focused intensity. Make no mistake, Giacomo Neri builds wines for pleasure and sensual impact, and this wine (helped by a hot growing season and 15% alcohol) ticks all those boxes. But it also shows floral elegance and sour cherry freshness that defies our expectations of the vintage. Best after 2024. Tenuta Nuova hails from Casanova di Neri’s Le Cetine vineyard in Montalcino’s south. With a full southern exposure from east to west, it is a sun soaked, Mediterranean expression of Brunello.

TASTING NOTES: This Champagne is rich and racy. Its lively aromas and flavors of mineral notes and bright stone fruits should pair superbly with oven-roast chicken over a mix of arugula and kale. The complex bouquet reflects the primary fermentation in oak casks; the palate no less so thanks to the quality of the premier and grand cru reserves, also matured in oak. But it’s all a question of degree; there’s a core of citrussy acidity underwriting the freshness and length of the wine. 7 years on lees; disgorged December ’20, 7g/l dosage. Fermented in wood with a touch of spice and toast on the palate, this Champagne is beautifully textured and structured. The Chardonnay gives the wine a steely edge that suggests the bottling could age, so wait to drink this very fine wine from 2023. A dense Champagne with a tight and linear structure. Compressed and very pretty. Hints of nuts and cream with some pie crust. Some nougat, too. Very long and flavorful. It’s one for a meal. One third of pinot meunier, pinot noir and chardonnay.

The palate is rounded, with rich texture though dry, offering notes of orange peel and currant. It has a silky texture and a fairly long finish, with ripe concentration. It is drinking well now and should drink well. Best after 2022. Flavors of baked pineapple, chopped black cherry, grilled nut and pickled ginger expand on the palate of this expressive Champagne backed by a firm spine of integrated acidity.

The 2019 captures the warmth of the vintage, with sun-warmed raspberry and cherry, heady violets and yellow broom. Fresh and succulent, it is loaded with concentrated, joyful fruit while smooth, suede-like tannins hem it all in effortlessly. Deceptively simple sounding but in reality quite sophisticated. "
352,Cambria Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir,2020,Pinot Noir,California,25,14.1,3.8,13,"There are pleasantly herbal and seashore-like characteristics to the nose of this bottling, which offers aromas of green sage, kelp, cranberry, smoke and chiseled rock.

In fact, the wine has not been produced since 2004. Even if a vintage as good as this did come along, we'd need to wait another 13 years before we could enjoy this level of maturity and evolution. Formally a Recioto della Valpolicella, this sweet red wine is made with air-dried fruit as local tradition dictates. Luckily no botrytis set in that year, because that would have eroded the wine's deep and luscious color saturation. The bouquet delivers a generous flow of dark spice, bitter chocolate, espresso, raisin, plum, barbecue spice and teriyaki smoke. The concentration and layering of the wine are both rare and distinctive. The mouthfeel sees sweet flavors with a syrupy mouthfeel. The finish offers hints of caramelized brown sugar and savory hickory. The aging window is impossible to predict, but the wine is surely built to last. I can think of no other wine that comes close to matching this unique style. "

It’s already showing beautifully but will also offer years of fine sipping. Best After 2023 Alessandro Mori's Il Marroneto 2017 Brunello di Montalcino opens to a very distinguished and unique character that makes this wine easy to recognize in a lineup of Brunello. This hot and dry growing season made for more powerful aromas and sometimes riper flavors in the appellation, generally speaking. But this magically lean-bodied wine follows its own path, and the warmth of the summer seems to have cemented almost exotic aromas of bay leaf, crushed flower, campfire ash and iron ore. The wine is exceedingly silky and elegant, but instead of opulence, you get streamlined tension accompanied by lifted, immediate aromas of fruit, flowers and light spice. Best after 2024.  "

387,Viticcio Bolgheri,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,Italy,33,15,4.0,32,"A rich and decadent wine with incense, dark berries and black tea. Full body, integrated fruit in the mid-palate and a juicy, lightly chewy, tannin backbone. A blend of merlot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc. "

A blend of Champagne’s three classic varieties, this bottling combines fruit from the north and south of the island. Eighteen months on lees results in a bubbly that is mostly fruit driven—lemon, apple and pear—with the yeast-derived brioche notes serving as a backdrop. Crisp and linear, with lime, grapefruit and green apple flavors that are intense and refreshing. Shows plenty of focus on the finish. A fresh nose with apples, fresh citrus and preserved lemons.

With fruit from 50-year-old plants, the Le Ragnaie 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Ragnaie V. V. is one of three black-label special selections made by this estate. Instead of a Riserva program, Le Ragnaie focuses on territorial identity and single-vineyard expressions. This pretty wine shows the distinctive concentration that comes from the old vines, but that is also a result of the hot growing season. Dark fruit, rose, spice and baked clay emerge from this medium to full-bodied Brunello. Production is 3,800 bottles. Best after 2024. A sinewy version, featuring black cherry and black currant flavors enmeshed in dense, dusty tannins. Nonetheless, this is vibrant and fluid, staying focused through the long, chalky finish. Best from 2025  "
391,Foxen Bien Nacido Block Eight Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,73,13.8,0.0,0,"This is stunningly delicious, structurally complex and layered in aromas and flavors that continue to evolve. Sultry baked-black raspberry, chai cream and purple flowers invite the nose while the palate's Luxardo cherry, lilac candy, tarragon and charred meat elements achieve attention-grabbing harmony. This has a bright, acid-driven frame but also packs some punch, with a well-built core of steeped raspberry and blackberry coulis flavors laced with anise, black tea and incense notes. The long finish features serious drive and a very suave gloss of toast, which augments—rather than coats—the fruit. Drink now Pale ruby-purple, the 2018 Pinot Noir Bien Nacido Vineyard Block 8 features scents of red cherries, potpourri, iodine and leather. The medium-bodied palate has delicate fruits, a chalky texture, bright freshness and appealing Angostura-like spices defining finish. Best After 2022 "
392,Sleight Of Hand The Illusionist Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Washington,66,14.3,0.0,0,"This wine blends fruit from the winery’s Blue Mountain estate, Red Mountain Vineyard and Phinny Hill. Dark and succulent from the moment it’s poured, it feels like a drama between power and grace. There’s a substantial oak frame, and yet light aromatics effortlessly slip through that architecture—violets, pine and olive. A Blue-Mountain evergreen note carries through on the palate, a delicious counterpoint to the dark intensity of the fruit from Red Mountain and Phinny Hill. The components come together with a textural refinement that’s completely satisfying. Plum, blackcurrant and anise on the nose. Full-bodied with velvety tannins. Rich and powerful palate. Juicy black fruit and cedar come through. Rosemary, too. Very good intensity and depth. Best after 2024. Expressive and well-knit, showing a backbone of lively acidity and tannins that propel black currant, clove and forest floor accents. "

This carries to a plush, up-front, incredibly sexy 2018 with notable purity, full-bodied richness, integrated tannins, and a great, great finish. It's slightly more up-front and supple than I expected from barrel, but this incredible wine just begs to be drunk. Composed of 57% Mourvèdre, 25% Syrah and 18% Grenache, the 2018 Parvata offers up dusty fruit aromas of black cherry, blackberries and red plum skin along with a fine, powdery minerality and hints of baking spices and purple flowers that waft from the glass. Medium to full-bodied, the wine is expressive on the palate with a delicious frame of ripe fruit, overlaid with mineral tension and a firm tannic grip that is food-friendly. The wine ends with a long, drawn-out to finish that highlights the terroir. This fermented in concrete and stainless steel vessels before resting in larger French oak barrels, 25% new. "

It’s full, sweet and glorious. Lovely candied fruit at the end. Drink now. An old, mature wine, but one that has kept its ripeness and richness.

399,Conceito Contraste White,2019,Other White Blends,Portugal,25,13,4.3,23,"About one third of the wine is fermented and aged in wood. That's given it a smooth, creamy texture and delicious apple fruits. The curtain lifts lightly to bring on the acidity and the fresh aftertaste. "

Medium-to full-bodied with fine tannins and vivid acidity. Fresh and crunchy with a savory finish. Drink from 2022. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Duckhorn Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon brings excellent firmness and depth of fruit onto the palate.

410,Clos de l'Oratoire,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,44,14.1,4.3,6,"Ripe black fruit (there's some red fruit as well), tobacco leaf, damp earth, exotic flowers, and some chocolaty notes all emerge from the 2019 Clos De L'Oratoire, another beautiful wine from the Neipperg family and team. Rich, medium to full-bodied, and seamless on the palate, I love its mid-palate, it has gorgeous tannins, no hard edges, and a great finish. This is clearly a great vintage for this cuvée. Hide bottles for 4-5 years, and it's going to have 2-3 decades of longevity, and probably a gradual decline after that as well. It's beautiful. Best After 2026 Stephan von Neipperg's 2019 Clos de l'Oratoire has turned out very nicely in bottle, opening in the glass to reveal aromas of sweet wild berries, cherries, loamy soil and raw cocoa. Medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, it's broad and succulent, with lively acids, powdery tannins and a nicely defined finish. It's produced from holdings on sandy-clay soils in the northeast of Saint-Émilion. Best after 2021. Shows steeped red and black currant fruit that mingles with tobacco, worn cedar and savory notes, with a streak of warm cast iron through the finish. Slightly rustic in feel but has character and range, with good energy throughout. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2023. "

413,Continuum (375ML half-bottle),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,149,14.7,0.0,0,"Blackberries, dark wet soil and blackcurrants. Graphite, too. So aromatic. Pure fruit. Full-bodied with superbly polished, fine tannins that draw you down through the center of palate. Extremely layered and the texture is so curated, giving wonderful persistence. Real plushness and fine, velvety texture. 50% cabernet sauvignon, 37% cabernet franc, 7% petit verdot and 6% merlot. Better after 2026. Continuum's 2019 Proprietary Red is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Cabernet Franc, 7% Petit Verdot and 6% Merlot, all from the estate vineyard on Pritchard Hill. Aged in two-thirds new French oak, with the balance in second or third-use barrels and a single concrete amphora, it's remarkably dark in hue, a deep, saturated purple in the glass. On the nose, it's floral and herbal yet fruit-driven, with violets, sage and bay leaf adding nuance to black cherries, while the palate is full-bodied, plush and silky. There's an enticing yin-yang to the interplay between high-toned herbals and bass notes of dark chocolate in this dense, concentrated effort that finishes lush and long. It's a magnificent wine that should drink well for at least two decades. From the mighty estate site on Pritchard Hill, this robustly muscular wine consists of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Cabernet Franc (the highest amount ever), 7% Petit Verdot and 6% Merlot. Herbal, it shows notes of violet, graphite and tobacco alongside layers of rich red and black currant. The tannins are substantial and grippy, not quite ready to play nice on the palate. Lay this one down and enjoy it best 2029. "
414,Bodegas Juan Gil Juan Gil,2019,Mourvedre,Spain,15,15,4.0,64,"The 2019 Juan Gil (silver label) was produced with Monastrell grapes from their own old, non-irrigated vines fermented in stainless steel and matured in French oak barrels for around 12 months. It has 15% alcohol and a pH of 3.67, but somehow the wine does not come through as overripe; they eliminate all the raisins with their new optical sorting machine and that makes very clean wines and has increased the precision. They also reduced the toast of their barrels and that increases the integration of the oak with the fruit. Varietal, juicy, soft and very drinkable. "
415,Andre Robert Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut,Nature,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,79,12,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The André Robert Champagne Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut Nature dazzles the palate with its pinpoint balance and refined style. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with excellent aromas and flavors of tart apples and bright citrus. Pair it with Hamachi and Haas avocado handrolls. (Tasted: September 15, 2021, San Francisco, CA) The NV Brut Nature Les Jardins du Mesnil was disgorged in February 2021.

"
416,Roger Sabon Chateauneuf-du-Pape Reserve,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,54,14.5,0.0,0,"A dense, powerful red, with a vein of graphite coursing through sappy black fruit and melted licorice. Shows charred sandalwood and a bitter kick of herbs and iodine that offset the ripeness, with tannic grip through the smoky finish. Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. The 2020 Châteauneuf Du Pape Réserve is a similar blend of 80% Grenache and 10% each of Syrah and Mourvedre. Its deep ruby/plum hue is followed by notes of darker berries, chocolate, roasted herbs, and garrigue. Full-bodied, round, and opulent, with the vintage’s forward, incredibly charming style, it has the mid-palate depth as well as tannic structure to keep for 10-15 years, although I see no need to delay gratification. "
417,Le Potazzine Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,109,14,0.0,0,"Aromas of crushed mint, pressed rose and perfumed berry mingle with warm spice in this dazzling red. Thanks to some of the highest vineyard altitudes in the denomination, it boasts vibrancy and finesse in its flavors of ripe black cherry, juicy blood orange, licorice and crushed mint. Taut, elegant tannins and fresh acidity keep it balanced and focused. Drink 2025–2032. The ladies of Le Potazzine make a terrific bottle of Brunello, and their high-elevation vineyards are especially important in maintaining freshness in a scorching-hot vintage such as this. The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino offers a pretty succession of wild berry, cherry and plum aromas, along with light spice, crushed flowers and perfumed potting soil. This wine is also distinguished by a touch of bay leaf and maybe a warmer note of cured tobacco as well. This is an impressive effort (with 16,000 bottles released). Le Potazzine is run by Gigliola Giannetti and her daughters Viola and Sofia. Viola started taking over winemaking responsibilities in 2017 at the age of 24. She continues with the estate’s long-established approach of spontaneous fermentations in open top vats, lengthy macerations, no filtering and low SO2. I always find the wines a bit wild at first before an intense purity comes through. The 2017 reveals balsamic notes of sun-dried thyme and herb flowers before floral accents take over. It's a relatively powerful expression for Le Potazzine but ultimately expresses the property’s signature elegance. Grainy, sandy tannins wrap around ripe strawberry fruit, leading to a lingering finish of potpourri and orange. Blackberry, black-cherry and mushroom aromas. The palate is full-bodied with slightly chewy tannins, but it remains polished and lively. Berry, earth and bark in the finish. Give this a couple of years to open up. Try after 2023. Lively, offering cherry, strawberry, plum, earth and wild herb aromas and flavors. A dense array of tannins provides support, leaving a burly impression on the finish. Fine balanced and length.  "
418,Avaline Red,Blend,Rhone Red Blends,France,24,14.5,3.8,292,"This delicious blend of Grenache and Syrah from actor Cameron Diaz and partner Katherine Power offers accessibility and freshness prime for food pairing. Joined by Old World acidity and a zing of spiced black cherry, a sprinkling of white-peppered earthiness brings a fine sapidity to the palate. A hint of brown sugar and cinnamon keeps it intriguing. "
419,Prunotto Barbaresco,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,44,14,4.0,15,"A silky red, this is woven with macerated cherry and berry flavors, accented by tar and a hint of white pepper. Open and approachable, with fine balance and length. Drink now. "
420,Chateau Meyney,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,33,14.5,4.3,16,"Blueberry, blackcurrant, clove, dark chocolate, praline and gravel on the nose. It’s full-bodied with firm, fine-grained tannins. Focused, chewy and layered. Fantastic effort here. Try from 2025. It's clear that this is hugely concentrated, as is the Montrose right next door, but there's also beautiful juice and freshness underneath the black fruits and the powerful grip. Tannins, acidity and fruit: it's all there. This is great quality and should be long-lived, with a rich palate, evenly balanced and austere in all the right places. Another good vintage at this increasingly impressive property. "
421,Ridge Lytton Estate Petite Sirah,2019,Petite Sirah,California,41,0,3.9,5,"Looking at the 2019s, the 2019 Petite Sirah Lytton Estate is a beauty, offering a plump, fruit-forward, yet concentrated style carrying ample darker black fruits, chocolate, chalky minerality, and roasted herb-like aromas and flavors. It’s a big mouthful of a Petite Sirah that stays balanced and has good freshness and notable structure. "
422,Soter Vineyards Planet Oregon Pinot Noir,2021,Pinot Noir,Oregon,25,13.5,3.6,21,"The 2021 Pinot Noir Planet Oregon is ripe with sweet aromatics of raspberry liqueur, moss-covered earth, and sweet herbs.

This takes a turn toward the savory spectrum on the palate, as zesty acids and salty minerals enliven the tart wild berry fruits within. Violet florals resonate through the finale, along with hints of sour citrus that maintain lively freshness. "
428,Diamond Creek Volcanic Hill Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,249,14,4.8,8,"Beautiful aromas of brambleberries and blueberries with some conifer and mushrooms. Floral, too. Medium to full body, very fine tannins and succulent fruit and spices. Extremely long and subtle. Glorious and refined now, but will be better with age. Try after 2022. The 2017 Volcanic Hill starts out on a woodsy, less-immediately fruity note on the nose, but, while it takes a few minutes to show it, it is well-endowed with the deep, very precise, cassis-like fruit of top-shelf Cabernet Sauvignon and unequivocally confirms it with its building, impressively extracted flavors. Most definitely not a wine that should be opened and poured before seven to ten years have passed, it is yet another classic from Diamond Creek that is destined to reach its twentieth anniversary with life and layered richness to spare. This 2017 Volcanic Hill is one of the sexiest cabernets I’ve tasted from California. To mitigate the possible smoke taint, Steinschriber bathed the grapes in a one-ton fermenter, then rinsed them in a half-ton bin with drainage holes in the bottom. This vintage of Volcanic Hill seemed a little beyond his control, but its wildness only adds to the irresistible beauty of the wine, maybe because the normally fierce tannins were tamed to the kind of rocky wild-blueberry skin richness that takes a Diamond Mountain wine into the pleasure sphere, both sensual and intellectual, of first-growth Bordeaux. Bold, featuring dark plum, fig and blackberry compote flavors that jump to the fore, quickly harnessed by singed juniper, warm earth and licorice root notes. Shows good grip for a 2017. Best from 2022 through 2040. "
429,Jean-Louis Chave Hermitage Blanc,2019,Rhone White Blends,France,345,0,0.0,0,"Another incredible white from this family is the 2019 Hermitage Blanc, a powerful, concentrated, and remarkably pure Hermitage that has laser-like focus as well as textbook Marsanne notes of quince, green almond, powdered rock, licorice, and spice. It’s still tight, focused, and inward at present, yet it reminds me of the 2018 with its purity and rare mix of power and elegance. It’s worth trying a bottle any time over the coming 3-5 years, but after that, I’d recommend waiting until after 2031. A tasting of barrel samples of different lieux-dits: Les Rocoules, Péléat and Ermite paint a picture of an exceptionally rich and opulent white Hermitage, with great textural generosity and fat, relatively low acidity and fairly high alcohol. The main problem was the speed with which the grapes were taking on sugar at the end of the season, so all the whites were picked in just two days (normally it takes five days), including a Sunday - only the second time they have done this, the previous time due to rot. An atypically large-framed vintage, that will provide plenty of succulent, rich pleasure over the years. Chave's 2019 Hermitage Blanc delivers just the merest hint of toasted grain on the nose, accenting green peaches and waves of honeyed richness. It's full-bodied and concentrated but not overdone, with tremendous length and a hint of bitterness on the finish that left me wondering if this wine will need 20 years to show its best, or if it was still suffering a bit from being bottled in July 2021. "
430,E. Pira e Figli Barolo Mosconi,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,144,14.5,0.0,0,"Chiara Boschis has recently purchased more vineyards in the Mosconi cru located at a cool 370 meters in elevation in Monforte d'Alba. Sourcing its fruit from an organic 1.9-hectare parcel, the 2018 Barolo Mosconi is available in a slightly larger production of 9,000 bottles. This is terrific news for those who love the focus and precision that Chiara Boschis is known for. The Mosconi carries generous fruit weight and volume over a streamlined mouthfeel and tight tannins. The wine ends with fresh notes of blackberry, plum and wild rose. This red puts it all together—macerated cherry and plum fruit, a silky texture, vibrant structure and elegance—without sacrificing power or harmony. Complex and long, with a haunting finish that provides rose, menthol, licorice and iron accents. Best from 2025 This Mosconi from Chiara Boschis comes from a calcareous marl soil at almost 400 metres above sea level. The wine is quite a dense ruby colour in the glass, with restrained forest floor scents and whiffs of rosemary, chocolate and wild red fruits. Filigreed and complex, the palate has a delicate attack, firm tannins and good density, with flavours of tar and plenty of violet and pomegranate. Biting and still austere but softened by the French barriques - where the wine ages for two years - it's not ready to drink now yet will evolve nicely. Plenty of tense, wild-strawberry character to this with bright minerals, too. Medium-bodied with a punchy core of bright fruit, tight tannins and a tense, crystalline finish. From organically grown grapes. Needs time to even out. Best from 2024. "

432,Hacienda Monasterio Ribera del Duero,2018,Tempranillo,Spain,51,0,4.6,8,"The 2018 Hacienda Monasterio, the wine that was previously labeled as Crianza, is a blend of 80% Tinto Fino, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot and 2% Malbec selected from the 100 hectares of their organically certified vineyard in the west part of Ribera del Duero. It had a traditional fermentation, destemmed and in 8,000-liter stainless steel tanks (a change from the 20,000-liter vats used in 2016) with indigenous yeasts, and it matured for 18 months in French oak barrels, 25% new. This wine represents the character of the property, including all the grapes. It's still a little young, with a creamy twist, a little biscuity with hints of cereals, juicy and with tannins but with balance. This is a vintage that has great balance and freshness, but right now it's a little too oaky for me—but it should develop nicely in bottle. They are now in the process of replacing the Merlot with Malbec, because they think Malbec can work well in the Ribera del Duero. "
433,Vineyard 29 Ceanda Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,150,14.7,0.0,0,"Another St. Helena release, the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Ceanda checks in as 90% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, and the rest Petit Verdot and Merlot, all brought up in French oak. Black fruits, chocolaty herbs, graphite, violets, and acacia flower notes all emerge from the glass, and it hits the palate with a seamless, elegant texture, ultra-fine tannins, no hard edges, and a great finish. I'd be thrilled to drink a bottle any time over the coming 20 years or more. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Vineyard 29 Ceanda Cabernet Sauvignon is outstanding from start to finish. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of black fruits, oak, dried tree branches, and violets. Pair it with rosemary-infused, grilled beef kebabs.

Deep garnet-purple in color, it delivers expressive notions of blackberry pie, Black Forest cake and crème de cassis with hints of licorice, tar and Sichuan pepper plus a waft of wild sage. Full-bodied, the palate has a rock-solid, rugged structure of grainy tannins and plenty of freshness to support the black fruit preserves layers, finishing on a lingering aniseed note. "
434,Joseph Drouhin Meursault,2020,Chardonnay,France,88,0,0.0,0,"A classically structured wine for this appellation with the weight and round generosity that we expect from it, but with plenty of bright citrus and pear fruit, something these wines can lack a bit of. Good depth with an excellent integration of chalky minerality and healthy acidity at the long and delicate finish. With aeration a touch of vanilla bean develops on the nose. Drink or hold. "

Black cherries and blueberries mingle easily on the nose, joined by hints of maple syrup and licorice. Full-bodied, velvety and super-ripe, it comes across as almost sweet on the lingering finish. Personally, I'd serve it late in the meal, perhaps alongside a well-aged Parmiggiano or similar cheese. Aromas of ripe blueberries, cassis, mint leaves, rosemary and licorice.

In 2018, it doesn’t disappoint: The first three words in my notes are tobacco, sundried tomato and plum, words which describe great wines of Seven Hills, and a great many Walla Walla reds, the coolness of herb bathed in dark red fruit, warm, dense, tannic, powerful, classic, winking at France, glancing at California, wholly its own self. Notes of blackberries and dark plums with cedar and earthy undertones. It’s full-bodied with firm tannins. Full and juicy with structure and good balance. Long, supple finish. The 2018 Perigee Seven Hills Vineyard Estate is a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Franc, 9% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec. The nose is instantly impressive with elements of French oak and baking spices that waft with dusty and juicy dark fruit tones. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is silky, displaying fine-grained tannins with a juicy essence of black raspberry, dark cherry and bitter dark chocolate before showcasing flavors of vanilla bean and blackberry skin. It ends with a long-lingering finish that continues to evolve with persistence in the mouth. It's an absolutely delightful wine that delivers well for the price. It was fermented in small French barrels, 40% new, and allowed to rest for 22 months before bottling. Appealing for its focus and structure, this blend offers handsome blackberry, lead pencil and black tea flavors that build tension toward medium-grained tannins. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Reserved aromas of licorice, plum, chocolate, cherry and spice are followed by enveloping dark-fruit flavors. It brings a lot of midpalate density that ups the appeal. Ripe nose of red fruit, dark plum, with baking spices and menthol notes. Deep, concentrated palate with luscious taste. Some luxury here.

Based on 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah, and the rest a mix of permitted varieties, it has stunning aromatics of red and black fruits, roasted garrigue, spring flowers, and a hint of graphite. With full-bodied richness, moderate acidity, ripe, velvety tannins, and one heck of a great finish, it’s one of the gems in the vintage. Dark and brooding, this reveals layers of black fruit edged in iron and smoke. Tightly coiled on the palate, with highlights of violet, tea, forest floor and cumin emerging with time. Slightly grippy tannins hold firm, and this will benefit from a few years in the cellar for the full range of flavors to open up. Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre, Counoise and Vaccarèse. Plentiful brooding dark fruits, this is bold, rounded and powerful. Riper and deeper than many this year, with massy ripe tannins. The alcohol does seem a little high, but the acidity is balanced and it finishes long and intense. Grown on mixed soils, mostly galets roulés and sand, in the lieux-dits of Les Brusquières and Cabrières. Fermented half in stainless steel, half in concrete tanks, then aged in large barrels of different shapes and sizes. "

It’s full-bodied with creamy tannins and a round, caressing finish. Lovely focus and intensity, though dense and layered. Extremely creamy and polished. Really precise and bespoke. It already opens beautifully on the palate. Drink after 2025. A beautiful Canon that performs the 360-degree trick in your mouth of expanding up, down and out. Of course a little austere right now at this young age, but already walking the tightrope towards richness; the creaminess in the texture becomes clear after 20 minutes in the glass. This has salinity, purity, precision and grip, showing its distinct personality and its ability to draw juice and mouthwatering expression from the fruits. Drinking Window 2026 - 2048 The Grand Vin is the 2018 Château Canon, which is based on 72% Merlot and 28% Cabernet Franc brought up in 52% new French oak. Its incredible bouquet delivers richness paired with amazing freshness and precision, offering loads of crème de cassis and darker berry fruits intermixed with classic Saint-Emilion chalky minerality, graphite, scorched earth, and spring flowers. Gorgeous on the palate as well, with medium to full-bodied richness, ultra-fine tannins, flawless balance, and again, this wonderful sense of freshness paired with ample richness, it needs 4-5 years of bottle age and will evolve for 30+ years. The 2009 and 2015 are still my favorite vintages of this wine, but this is up there with the best of them. Ripe and focused, with a core of plum, black cherry and raspberry compote notes that are still a bit coiled up, though inlaid with a racy chalky spine and notes of black tea and tobacco that should all meld as it stretches out in the cellar. A restrained, refined, lengthy wine that drips with class. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2024 through 2038. "

The quality of the tannins is fantastic in this 2017. Drink after 2023. Le Lucére is a single vineyard of 3.5ha planted in 1996 below Salvioni and La Cerbaiona in Montalcino and producing about 13,000 bottles annually. Gentle fruit handling and a short maceration contribute to the graceful style of this Brunello. It ages in a combination of big oak casks and small barrels for a total of two years. What, in my opinion, could explain the exceptional freshness and the unwavering elegance of this Brunello is the eastern exposure of the vineyard on the northern side of the village. The dried cherry fruit is lifted with thyme and blood orange, a touch of wax and deep hints of smoky woodland. The palate is dense and velvety, with greatly refined tannins and predominantly floral flavours. Organic. There is a tension between the strawberry and cherry fruit flavors in this red, which has a savory side, evoking wild Mediterranean herbs, tobacco and eucalyptus flavors. Dense, burly tannins underline it all and the finish is long and satisfying. Best from 2025 "

Dusty crushed stones, too. Sharp and precise, with a medium body and mouthwatering acidity. This is very fruity and dense, with a column of fruit that goes deep in to the wine.  2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the Julius Riesling, and what a vintage to be able to commemorate. 2022 was blisteringly good, seemingly everywhere in South Australia (and Western Australia too), and that was never more true than for Riesling. Here, in the 2022 Julius Riesling, the tension and savory precision that marks Julius is out in full force; the wine this year is littered with preserved lemon, brine, pith and crushed shells (odd, sure, given the non-proximity to ocean!) and, more interesting, leafy things too, like green tea and orchard leaves. Kaffir lime, also? Excellent. "

Long and expansive, it's more generous and gourmand than its racier 2014 predecessor, but just as good. COMMENTARY: The 2015 Champagne Louis Roederer Champagne Rosé shows excellent style and complexity, with a nice bite in the aftertaste. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of fragrant strawberries, a touch of yeastiness, and a faint chalky note. Pair it with grilled, wild-caught salmon. (Tasted: August 2, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Pure and pretty notes of wild strawberry and nectarine fruit are enriched by hints of marzipan, chalk and pickled ginger in this graceful rosé Champagne.

Svelte and richly spiced, with plush, concentrated flavors of dark fruit and berries swathed with ripe acidity. Loamy hints to the Asian spice accents, with lots of chocolaty nuances on the finish. The 2019 Pinot Noir Wayfarer Vineyard is one of the more approachable Pinots in the lineup, yet smart money will still give bottles a handful of years in the cellar. Spiced cherries, mulberries, spicy oak, violets, and orange blossom all define the aromatics, and it's medium-bodied, with a round, expansive texture, more velvety tannins, and a great finish. "

You have to squint to see it, but there’s just the slightest of pink hues to Jansz’s latest Premium Rosé. The nose leads with a combo of toasty hazelnut, dried fig, lemon verbena, orange zest and dried lavender aromas. The palate, while a little lacking in depth of flavor and length, comes with fresh, vigorous bubbles and a chalky texture. A solid drop from one of Tasmania’s best-known producers. This offers attractive red berries and strawberry pastry, as well as some peach and melon notes. The palate has a supple, fresh delivery of quite deeply flavorful strawberries with a soft, gently creamy edge to the finish.

This is an especially extroverted Cabernet done in a style that turns the volume up to eleven, or more. The 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon from Hewitt does well in the vintage and has a classic, elegant, satisfying style. Lots of red and black currants, tobacco, cigar box, and cedar notes emerge from the glass, and it’s medium to full-bodied, with a balanced, understated profile, moderate yet firm tannins, and outstanding length.

There are aromatics of black raspberry, licorice, menthol, sage, cinnamon, and iron-rich earth. Its Mediterranean influence is felt on the palate with ripe black cherry, dried herbs, and sun-baked earth. This is the fullest bodied and most savory of the Val di Suga lineup, with more roundness and grip. Its structure will benefit from cellaring for several years and will be great drinking over the next 20 years or more. 2026-2040. Dried leaves and roots, bark, walnut husks and black olives.

The palate is medium-bodied, silky and perfumed with lightly chalky tannins and seamless freshness on the long, spicy finish. Inviting red fruit and a sharpness of orange peel open the way to a juicy and supple midpalate of robust richness and weight that works well within the integrated tannin and oak. With underlying acidity, it remains fresh on the palate within its hearty fruit and layered texture. Well-structured, with concentrated red fruit and berry flavors, supported by a vibrant lattice of acidity and tannins. Minerally midpalate, featuring savory richness that extends on the vibrantly spiced finish. Drink now through 2025. This wine’s bold, succulent black-cherry flavor has the energy to override its oak aging, layering that tight fruit ripeness over sweet touches of caramel and almond. This is clean and spicy in its flavor detail, its acidity gentled by supple sweetness even as it keeps moving the flavors forward. Delicious with tea-smoked duck. Destemmed and aged 9 months in 35% new French oak, the 2017 Pinot Noir Sealift has a spicy, powerful bouquet of red and black fruits, pine forest, iodine, violets, and crushed rocks. This carries to a medium-bodied, juicy Pinot Noir with a firm, focused texture, ripe tannins, and a good finish.

It has a great nose of dark berry, almost blueberry-like fruits as well as ample tobacco leaf, damp earth, baking spices, and chocolaty oak. Rich, medium to full-bodied, and concentrated, it has velvety tannins, beautiful overall balance, and a great finish. It needs 2-4 years to integrate its oak (it's undeniably delicious today) and will have 15-20 years of longevity, if not longer. Best After 2024 The 2019 Bellamy is a delightful blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, with 7% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec. On the nose this takes on layers of bright dark fruits with chocolate and coffee ground accents. The palate is extremely elegant and refined, revealing layers of dark currants, kirsch and flinty undertones that mingle with good freshness and salinity.

502,Ramos Pinto 30 Year,Tawny,Port,Portugal,129,19.9,4.5,23,"The wonderful old-gold color of this tawny leads into a generous, rich wine that has retained fruits while also showing a woody character that is typical of wines this old. With spice, dried raisins and intense acidity, it is a beautiful wine that deserves to be drunk just by itself. The Ramos Pinto 30 Year Tawny Porto is all about the complexity. It just wraps its nuances of butterscotch, vanilla, hazelnut, and sweet oak onto the palate and then some. The some, in this case, is just a long, long finish that never seems to stop. Enjoy this sweet nectar with a long conversation with a good friend. (Tasted: October 27, 2016, San Francisco, CA) This sings from the glass with sweet spice, marmalade, molasses, clove, nutty, toffee, caramel and balsamic perfume. A very complex array of flavors, including roasted coffee, scorched earth, fig and walnut. A distinctive style, done very well. Highly impressive. This is alluring, with whiffs of warm date, green tea and walnut backed by juicy fig bread and salted caramel flavors. The racy, focused finish lets a singed juniper note glide through. Drink now. The NV RP 30 Year Old Tawny Port was bottled in February 2020 with a bar-top cork and 139 grams of residual sugar. Showing more complexity and notably more sweetness than the 20 Year also reviewed this issue, this is along the lines of the last release (the 2018) that I saw a while back. As it opens and the sugar blows off, especially a couple of days later, this shows off its complexity even more, but also just a touch of harshness. The key difference is really the complexity versus the freshness—in other words, about what you'd expect. The 20 Year has almost as much concentration and power as this elegant 30 Year, but the 20 Year is fresher and even more elegant (not that the 30 isn't rather fresh for its age), while the 30 Year is far more nuanced. I personally slightly preferred this, as I usually lean toward complexity, but reasonable minds might differ. “This starts with a crescendo and doesn’t stop,” said Justin Nash of NYC’s The Modern. It’s a broad-spectrum Tawny, the pleasures of its textures rolling out across the mouth and throat, the flavors delivered in layers of toasty, nutty complexity. It’s the kind of wine that will inspire conversation long into the night. "

Since its arrival into the marketplace in 2000, this wine became an instant star, albeit controversial in some quarters of the wine world because of perceived sweetness. Many of my closest wine pals also decried that the wine was too extracted. While the wine flirts a bit beyond the standard threshold residual sugar level, this wine is pretty tasty and dry in a New World way. The 2019 vintage is the wine's best effort to date, and it signals its long journey to become a wine that everyone can wrap their palate around.

It has a ripe, concentrated style yet brings plenty of tannins and has a firm, age-worthy feel. A tasting of barrels samples of various lieux-dits: Les Dardouille, Le Clos, Les Challaix, Bachasson (both higher and lower sites). The overall impression is a rich, full vintage, but by no means excessive, jammy or baked. Each site expresses its particular character with aplomb, and there is plenty of high-toned precision to the aromas, ranging from the floral and spicy to the deeply fruited. The alcohol is marginally higher than in a typical year, but not unbalanced. J.L. Chave's Saint-Joseph is lively, vibrant and rich, fresher than most 2019s. Bottled in late July 2021, Chave's 2019 Saint Joseph boasts copious floral scents of violets and lavender set against a backdrop of purple raspberries. In the mouth, it's medium to full-bodied, with a wonderfully rich yet silky feel and plenty of airy, refreshing length on the finish. It should drink well on release and for at least a decade after that. "
526,Fanti Vigne le Macchiarelle Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,2015,Sangiovese,Italy,130,15.5,0.0,0,"A polished style, with a light touch of new oak, evoking macerated cherry, strawberry, mineral, earth, wild herb and light spice flavors. Turns lean and dense, with a supporting layer of tannins on the finish. Features plenty in reserve. Best from 2025 through 2047. Purity and richness here, with beautiful depth and intensity. Dried berry, strawberry and smoke meat. It’s full-bodied with round, juicy tannins and a flavorful finish. Creamy texture. Spicy finish. Drink after 2022. The Fanti 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Vigna Le Macchiarelle stands apart from the estate's other two releases from 2016. This wine shows a heavier center of gravity for sure, with aromas of honey, ripe cherry, blackberry confit and even a touch of dried apricot. Those thicker aromas set in after the more fleeting aromas of crushed limestone and smoke lift and eventually disappear. As a result, I found these results slightly monotone compared to the buoyant and bright 2016s. This is a wine to enjoy in the medium term next to a roast game hen. Planted in 1980 by Filippo Fanti, Macchiarelle is only produced in the best vintages from the estate’s oldest vines. The nose is grounded with cedar, forest floor, dried plum, and fresh tobacco. Gentle tannins and acidity contribute to a weightless mouthfeel. This is in a great place for enjoyment now or over the next ten years. "

This is a solid, mid-weight expression and a wine that ultimately lasts long on the palate thanks to the density and quality of its texture. Best After 2024 The roses and lemon leaf come through in the nose, with a palate of cherries and plums. Medium-bodied with chewy yet fine tannins and a medium finish.

A joy to taste. This young colheita has zesty fruit clarity, its creamy loquat and fresh apricot flavors brightened by floral notes of chamomile and highlights of thyme and sage. The texture is polished, bringing all the flavor together in smooth elegance. The 2007 Colheita Tawny Port was bottled in 2018 with a long cork and 90 grams of residual sugar.

Garnacha is an important component in the 2012 Viña Ardanza Reserva, where it represents 20% of the blend (the rest is, of course, Tempranillo). 2011 was a difficult vintage for Garnacha, so Viña Ardanza was not produced that year and they jumped from 2010, which had the mention ""Selección Especial,"" to 2012, where it returns to the regular Reserva. The wine is a prototype of polished and aged Rioja with a ruby color with some orange and a developed nose with subtle aromas of decayed leaves, sweet spices and some cherries in liqueur even, quite complex and harmonious. The palate is velvety but rich, with resolved tannins and a fine chalky mouthfeel, sleek and elegant, terribly balanced. The flavors are pure and defined, and there is an overall sense of harmony that I like very much. Brilliant Ardanza! Warming, nutty, complex Rioja with layers of fruit and a softness of dark cherry fruit on the palate. Has soft tannins and is elegantly poised, with a long, savory finish. COMMENTARY: The 2012 La Rioja Alta Viña Ardanza Reserva is generous and elevated on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine shows ripe red and black fruit aromas and flavors as well as hints of black olives. Pair it with a well-seasoned, roast leg of lamb. (Tasted: June 2, 2020, San Francisco, CA) This red shows an earthy character, with loamy earth, tar and tobacco notes framing dried cherry, licorice, orange peel and forest floor flavors.

From a great terroir on the south-facing hillside just outside of the village, the 2019 Château Fonplégade has pretty notes of ripe black cherries, cassis, spring flowers, sandalwood, and classy oak. I love the nose, and while it's still young and relatively unevolved, it already has hints of complexity and nuance, and the purity is spot on. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, with a great mid-palate and sweet, velvety tannins, it already offers pleasure yet will benefit from 4-6 years of bottle age, and I'd be shocked if it didn't evolve nicely for at least 15-20 years. Best after 2026. Shows the thickly textured dark fruit of the vintage, with steeped plum and blackberry notes cruising through slowly, carried by alder, loam and tobacco threads. Gains nuance as it airs in the glass, showing light chalky minerality for energy and balance in the process. Approachable but no rush. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Drink now. Aromas of ripe cherries, licorice, crème de cassis, burning embers and loamy soil introduce the 2019 Fonplegade, a medium to full-bodied, muscular wine that's rich and powerful, reflecting its clay-rich soils. It's a fleshy, generous wine that represents a fine success in a more impactful style. Best after 2025. "

Drink this beautifully controlled Champagne now. "
540,Patz & Hall Hyde Vineyard Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,California,75,14.2,4.4,11,"Stewed black fruit fills a dense texture-packed core of tannin and pronounced oak in this exuberant wine, with moderately structured acidity lending a balanced approach. Blue fruit and a touch of vanilla meet the palate head-on, showing a lifted intensity and noticeable length. Powerful, taut and well-structured, with toasty accents to the dried raspberry and cherry tart flavors, followed by hints of cinnamon bark that linger on the minerally finish. "
541,Evodia Old Vine Garnacha,2019,Grenache,Spain,14,14.5,3.7,336,"Based on 100% Garnacha, the 2019 Evodia is a killer value that delivers incredible Garnacha flair at a crazy good price. Kirsch, blackberry, acacia flower, violet, and sandalwood notes give way to a medium to full-bodied, seamless, beautifully layered wine with fabulous tannins, no hard edges, and a great, great finish. This is the finest wine at this price point in the world. "
542,Lucien Albrecht Grand Cru Spiegel Gewurztraminer,2017,Gewurztraminer,France,41,13.9,0.0,0,"The heady richness of Damask rose settles in with the peach perfume of this wine. The palate unites these tones with fruity, rounded generosity, boosting with mellow sweetness. A pleasantly bitter note, aligned to aromatic orange peel, provides a perfect foil for the richness and makes this an exquisitely balanced wine. A very clean and lively gewurz for the warm vintage, this is an elegant and fresh wine that underplays its weight and richness, creating harmony that makes it remarkably food-friendly for this grape. COMMENTARY: The 2017 Lucien Albrecht Grand Cru Spiegel Gewurztraminer is delicate, pleasing, and focused. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of roses, savory spices, and mineral notes. Pair it with Cantonese raw fish salad. (Tasted: June 9, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "

I’m always able to taste Louis’s Northern Rhône release as well. His 2020 Condrieu is medium to full-bodied, pure, and balanced, with that unique Condrieu ability to blend richness and freshness. Some classic tangerine, white flowers, and honeysuckle notes define the nose, and it’s beautifully done. Drink it over the coming 4-6 years. Barruol does a lovely job with Condrieu, which he sources from Malleval, what he calls ""the cold corner of Condrieu."" His 2020 Condrieu features flowery, blossom-like aromas, plus subtle pear and spice shadings. It's only medium-bodied, but provides hints of Viognier's opulence, with a long, silky-textured finish that barely hints at bitterness. "

It's composed of a blend of fruit from neighborhoods across the Russian River Valley: Middle Reach, Green Valley, Laguna Ridge, Santa Rosa Plain and Sebastopol Hills. It has a nose of white peaches and lime peel with touches of toast, dark spice and roasted almonds. The palate is lush and satiny, with hedonistic, spicy fruits and fresh acidity that makes this super easy to drink. An amalgam of all their single vineyard wines, the 2020 Chardonnay Russian River Valley is fresh with green pear liquor, flint, and white flowers.

This is pure Napa Valley magic. Incredible cassis and darker berry fruits as well as smoked tobacco, graphite, and chalky minerality all define the bouquet, and it has a Château Latour-like structure and regalness on the palate.

Firm tannins offer structure as this remains on the elegant side, lingering with echoes of fruit, wild herbs and mineral. Aromas of plum, violet and tobacco are front and center along with a whiff of camphor on this fragrant, savory red. The smooth, enveloping palate has a weightless quality, featuring spiced blueberry, dried cherry and licorice framed in tightly knit but elegant tannins. "
564,Chateau Margaux Pavillon Rouge (1.5 Liter Magnum),2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,476,13.5,0.0,0,"The blackcurrant and floral aromas with brick and hot stones are tantalizing. Flowers underneath it all. Medium to full body, firm and silky tannins with beautiful ripeness that highlights the palate. Second wine of Château Margaux. Try after 2024. With its dense texture and high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is an impressively powerful second wine of Château Margaux. Acidity and dark
blueberry flavors are concentrated, with layers of tannins that demand aging. Drink from 2023. The second wine of Château Margaux is the 2016 Pavillon Rouge, a blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot, and 3% Petit Verdot brought up in 60% new barrels. It too is incredibly classic, elegant, and finesse-driven, with textbook Margaux aromatics of cassis, ripe cherries, and spring flower, medium body, subtle background oak, and lively acidity. It has real class and is capable of 2-3 decades of longevity. Very refined and focused, with fine-grained sandalwood and alder accents lining a core of stylish, gently mulled cherry and blackberry fruit flavors. A perfumed lilac note weaves around the fruit on the elegant finish. Approachable now, but buried minerality lurks, and this is sneaky long, so cellaring is easily doable. Best from 2022 through 2035. This has softened and deepened over the 18 months of ageing yet still has a touch of austerity and will take a few years to settle down. It's not as plump or generous as the 2015, but it's a beautiful wine that has balance and effortless class - a wonderfully poised Pavillon Rouge. 60% new oak has lent it some toasted almond and tarry notes. It represents just 26% of the harvest, making this the smallest ever percentage of the crop to make it into the second wine. "

Full-bodied with round, ripe tannins that are layered and fresh. A delicious combination of mature fruit and mahogany add to the complexity of the wine. Holding on really nicely. Drink or hold. This red carries dense aromas of plum, cassis and caramel, but is surprisingly bright on entry. It offers complex dark-fruit flavors up front that dissolve into notes of butterscotch, tobacco and dark chocolate. Plush tannins make their presence known right into the fruit-filled finish. Autumnal, bonfire character here: savoury, truffle, cinder toffee and dried black cherry. A classic yet rich and concentrated wine that perfectly expresses the year and region. Long on red-fruit clarity, this tastes like crushed strawberries and cranberries, with some deli-cate bitterness from the skin of the fruit. Its lacy flavors persist, a wine of grace and har-mony, tight and clean. This is not a block- buster 2010, but if you take it on its own terms, it is lovely to drink. COMMENTARY: The 2010 Faustino I Gran Reserva is complete with excellent length on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with coconut and black fruit aromas and flavors.

570,Ravines Argetsinger Vineyard Dry Riesling,2019,Riesling,U.S.,34,12.5,4.5,6,"The Argetsinger cuvée is a tour de force in this vintage, with the abundant aromas of nectarine and green apple of the 'regular' dry Riesling. Yet, the limestone soil of the mild slopes in this southeast corner of Lake Seneca shines through in the verdant and saline minerality that sets this wine apart. Piercingly lovely acidity but more than enough exuberant peachy fruit shot through with floral notes to bring this exciting wine into dynamic balance and carry it to an immensely satisfying finish. Its tightly wound structure and silky finesse ensures it should age for decades. Perhaps America's preeminent Riesling. Drinking Window: 2021 - 2031. The 2019 Dry Riesling Argetsinger Vineyard, another late release, has just two grams of sugar plus 8.7 grams of total acidity and 12.8% alcohol. The regular Dry Riesling shows so well that some might wonder why they should trade up. It's a fair question since the difference in price is over $10 in a region known for its bargains. Many will be perfectly happy stopping there. Still, I'd say this is the better wine and that will become even clearer as they both age (and likely separate a bit more). This is more impressive for expressive fruit. It seems more like the essence of Riesling, unfolding slowly over your tongue and coating the palate until some bursts of acidity crop up. Like its regular 2019 sibling, though, it is relatively integrated and balanced, with not a hair out of place. If anything, it seems more refined and graceful. The slight tart aspect on the finish provides a bit of spice, but it never overwhelms the wine. So, you can drink this now. Best After 2022 "
571,Patrick Bottex Bugey Cerdon Rose La,Cueille,Sparkling Rosé,France,22,8,4.5,117,"This is gamay and poulsard grown in limestone, fermented without additions and bottled before it’s finished, as a pétillant naturel. If you haven’t tasted Bugey-Cerdon, it may come as a surprise, with sweet notes of candied rose petals, fresh lingonberries, a little greenness and some pink grapefruit acidity. Asked what she might serve with this wine, Tasting Director Sarah Looper suggested pouring it as an aperitif, “or with Vietnamese food, Thai food or light nut desserts like hazelnut cake or a savory strawberry tart”.

It's dry, elegant and absolutely delicious, delivering creamy yellow apple, citrus, baking spice and tangy mineral alongside fresh acidity. Drink now through 2024. This smells of fresh spring greens, but on the generous palate there’s much more yellow fruit (mirabelle and nectarine) and vibrant freshness that leads you into the refreshing lemon and mineral finish.

The 2018 Barbaresco Serraboella Sorì Paitin is glossy and polished with a super fine and delicate quality of fruit. It just glides over the palate as if it were on skates. That beautiful forward momentum is driven by light cassis, dried cherry, iron skillet, candied orange peel and crushed flowers. The finish is exceptionally smooth and elegant. Complimenti. A beefy red, this offers tar, cherry, plum and resin flavors, backed by dense tannins. This is compact and dry on the long finish, but there's ample fruit. Dried red-cherry and berry aromas and flavors with hints of flowers, dried mushrooms and tobacco. There’s a dry-ash note, too, which follows through to the palate and seems to provide the firm tannins with a dry, powdery coating. Medium-bodied with an intense, rather unyielding feel to this now. It will take several years to unwind. Try in 2024. "
576,Champagne Leclerc Briant Brut,Reserve,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,74,12,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The Champagne Leclerc Briant Reserve Brut deftly combines nicely focused fruit and earth from start to finish.

Notes of fresh linen, apple, and white flowers come through in a delicate manner. "
578,Sandeman 20 Year Old,Tawny,Port,Portugal,65,20,4.6,77,"Sandeman’s long-standing reputation for aged tawny Port is confirmed by this wine. It is poised between fresh fruit and spice, dried dates and a generous golden glow. The wine is at its peak and ready to drink. Pretty cherry color with amber edges. Aromas of toffee, brown sugar and burnt caramel with lots of dried fruits. Full. Very sweet. Silky and attractively woody. Real 20-year-old character here. Drink now. Beguiling exercise in delicacy. Pale tawny colour. Light and fruity aromas. Elegant delivery of fruit weight and sugar. Savoury, dry finish. Broad, rich and elegant, with creamy, supple flavors of butterscotch, toasted coconut and hazelnut. The luscious finish is loaded with spice and cocoa details. Seductive. As a young Port wine drinker, I grew up on Sandeman’s 20 Year Tawny, a wine that always over delivered when it came to gingery energy and shimmering fruit. And though the brand has changed hands, now part of Sogrape, the wine still holds its identity, delicately creamy with lovely floral esters and a zesty feel that lasts. The NV 20 Years Old Tawny Porto is a typical Douro blend bottled in August 2022 with a Vinolok cork and 129 grams per liter of residual sugar. For a lot of folks, a 20 Year is the sweet spot in the lineup for Tawnies: It's fresh, so you don't worry about cracking fruit; it's reasonably complex, so it's old enough to be serious; and most of all, it is actually affordable compared to some of the really old ones. This is lovely. Showing a trace of caramel and darker chocolate flavors, this is still dominated by its freshness. Its lively acidity lifts the fruit and allows the flavors to dribble over the palate. It is tightly wound and very focused. It tastes great too, finishing with a touch of sugar and big fruit. That dries out with time and becomes a bit less exuberant and a bit more stern. It acquires a very serious demeanor. It is hard to resist. Best after 2022. "
579,Charles Woodson's Intercept Red Blend,2017,Other Red Blends,California,19,15.5,4.0,106,"COMMENTARY: The 2017 Charles Woodson's Intercept Red Blend defines Paso Robles, a growing region well-known for producing robust red wines.

580,Blackbird Vineyards Contrarian Napa Valley Proprietary Red,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,139,14.1,4.1,7,"Though Blackbird’s original wine was a merlotfocused blend, current winemaker Aaron Pott takes Contrarian in a savory, less voluptuous direction. The wine is grounded by cabernet sauvignon, with a contribution from Ballard Vineyard on Spring Mountain that lends it stature and breed, as well as mineral-inflected tannins that carry the smokiness of rock striking rock. The wine’s blackberry juiciness and black-olive savor gain depth and detail with air, the flavors glimmering like cool water in a well. It has an old-fashioned sense of Napa Valley, before the wines got fancy. Decant it for Mediterranean lamb. Blended of 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Cabernet Franc and 7% Merlot, the deep garnet-purple colored 2016 Contrarian Proprietary Red reveals notes of crushed black and red currants, black cherries and red plums with touches of red roses, black tea, tilled soil and tobacco. Medium-bodied, the palate delivers intense red and black fruit layers with plenty of earthy sparks and a grainy frame, finishing long and refreshing. A juicy and rich red with lots of fruit and polished yet fine tannins. Medium to full body and tight, focused fruit. Delicious now. Why wait? A blend of 64 per cent cabernet sauvignon, 29 per cent cabernet franc and seven per cent merlot. COMMENTARY: Hmm, when I first tasted the Blackbird Contrarian, I thought the winery must be trying to go against the tide. What tide? There are so many storylines in the wine business. Though I have tasted and enjoyed previous vintages, the 2016 vintage was the first time I understood this wine. I got an upfront and close look at this wine, and realize that balance was its reason to be. TASTING NOTES: This wine is immense, yet it stays balanced and superbly structured. Its stylish aromas and delightful flavors of black fruit and oak accents are wrapped nicely together. Instead of producing an overpowering wine, the winery looked to build a stylish and balanced effort. Pair this wine with a crown roast of lamb and enjoy a proper meal. (Tasted: July 8, 2019, San Francisco, CA) 64% Cabernet Sauvignon; 29% Cabernet Franc; 7% Merlot. Not a wine of great power or bombast, but one that exhibits a good deal of finesse, the latest Blackbird Contrarion is a very mannerly, well-polished working that, with each sniff and sip, shows more richness and range as suggestions of sweet oak, fresh loam and dried herbs emerge as complexing complements to its concentrated, ripe currant fruit. Its finish is framed by firm, hard-to-ignore tannins just now, but increasing refinement and a long life appear to be in store here provided one is willing to forego hasty drinking. "

Fermented in concrete, matured for 12 months in foudre and demi-muid. This is brimming with dark cherry, blackberry and boysenberry compote flavors that spill forth, laced with generous licorice snap, tar, graphite and black tea notes.

To the palate, this sparkler shows a lean, steely approach that is terrific for any festive occasion. "

605,Olga Raffault Les Picasses,2016,Cabernet Franc,France,35,13.5,3.5,11,"From a limestone-based plot on the Chinon plateau, the 2016 Chinon Les Picasses features intriguing warming spices, including garam masala, as well as piquant black cherry, all followed up with mouthwatering acidity. Like their other cuvées, it's not showy and extroverted but quiet, its joy being in its tender caress on the midpalate. It has grown up in large foudres (50hl) over a year but reveals little woody influence. The finish has fine sinew and refined chalky tannins that draw the palate out on the lengthy, tea-leaf-like and spiced finish.  This wine is richly structured and still densely tannic. With its ripe red fruits and firm tannins, the wine is destined for aging. Coming from the plateau above the town of Chinon, the wine has density and longevity. Drink from 2021. Sanguine and cigar notes frame the core of damson plum and dark cherry flavors in this medium-bodied, slightly chewy red. Black pepper and rosemary details linger on the finish. This shows great terroir typicity and flavor profile. This wine’s black, smoky tannins hide the sweetness of its lasting blueberry scents. It’s light, firm and spicy; for braised lamb. "

There's enough oak to lend supporting structure, but it doesn't dominate the olfactory or gustatory facets of this wine, which is ripe and concentrated but also streamlined and silky, ending in a lingering, savory and complex finish. Baked blueberries, blackcurrants, ripe blackberries, nutmeg, licorice and peppercorns on the nose. Some ink and oyster shell too. Full-bodied, concentrated and compact with a dense core of black fruit supported by firm tannins. From organically grown grapes. Drink from 2023. One of the clear standouts here is the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Yountville Selection, which has a concentrated, slightly rustic, yet still enjoyable and character-filled style, and it’s clearly well-made. Dark fruits, sous bois, tobacco, and damp earth all define the bouquet, and it’s medium to full-bodied, with firm tannins and good acidity. It should have 15 years of longevity. Ripe cassis, clove, cigar box, toast aromas. Fine tannins, bright acidity and good concentration of blackcurrant fruit with a spicy finish. Blend 90% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot "

It has the potential to age for at least two decades. More than 30 years after starting from modest means, Jacky and Joëlle Blot have established the Domaine de la Taille aux Loups in Moutlouis as one of the great Loire domaines. Their son Jean-Philippe is now increasingly taking over the running of the domaine. Jacky’s passion is dry white Chenin vinified in barriques, with no residual sugar and no malolactic fermentation. Increasingly the accent is on single vineyard wines with their own character – wines of great purity that age brilliantly. Starting in the late 1980s with 7ha, the domaine now has more than 60ha mainly in Montlouis but with two parcels in Vouvray. The latest substantial acquisition was the Clos de Mosny, a 12ha, walled, south-facing vineyard in the southern part of the appellation, in autumn 2010. "

609,Chateau Dalem,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,26,15,3.8,16,"Readers looking for a smoking deal in the vintage should grab bottles of the 2019 Château Dalem. This rich, medium to full-bodied, mouth-filling effort has lots of ripe darker cherry and blackberry fruit as well as tobacco, cedar pencil, and violet nuances. Rich, textured, balanced, and with a real sense of purity and class, it's ideal for enjoying over the coming 10-12, if not 15 years or so. Best after 2022.  Sleek and taut, with chalky threads running along the edges of a core of fresh cherry puree and cassis notes. Features a subtle tobacco accent throughout, with nice cut through the finish. Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now. "

It’s full-bodied with firm, creamy tannins. Round and supple. Some chocolate notes on the finish. Fresh and elegant for the appellation. Drink or hold. Holds the new oak remarkably well (50% new), it's not excessive in aroma or texture from this sample. Well balanced with fine tannins and a little salty note - pretty smart stuff. Should be good when it's ready, no excesses here. Best yet from Lavau. An outstanding wine, the 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape offers lots of ripe black and blue fruits as well as plenty of pepper, cedar, and sappy, green garrigue-like aromas and flavors. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it’s nicely textured and has terrific balance along with a great finish. A blend of 50% Grenache, 40% Syrah, and 10% Mourvèdre, it was aged in 50% new oak, although you wouldn’t know that by tasting it. "
612,Chateau Canon,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,199,14,4.2,15,"Complex aromas of blackberries, iodine, oyster shell and wet earth. Ever so perfumed. Full-bodied, yet reserved and tight with very silky tannins that are energized and minerally. Takes off at the end. The freshness lifts it. Try after 2024. This has all the power that St-Emilion can deliver, but deals it out slowly with precision, gorgeous balance and a clean lift. It has great concentration, purity and depth, without sacrificing the integrity of the juicy blueberry and cassis fruits. It really is a great example of what the limestone plateau can do. The 2015 delivers a slightly more voluptuous edge to the fruits, whereas this vintage emphasises fresh mint leaf, salinity and grip. A wonderful wine, utterly delicious. The 2016 Château Canon is another beautiful wine from this estate, made in a more streamlined, elegant style compared to the richer, sexier 2015. Checking in as a blend of 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc all from a magical terroir situated on the upper plateau just outside of the village of Saint-Emilion, it saw a small percentage of the blend go through malolactic fermentation in barrel, and the wine spent 18 months in 70% new French oak, with the balance in once-used. Gorgeous notes of blueberries, cassis, spring flowers, white truffle, and crushed rock nuances all come soaring from the glass and it has notable intensity as well as complexity. Medium to full-bodied, with vibrant acidity, ultra-fine tannins, and a straight, silky texture, I don’t think it matches the 2015 on concentration, but it’s perfectly balanced and has a texture to die for. It needs a good 4-5 years of bottle age (or more) and it’s going to be long-lived. Tasted three times. This delivers a pretty serious ball of fruit, with a mix of raspberry, blueberry and black currant flavors providing range, while sweet tobacco notes and chalky minerality impart texture and detail. There's a fresh savory echo on the finish. Much less reliant on toast than most of its peers. Best from 2022 through 2037. Very generously appointed with ripe, black cherry fruit and decked
out with a broad sweep of sweet spice in both scent and taste
and showing lovely continuity and fine concentration, Château
Canon is a serious, far-reaching St.-Emilion wine that compels
contemplation and seems to reveal a little more interest with
each sniff and sip. It is not an immense wine, but it is one of
great strength and real beauty that is guaranteed to pay even
greater dividends when laid away and allowed to develop for six
to ten years. "

614,Terra d'Oro Zinfandel,Port,Port,California,25,19,4.2,264,"The first duty of a Port-style wine is to be dazzlingly rich and sweet, yet balanced in acidity, and this bottling is all that. Waves of blackberry jam, cassis, and dark chocolate are brightened with zesty acidity and the sweetness level is very high. Is Port service the ending or just the beginning? Traditionally, Port is served at the end of the meal with blue veined cheeses and/or cigars. Guests often find this to be a fitting capper of a well-orchestrated evening. But for some, this is a time of discussion and reflection—perhaps the evening hasn't ended after all? The Terra d'Oro Zinfandel Port exhibits ripe berries and raisin notes.

Rich and dense, but fresh and floral, too, with fine-grained tannins. Drinkable now.

Like so many wines in 2018, the Chianti Classico is aromatic and gracious in feel, more finesse than power. Silky tannins wrap around a core of bright Sangiovese fruit. From start to finish, the 2018 is all class. This wine combines fruit from high-elevation vineyards on three soil types (predominantly sandstone, galestro and limestone) to give flavors of pure red cherry laced with soft notes of tobacco and herbs. Scents of pink petals add lift, and the wine stays integrated through a fresh, vibrant finish. This red shows some depth to the black cherry, black currant, iron and tobacco aromas and flavors. There is a hint of tar, and the firm structure is well-integrated. Drink now through 2032. "

Gorgeous cassis, violet, graphite, fruitcake, and peppery herbs define this brilliant effort, and it's full-bodied, with a pure, seamless texture, wonderful tannins, and one heck of a great finish. This magical 2019 is going to benefit from 4-5 years of bottle age (it's brilliant even today) yet keep for 20 years or more. Châteauneuf du Pape lovers need to have this in their cellar! Deep violet. A highly perfumed bouquet evokes ripe red/blue fruits, vanilla and candied flowers, along with Moroccan spice and smoky mineral nuances. Sweet and pliant in the mouth, offering assertive Chambord, boysenberry, lavender and spice cake flavors that deepen steadily through the back half. Plush tannins come in slowly, adding shape to a very long, blue-fruit- and floral-dominated finish.   Drenched with the heat and sun of the 2019 vintage, this massively ripe, strapping wine is packed with flavors of roasted plum and black-cherry compote. Accented by whispers of camphor, sweet tobacco and cinnamon, the concentrated, hulking sip is ringed by fiery tannins. The wine needs time. Best After 2024 "

The layered nose offers precise, fruity notes of black currant, mint and cherry, balanced harmoniously by the wood. Complex, with firm, grippy but fine tannins. The lengthy finish is pleasantly compact with a hint of raisin. Dried herbs, tobacco and plum aromas are featured in the nose of this elegant Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from vineyards in the Apalta wine region.

This is an ambitious, all-encompassing blend that is especially accessible in 2018. It offers a harmonious bouquet with wild berry and rose. The tannins are soft and yielding, and you can start enjoying this Barolo without waiting too much longer. Balsamic aromas of menthol mingle with dark spice, underbrush and blue flower. The full-bodied palate offers cherry marinated in spirits, licorice and a hint of coffee bean alongside taut, close-grained tannins that grip the close. "

Vibrant berries abound. Good wine. Try from 2022. This generous wine comes from a 239-acre property. It has weight, layers of black-currant flavors balanced by rich tannins and juicy acidity. The fruitiness is intense, given essential freshness by the crisp aftertaste. Drink the wine from 2022. COMMENTARY: The 2016 Château Blaignan is a well-built red that delivers nicely.

I found more freshness in the 2019 Q Cabernet Sauvignon than in the 2018 I also tasted next to it. This is produced with grapes from Gualtallary and La Consulta, combining structure from Gualtallary and juiciness from La Consulta. Cabernet behaves better in cooler years like this 2020, and the wine matured in a combination of 225- and- 500-liter oak barrels. It's medium to full-bodied and has the telltale fine tannin's from the grape and a chalky finish. "

Eden clone vines planted in 1988, later grafted over from Merlot to Pinot Noir. Pale ruby-purple, it has savory notions of charcuterie, earth, tar and citrus peel with ripe red and black berries. The medium-bodied palate is silky, concentrated and seamlessly fresh, loaded with earthy nuances and finishing long and flavorful. Lovely! Mostly fruit from the Mt. Eden clone, this wine is cool and dark. The oak plays a leading role at first, but starts to recede with air as the wine turns foresty and a touch savory, the dark cherry and strawberry flavors borne with a mouth-coating richness. Impressive. Boiled raspberry and pomegranate aromas meet with rose petals on the nose of this bottling, which pays homage to one of the historic property's former owners. The palate is cohesive in flavor and structure, offering raspberry and sagebrush flavors. All from the Mt. Eden clone of Pinot Noir, from vines planted in 1989, the 2018 Pinot Noir Palmtag Block gives up a savory, complex nose of mulled black cherries, red currants, dried flowers, orange zest, and loamy earth. This carries to a medium-bodied, elegant Pinot Noir with nicely integrated acidity, present yet silky tannins, and a great finish.

This is a combination of 2005 and 2009. Try it in 2024. The crème de la crème from the northern Médoc is the 2015 Mouton Rothschild and this incredible wine flirts with perfection. Made from 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, and 3% Petit Verdot, this inky purple-colored effort offers sensational Cabernet flare in its crème de cassis, graphite, lead pencil shavings, floral, and Asian spice aromas and flavors. It is full-bodied, dense, and incredibly concentrated, yet still has the sexy, opulent, seductive style of the vintage front and center. It will be a candidate for perfection in 10-12 years and is going to be one of the longest-lived wines in the vintage. Hats off to Philippe Dhalluim and his team for this incredible effort that’s a step up over just about every other northern Médoc out there! The 2015 Mouton Rothschild is a blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc aged in 100% new oak with a mid-July 2017 bottling. Deep garnet-purple colored, this Mouton pulls off an incredibly impactful entrance, emerging from the glass with profound notes of blackberry preserves, plum pudding, crème de cassis and grilled meats, featuring perfectly accessorized accents of sandalwood, cinnamon stick and fenugreek with wafts of dried roses, unsmoked cigars and tilled soil. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is completely packed with rich, ripe black fruits sparked with blue and red fruit undertones and an incredible structure of very firm, very ripe tannins, with seamless freshness and an epically long, earth-laced finish. Possessing striking natural beauty framed by impeccable crafting, this 2015 is a total diva and well worth attention. Give it a good 7-8 years in bottle, at least, and drink it over the next 30+ years. Offers a prodigious core of steeped fig, black currant and blackberry compote flavors, enmeshed with notes of smoldering tobacco, charcoal and licorice. Broad, deep and long, with a deep foundation of graphite through the finish. Despite the heft, this manages to show off some purity too. Best from 2025 through 2045. "

Ripe black cherries, forest floor, Asian spices, and chocolate notes all emerge on the nose, and it's full-bodied, ripe, and sexy on the palate, with sweet tannins, no hard edges, and wonderful overall balance. It dishes out tons of pleasure and is a much more approachable, forward wine compared to the Le Défi de Fontenil while still possessing the class to evolve for 10-15 years. Best after 2022. Plenty of sweet-tobacco, graphite, and dark-berry aromas follow through to a medium to full body with attractive ripe fruit and chewy yet round tannins.

Lifted and herbaceous, the 2017 Barolo Ravera is noted by aromas of fresh pine, ripe red cherry, licorice, and menthol. The palate has depth without weight and is noted by ripe raspberry fruit, apricot, and black tea. Notable for its purity of fruit, this Barolo features black cherry, black currant, violet, mineral and tar aromas and flavors. Harmonious and lithe, with an underpinning of mineral that lingers through the dynamic finish. Best from 2025. Flavors of crunchy black cherry surround a taut core of cool, ferrous tannin in this powerful wine.

Tobacco, leather, mint and spices are woven together in this large-scaled Grenache. There is plenty of intensity here, but the 2008 has just a touch less aromatic definition than the very finest wines at Sine Qua Non. I imagine some of that may be the result of extended aging in oak. The 2008 is 82% Grenache, 14% Syrah, 2% Viognier and 1% Roussanne, all from the Eleven Confessions Vineyard in Santa Rita Hills. A portion of the Grenache was fermented using whole clusters. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2023. Remarkably elegant and understated, offering generous, supple plum, blueberry, pepper and spice.

A juicy and savory young 2016. Try after 2024. I remember how delicious this was at en primeur, and it remains a stately, elongated, perfectly poised Pauillac. It's austere, certainly, but is also full of rich fruit pared down by a slate texture, the sense of minerality scraping along the palate as you approach the blackcurrant leaf and tobacco finish. It's excellent quality, and clearly a vintage that suits the personality of Duhart - juicy but restrained. Matured in 50% new oak. Ranking with the finest vintages of this wine to date, the 2016 Château Duhart Milon shows how successful the Médoc was in 2016.

Blended of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot, the 2016 Duhart-Milon has a deep garnet-purple color and features plums preserves, wild blueberries and cassis scents with touches of violets and underbrush with a waft of tobacco. Medium-bodied and elegant, with a backbone of finely grained tannins and oodles of freshness, it has a great core of perfumed black fruit, finishing on an earthy note.

It’s pinot noir at the cusp of ripeness, holding a floral green note that would take on duck rillettes.  56% Chardonnay; 44% Pinot Noir. Spot on with respect to Rosé’s fruitier bent but exhibiting a fine yeasty trim of autolysis and lots of youthful energy, this one is a vivacious, slightly lighter, carefully composed example of the genre that is both moderately rich and light on its feet.

This is massive and widespread on the palate, but the key to its success is impeccable balance. Toasty, minty flavors of blackberry and cassis are chocolaty and lightly herbal, while the finish blends lushness, power, heft and smoky, herbal flavors that go on and on. Drink this Carmenère-led blend through 2024. A dense, ripe and powerful style, with concentrated flavors of dark plum, blackberry and chocolate. Very plush and creamy midpalate, with a rich finish loaded with espresso notes, along with medium-grained tannins. Carmenère, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The 2012 Clos Apalta started off a little closed, but with air, the spicy aromas seemed to dominate (cloves, black pepper); there are also lots of smoky notes over a core of ripe black fruit with a volatile hint. It feels young and greatly marked by its two years in new French oak barrels. The palate is still young and tannic, and the finish is a little dry. There's not a lot of fruit in there and it somehow feels like it lacks a bit in the mid palate. For fans of the style, but even though, you should wait to pull the cork. "

At the same time, the structure is very present, showing power and dark black fruits. The balance is coming together with the rich fruits and tannins melding into one. Drink from 2028. This 2017 has all the markers of a legendary Taylor Port—scents of green fig, the complex tannic impact of schist, the consternating sense of elegance in the face of massive structural power. David Guimaraens bases this wine on fruit from the Quinta de Vargellas, an estate on the south bank of the river in the arid Douro Superior. In our tastings, it came after several 2017s that were sourced from vineyards on the north bank, closer to Pinhão, and, while it would be simplistic to consider this a definitive difference (there are many exposures in each quinta, and other quinta parcels in the blends), there was a stark shift from the blackness of those wines to the sour-cherry impression of this wine, and its floral fraise des bois notes. Those flavors keep pushing up against the dark shadows of the wine’s schist tannins, an undulating wake of red fruit and minerals that carries the wine’s muscular power into memory. "

Full-bodied, with very silky tannins and a chewy, ripe fruit-accented finish. An impressive Mouton. After less than persuasive performances in two potentially great years, 1989 and 1990, Mouton-Rothschild appears to have settled down, producing fine efforts in recent vintages, culminating with the enormously promising, unquestionably profound 1995. The 1994 appears to be the finest Mouton-Rothschild made following the 1986 and before the 1995's conception. The wine exhibits a dense, saturated purple color, followed by a classic Mouton nose of sweet black fruits intermingled with smoke, pain grillee, spice, and cedar. Medium to full-bodied, with outstanding concentration, a layered feel, plenty of tannin, and rich, concentrated fruit, this wine is similar to the fine 1988. By the way, the Dutch artist, Appel, has created a gorgeous label for the 1994. Although Mouton-Rothschild can be among the most inconsistent first-growths, when this estate gets everything right, the wine can be as compelling as any produced in Bordeaux. This is still youthful in appearance with dark ruby color. It sets an excellent example for the 1994 vintage with a spicy, toasty nose showing lots of black currants and tar. It's full-bodied, refined and chewy. "

Medium-bodied yet very concentrated, it has a powdery frame, sparks of refreshing acidity and a very long, graphite-driven finish.

Vibrant purple raspberries mark the nose and palate, lingering elegantly on the finish and picking up hints of wild thyme and bay leaf. I'd rather drink this than some underachieving producer's Châteauneuf, and it should be uncommonly long-lived for a Côtes du Rhône. Best after 2023 Loads of kirsch liqueur, ground pepper, garrigue, and some obvious earthy minerality emerge from the 2019 Côtes du Rhône Les Garrigues, a wine that pushes on the ripeness level while staying balanced, seamless, and weightless. This opulent, hedonistic Grenache is going to keep for 8-10 years. Very dense black-plum bouquet with touches of bitter chocolate, raisin and licorice. For 15.5% alcohol this remains surprisingly cool and restrained on the palate, also thanks to the solid tannin base that gives it a certain grip. Even the finish is quite dry right to the end.

It is utterly gorgeous and has real precision and tension. It delivers its Pauillac swagger with the most gentle of hands - the tannins are fine, layered-up and building their defences without imposing too heavily on the succulent black fruits. It judges the vintage extremely well and is the best in this line-up for me. 1% Petit Verdot completes the blend. 60% new oak. I tasted the 2015 Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande on three separate occasions rating it 97 twice and 98 once. Checking in as a final blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this is a nuanced style of wine that grows on you with time in the glass, and the larger Merlot component always gives it a more supple, seductive texture. Crème de cassis, black raspberries, spring flowers, leafy herbs and lead pencil notes all flow to a full-bodied, ultra-pure, seamless beauty that builds on the palate, has fine tannin and a great, great finish.

Medium-bodied, finely crafted, remarkably pure and beautifully poised, it has a firm frame of very fine-grained tannins and oodles of freshness, finishing on a lingering mineral note. A fresh and focused style, with a terrific beam of black cherry and black currant compote flavors. Strong graphite and black tea notes harness the finish, ending with alder and tobacco echoes. This has serious length without losing any drive along the way. Best from 2022 through 2038. "

The Ravera is a wine of enormous length and a finely tuned texture. Best After 2025 Lighter structure this year, but it’s intense, with focused red-cherry and raspberry character and spicy and mineral nuances. Medium-bodied with firm tannins and a very tight finish.

This cuvée was completely destemmed and saw the same 15% new barrels. "

814,Guigal Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2017,Rhone Red Blends,France,58,15,3.3,12,"Matured two years in oak foudres, this full-bodied blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah balances piercing black cherry and cassis flavors against a firm structure of fine, penetrating tannins and bright acidity. Richly concentrated yet pristine in fruit, it finishes on a sultry, smoky streak of crushed stone and charred anise. Approachable in youth but likely to improve through 2030 and hold longer still. The inaugural vintage of this wine, it has a very fresh, melon and sliced-pear nose with subtle, stony notes. The palate is smooth, sleek and fleshy with attractive peach flavors and a fresh,crisp feel to the gently nutty finish. Drink or hold. The 2017 Chateauneuf du Pape is a blend of 70% Grenache, 15% Mourvèdre, 10% Syrah and 5% other permitted varieties, all aged in foudres for three years. Boasting scents of dried spices, stone fruit and red raspberries, it's medium to full-bodied on the palate, with a rich, velvety feel and a dusting of tannins on the long finish. Show a slightly old school persona, with lots of singed alder, garrigue and leather accents leading the way, while the core of red currant and bitter cherry fruit follows from behind. The long finish has nice grain, with dried fruit and herb notes partnering until the end. Drink now. "
815,Bodega Chacra Mainque Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,Argentina,58,0,0.0,0,"Fresh apricots, white strawberries, cream, crushed stones and lemon meringue on the nose.

Very fresh and focused with persistency and tense layers of white fruit and minerals. Drink or hold. From biodynamically grown grapes. The 2021 Mainqué Chardonnay is the second white here, produced by Jean-Marc Roulot from 40-year-old ungrafted vines in Mainqué in the Lunita property (where they regrafted the vines to Chardonnay), where they work with cover crops, no chemicals and bees. It fermented with indigenous yeasts, 70% in French oak barrels and 10% each in clay amphorae, concrete egg and stainless steel, and it matured for nine months, 70% in barrel and 10% each in concrete and stainless steel. It has the precision and purity of Roulot, which to a certain extent is the result of thorough work with the press. ""He sent us the press program,"" Piero told me. ""And we now have two presses. We are learning."" When I thought about what was in common between the reds and the whites, I came up with three words: precision, purity and elegance. It has notes of white flowers and a touch of fennel and other aromatic herbs. Best after 2022. "

It has finely detailed tannic structure and finishes with great freshness.

The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino La Casaccia takes a little longer to open, but it ultimately reveals the elegance and energy that comes with the house style. Wild cherry, ash and balsam herb drive a long, very polished finish. The La Casaccia site is distinguished by mineral-rich clay soils, which give this wine its power and density Inviting aromas of baked plum, violet, baking spice and sun-warmed hay come to the forefront along with a whiff of leather. The enveloping palate is delicious, delivering ripe Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and nutmeg framed in tightly woven, polished tannins that lend finesse and a smooth texture. Within the Canalicchio area, the Casaccia vineyard boasts a high clay content, which helped curb water stress in 2017. As with all Canalicchio di Sopra’s wines, the grapes were double-sorted to remove any green or sun-dried berries. Pristine in aromas and flavours, this offers clove, cardamom, mint and sweet dark earth on a backdrop of black cherries. The ample, mouth-filling palate is hemmed in by compact, sandy tannins. Underlying succulence makes this quite moreish. Drinking Window 2024 - 2032. This shows the ripeness of the vintage, with ripe-berry, cherry and floral aromas and flavors. Some cedar, too. It’s full and flavorful, with lots of chewy yet polished and focused tannins. A little dusty in texture. Drinkable now, but better in 2023. Black cherry and blackberry flavors hold court in this dense, yet vibrant red, which is defined by brisk acidity.

Let the wine age and drink from 2022. Just 1,200 bottles of this prestige cuvée were made in 2009, a blend of 57% Pinot Noir from vineyards in Ay, Verzenay, Ambonnay and Bouzy. The 43% Chardonnay comes from Avize, Mesnil sur Oger, Chouilly and Villers-Marmery. Its gorgeous colour comes from the inclusion of 6% Pinot Noir still wine, produced by Deutz from plots of old vines on the Ay hillside known as ‘La Belle’, as well as from plots in Mareuil-sur-Ay called ‘Cumaine’ and ‘Charmont’. Classically styled, Deutz's savoir-faire has delivered an elegantly vinous rose with sweet, bright strawberry and redcurrant fruits juxtaposed with savoury toast and brioche.

On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, fine-boned and elegant, with racy acids, a pretty core of fruit, a delicate mousse and a deceptively long finish. Understated but displaying terrific finesse, this wine exemplifies the Deutz style. Creamy and elegant, with a lovely, mouthwatering juiciness to the well-knit acidity and a fine, chalk-tinged underpinning to the delicate flavors of nectarine, white cherry, spring blossom and candied pink grapefruit zest.

844,Gaia Ritinitis Nobilis,Retsina,Other White Wine,Greece,18,12,3.1,135,"Yiannis Paraskevo- poulos’s Ritinitis has set the bar high for Ret- sina for years, but this vintage hits it out of the park. He bases it on roditis grown in the cool heights of the Peloponnese vinified in stainless steel, so that the base wine itself is bright and lively, with vibrant acidity and a mineral grip. The resin, culled from a par- ticular stand of Aleppo pines, goes in fresh and in moderation. The combination always creates a cooling, refreshing Retsina, but this vintage (2020) has an electric intensity. It’s head-turning in aroma, more seaside-pine- grove than direct pine resin, and arresting in flavor, delivering a jolt of bright, fresh herbal flavor that wakes up every nerve in the body. Close your eyes and it might send you direct to a quiet beach on the Aegean, the wind whisking through the pines at your back, a sea-salt haze hanging over the blue sea. "
845,Tolpuddle Vineyard Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,Australia,84,13,0.0,0,"A relaxed nose belies the seductive roll and swirl of a full and voluptuous fruit profile, and a cooler vintage brings a cohesive yet concentrated voice to a tightly-wound meld of flavours. A savoury edge allows minerality to shine, while vibrant energy that tremulously ripples along a lengthy acid spine will maintain the verve in this vintage for a long time. I was shocked at the intensity of the 2021 Chardonnay when I first tasted it. How could a wine so young have this much flavor? It is polished, glassy and graceful. It unfurls in the mouth and soars long over the horizon. It's balanced and powerful, crouching at this early stage, but all the building blocks of greatness are here. A wine of extension, expansion and elegance—a formidable trio. Best After 2022 "
846,El Enemigo Mendoza Gran Enemigo,2017,Other Red Blends,Argentina,86,14,0.0,0,"A refined, medium-to full-bodied red with aromas of blackberry, bitter chocolate, violets, tar and tobacco. Ultra fine tannins, interwoven with silky and seamless layers of dark berries. So elegant and fine. Long. Serious and focused with fantastic depth and structure. Drink or hold. The 2017 Gran Enemigo is half Malbec and 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot from Gualtallary, Uco Valley, along with a 10% dash of Petit Verdot from Luján de Cuyo. It was 30% fermented with stems and aged in French barrels and foudres. The complex nose delivers notes of plum jam, black tea, mint and herbs combined with redcurrants and notes from the aging process such as cedar and ash. In the mouth, it’s intense with a vigorous flow and firm, tannic structure in which the freshness and concentration help to create an easygoing but substantial style before the lengthy finish, which is full of nuanced aromas. Drinking window: 2021 - 2037 The blend 2017 Gran Enemigo was produced with 50% Malbec, 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot from Gualtallary and feels very creamy and undeveloped, ripe without excess but reflecting the warmer and drier year. The blend of grapes has produced a rounder and mellower wine, gentler but still with a very low pH and very good acidity with a dry, chalky-driven finish. This is more open and approachable than the rest of Gran Enemigo from this vintage. It fermented completely destemmed in barrel—it's the only Gran Enemigo that was destemmed, as the rest were 100% full clusters in 2017—and matured in ancient oak foudre. Alejandro Vigil and Adrianna Catena make this malbec-focused blend at their winery in the southern foothills of Maipú. Cabernets sauvignon and franc dominate the aromas, red and spicy, flecked with cedar. Once you drink it, though, there’s no mistaking the weight of malbec. Peppercorn spice adds some complexity to the dark, powerful fruit, and the sappy finish recalls the cedar up front. It’s rich, but there’s just enough freshness to dial it back to a nice place. This Malbec-dominant blend opens with earthy and dark chocolate notes followed by aromas of ripe blackberry. It’s balanced and has smooth tannins framing black fruit, spices and coffee bean flavors. The finish is long with oaky notes in the aftertaste. It’s very enjoyable. "

Its crisp aromas and flavors of tart citrus and ginger should pair nicely as an aperitif with hors d'oeuvres.

856,Chandon Blanc de Pinot,Noir,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,California,25,12,4.2,124,"COMMENTARY: I have found the Chandon Blanc de Noirs to be a very consistent and excellent sparkling wine. Having tasted it since its inception in the mid-1970s, I have enjoyed it with a wide variety of foods choices as well as occasions. And now there is a change and Pauline Lhote—who ""at age 14 told her parents she wanted to be a winemaker, and specifically that she wanted to make sparkling wine"" -an excerpt from her bio from the winery's website. Everything seems to be changing with the times. This wine is fresher, zesty, and reflects the lighter style of foods that have become the trend. Now at 34 Lhote is re-making the Chandon Blanc de Noirs, and it is quite stunning. TASTING NOTES: This wine is fresh and bright. Its aromas and flavors of wild strawberries, bright cherries, and just a hint of yeastiness should pair it well with fresh salmon sushi, steamed Dungeness crab accented with cherry tomatoes, or lightly-seared sea scallops. (Tasted: December 20, 2018, San Francisco, CA) Made from 93% Pinot Noir and 7% Pinot Meunier, this is a lovely sparkling wine, rounded and layered with moderate acidity. The flavors dance around aspects of wild strawberry, raspberry and melon, with a lasting tease of hazelnut. A subtle pink grapefruit character with toasted hazelnuts, and aromas of apples and pears. Dry, vivacious and very accessible.  A festive sparkler, with bright cherry and raspberry flavors highlighted by graham cracker and spice. The finish is marked by a burst of fruit.  "

There is a lot of purity in this wine, and it shows the effect of the cooler year. They are increasing the percentage of used barrique, and the oak feels better integrated. It's a very serious wine, with depth, complexity and persistence. I think there's more and more effect from the limestone soils in the wine (texture!) as the élevage marks the wine is a softer way. This is among the finest vintages of Terreus. This deep-ruby-colored wine has a bouquet of black cherry, black olive paste and thyme. It is smooth on the palate, with plush tannins and flavors of black cherry, blackberry, clove, dark chocolate and dried mountainside herbs that culminate in a soft, spicy finish. "

They enlisted Michel Tardieu and Philippe Cambie to help build their cellar, and, more locally, Bixente Oçafrain, to make the wines. Artigas focuses on garnacha (70 percent), with cabernet sauvignon and old-vine carignan, the blend combining bitter red fruit notes and sweet red berry flavors in a cool, floral balance. Tasting two vintages of the red blend Artigas showed the differences between 2017 and 2018 quite clearly. The 2017 Artigas, 80% Garnacha and 10% each Cariñena and Cabernet Sauvignon, feels riper and has harder tannins even though it's more polished and integrated by extra time in bottle. "

Medium to full-bodied, incisive and tightly wound, if the 2006 vintage was gourmand and demonstrative, the 2008 is slower to show all its cards. Built around racy acids and complemented by a pillowy mousse, this rendition of Cuvée Rare will reward a few years more on cork. "

Full-bodied with racy tannins and gorgeous fruit. Linear and very long. Slightly chewy. Needs time to come together, but already excellent quality. Drink after 2023. 2017 was marked by the frost of the night between April 27 and 28 that Vega Sicilia fought with their anti-frost towers. The end of the season was warm, and the overall rain was low, 235 liters. The 2017 Valbuena is marked by these circumstances, produced with 94% Tinto Fino (Tempranillo) and 6% Merlot, with good ripeness (14.5% alcohol) and mellow acidity (4.65 grams of tartaric acid and a pH of 3.85). The grapes were cooled down and took three to four days of maceration to start fermenting with indigenous yeasts. The wine matured in a combination of new and used French and American 225-liter oak barrels and 21,000-liter oak vats for almost three years. The result, for whatever reason, was nothing short of spectacular. The wine is perfumed, floral, expressive and balsamic like few vintages before. It doesn't feel like a 2017 at all; it is harmonious, and the tannins were fine. It's an amazing Valbuena that clearly transcends the character of the vintage. What I see here is that since 2010, the wine has a very high consistency. And in 2017 it excels. Proof that in a tough year (memorable frosts and summer heat) top producers can be relied on to produce fine wines. The 2017 jumps out of the glass with cherry and redcurrant conserve, and flowers. It enters fresh, with succulent cranberry fruit. Finally finishing with dark fruits embedded in mocha and spicy fenugreek. Complete. Following the Vega Sicilia pattern, it spent its first year in barriques (20% American, 40% French). And then a second year in the impressive army of 80-220hl tinas (wooden vats). A savory thread of fragrant wild herb, cedar and leather winds through a creamy range of damson plum, dried fig, olive tapenade and smoke in this supple, layered red, which is rich and concentrated, but harmonious overall, integrating a frame of dense tannins and orange peel acidity. Ends with a lingering, spiced finish. "

It offers a clean, classic, straightforward bouquet of cassis, toasted spice, and graphite as well as medium-bodied richness and depth, present yet ripe tannins, and a solid finish. "
930,Piero Benevelli Barolo Mosconi,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,76,14.5,0.0,0,"Benevelli's Barolo Mosconi is big and strapping in feel. The Mosconi is loaded with graphite, tobacco, melted road tar, cloves, leather and incense. Time in the glass brings out the wine's layers and overall depth. This powerhouse Barolo is such a head-turner today. "
931,Egly-Ouriet Les Vignes de Bisseuil,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,119,0,0.0,0,"A new cuvée from Egly makes its debut in the NV Brut Vignes de Bisseuil, a blend of 70% Chardonnay and the balance equal parts Pinot Meunier and Pinot Noir, all vinified in oak. This first release, disgorged in March 2021 with three grams dosage, is based on the 2016 vintage. Offering up aromas of crisp orchard fruit, lemon oil, mint, white flowers and almonds, it's medium to full-bodied, vinous and chiseled, its enveloping core of fruit girdled by bright acids and chalky structure. Concluding with a long, saline finish, it's a superb addition to the range that nips at the heels of Egly's NV Brut Grand Cru. "
932,Aslan Maremma Toscana Rosso,2016,Tuscan Blends,Italy,29,13.5,0.0,0,"Medium ruby-colored, the 2016 Maremma Toscana Rosso checks in as a blend of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 10% Merlot. Notes of black cherries, hints of black currants, scorched earth, some earth and licorice are followed by a medium-bodied red that’s silky and refined, with beautiful purity and fine tannins. As with the other wines here, it's a terrific value. "
933,Pertinace Nebbiolo,2019,Nebbiolo,Italy,24,13.5,3.9,6,"Lightly jammy strawberry and raspberry character to this fresh young nebbiolo. Medium-bodied with firm, fine tannins and persistent fruit, helped along by citrus acidity. "

Rather a stylish, elegant nose, pure poised and gracious, crushed raspberry style fruit, very persistent. A ripe coulis de framboise style of fruit but really pleasing. Bottled with a DIAM 30 organic closure. The 2017 Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru has a primal bouquet of black cherry and crushed strawberry fruit, becoming more confit-like with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit and fine depth and poise. Crisp and taut with a pleasant brittle texture toward the finish. It needs time, but it will come good in the end. Closure is Diam 30 Organic. Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2017 tasting. Best After 2025 Light reduction and wood blur the nuance of the red berry fruit and earth scents so I again would counsel a quick aeration. The sleek and seductively, indeed even silky, textured medium-bodied flavors are attractively refined thanks to the dense but finely grained tannins that give shape to the lingering and refreshing finish that offers slightly better depth.

942,Purlieu Missouri Hopper Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,209,0,0.0,0,"Loads of blackcurrants, smoked tobacco, gravelly earth, espresso, and chocolate notes emerge from the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Vineyard, a Graves-look alike that offers full-bodied richness, ripe, polished tannins, a dense, rich mid-palate, and a blockbuster of a finish. Reminding me of a great vintage from Smith Haut Lafitte, it can be drunk today or cellared for 20 years or more. "

944,Champagne Leclerc Briant Blanc de Meuniers Brut Zero,2015,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,240,12.65,0.0,0,"Hervé Jestin ferments this pinot meunier in oak barrels where it then ages for nine months. One taster compared the smokiness of this wine to a peaty Highland Scotch, even if that aspect is a highlight. It’s the ripe red fruit that drives the wine, cushioned by oak tannins, its delicate strawberry notes lasting with finesse. The flavors would meld with the sweetness of broiled unagi. This silky, polished champagne is produced from certified organic grapes grown in the premier cru village Chamery (Petite Montagne), fermented in cask and aged ten months on the lees before bottling. The wine was disgorged in June 2019 and finished with no dosage. The result is arrestingly pure and elegant, with aromas that range from lime peel to ripe apple and toast, a discreet, well-integrated autolysis, and an impressively lingering finish. "
945,Laurent Fayolle Les Diognieres Hermitage Rouge,2019,Syrah/Shiraz,France,109,13.5,0.0,0,"Coming from a site on the eastern side of the hill, the 2019 Hermitage Les Diognieres reveals a dense purple color as well as a beautiful array of cassis and darker berry fruits along with notes of pepper, loamy earth, and cedary spice. Just gorgeous on the palate and all about finesse and elegance, it has silky tannins, full body, no hard edges, and remarkable balance. I love it today, yet it has a solid 20+ years of longevity ahead of it. A fresh, lifted, intense nose with star anise, incense, and clove among the black fruits. Very powerful but not massively full-bodied, the alcohol however is high. Though fine, the tannins just a little hard, and there's a touch of slightly drying oak tannin. Finishes long and will be good in time. The oak influence is pronounced but it works with the wine. From a 0.28ha plot in lieu-dit Les Dionnières at the foot of the hill. 60-year-old vines, all destemmed. Vinified in open demi-muids, manual punching down two or three times a day. Followed by malolactic fermentation and 14 months ageing in barriques. Cedar and cracked pepper notes mark the nose of the fully destemmed 2019 Hermitage les Dionnieres, backed by ripe blueberries and black cherries. Smooth, ripe and creamy in feel, this full-bodied yet supple Hermitage looks to be a top-flight effort. With the concentration and balance evidenced on the long, silky finish, it's delicious now and should still be going strong well into the next decade. Inviting, with warm plum compote and cherry pâte de fruit notes laced with melted red licorice, red tea, fruitcake and floral accents. The nice polished feel through the finish adds to the flattering style. Best from 2023 "

A blend of cabernet sauvignon with 20 percent merlot and 15 percent sangiovese, Grattamacco aged in French oak barriques, about one-third new, where the lightly chewy tannins developed, giving shape to the bold, primary frut tones. The wine takes on notes of graphite and fresh tobacco, while lively spices energize the fruit, drawing out the flavors on a long, exuberant finish. Coming on the heels of the scorching hot 2017, this vintage started off with lots of rain in April and May that required preventative measures against fungal disease. Splendid heat and sunshine marked the summer months, but the freshness you taste in this wine is a beautiful characteristic of this cooler growing season. The 2018 Bolgheri Superiore Grattamacco reveals a finely nuanced bouquet with dark fruit, tobacco, smoke and earthy garrigue or underbrush. The wine leans toward full-bodied, but it also feels quite elegant and crisp on the streamlined finish. Best after 2023. A mix of coffee and black olive flavors shade the core of black currant and black cherry in this dense, linear red, which is focused and long, with a mouthwatering finish. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese. Best from 2024 through 2040. Currants, blackberries and hints of chocolate and fresh herbs. Full-bodied and round-tannined with a lovely texture and a savory, almost iron finish. Cabernet sauvignon, merlot and sangiovese. From organically grown grapes. Hard not to drink now, but a year or two will bring it even more together. "

949,El Enemigo Gran Enemigo Agrelo Single Vineyard,2016,Cabernet Franc,Argentina,120,13.9,0.0,0,"This is a crazy nose with crushed cloves, black pepper and blueberries. Full body. Dense, polished tannins and a wonderfully fruity and intense palate. So much clove and spice at the finish. A joy to taste and drink. Cabernet franc with 15% malbec. Drink or hold. As with all the other wines, the 2016 Gran Enemigo Agrelo Single Vineyard showed more freshness than its sibling from 2015, and the exotic note of Indian bazaar—a recurring note in this bottling—was subtler and in the background, leaving room for more nuance and filigree but with that curry-like twist in there. The palate shows more tension and feels more fluid, with a nice core of cherry-pit freshness. This is surprisingly good, because the year was not easy in the zone, and this clearly transcends the conditions of the harvest. Black berry and dark plum aromas are a touch rubbery and roasted at first, but more open after airing. A smooth but robust palate is full but balanced, with spicy, peppery berry flavors that are lightly herbal but not green. A sappy, jammy finish plays up the herbal side of this blend from a wet and difficult year. Drink through 2024. "
950,Casanuova delle Cerbaie Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,2012,Sangiovese,Italy,99,15,0.0,0,"Baked plum, star anise, aromatic herb, new leather and pressed violet scents create an enticing bouquet. The powerfully structured savory palate offers dried black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and tobacco framed in firm fine-grained tannins. You'll also note the warmth of alcohol on the close, but the fruit richness keeps it in check. Drink after 2022. This is a robust and unflinching red wine with a succulent core of ripe cherry fruit. The 2012 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Vigna Montosoli is more restrained and elegant compared to many of its peers from this hot vintage. Those scorching summer temperatures have been expertly absorbed, and the wine never feels jammy or heavy. The mid-weight finish is fine and graceful. A big very ripe nose with plums and raisins. This is a rich and powerful wine, but with moderate tannins for a Brunello. This makes it quite easy to drink now. The finish has a lot of earthy depth. Probably has two decades ahead of it. Drink or hold. "

Vajra 2018 Barolo Coste di Rose shows a large aromatic scope and ample substance. This vineyard is characterized by very high density Diano sandstone (typical of the area), which explains the wine’s bigger sensorial impact. Its texture is velvety and smooth, and the wine offers lots of purple and red fruits with soft earth and perfumed flower. The vintage is open knit and broad in scope, perhaps lacking some of the brilliant focus you get in the cooler years. Intense and vibrant, displaying cherry, plum, earth, iron and tar flavors. The tannins are dense and assertive, yet this has energy and length, with all the components in the right place. Very clean red-berry fruit on the nose, together with citrus and cedar notes. Medium body with fine-grained tannins and a tight bead of fruit at the end. Sustainable. Plenty of hidden depth of black cherry and plum. Notes of Raspberry and strawberries with complexity and a fine balance and length. "
954,Quinta do Vesuvio Vintage Port,2019,Port,Portugal,89,20,0.0,0,"This is really vivid, with a beautiful range of cassis, cherry purée, boysenberry coulis and plum reduction notes unfurling across the palate while succulent licorice, warm fruitcake and enticing red and black tea. "
955,Crown Point Relevant Red,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,89,14.6,0.0,0,"The 2019 Relevant Cabernet Sauvignon matured for 20 months in new, once- and twice-filled French oak barrels. Deep ruby, it features pure aromas of cassis, grilled meats, warm chocolate, dried herbs, roasted peppers and hints of violet. The medium-bodied palate is powdery and fresh, striking a balance between ripe blackcurrant fruit, classy new oak spices and alluring herbal streaks. It's a balanced, drinkable style of Cabernet that's a pleasure to drink! Best after 2022. "
956,Chateau de Fosse-Seche Laurasie Rouge,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,France,79,12.5,0.0,0,"Darker in its ruby color, the 2019 Laurasie is a pure Cabernet Sauvignon from almost 20-year-old vines on the stony Jurassic plateau of Fosse-Sèche, where yields are not bigger than 20 hectoliters per hectare. This is fleshy and concentrated yet pure, fresh and elegant on the deep, terroir-driven and beautifully floral (violets) as well as graphitic nose that is absolutely distinctive in its delicate, pure and balanced style. Black and blue berries, dark cherries, green paprika, pencil lead and herbal, wet gravelly notes lead to a medium to full-bodied, highly elegant, refined and perfectly balanced palate that exhibits perfectly ripe, round and juicy fruit with a firm but ripe, very fine and elegant tannin/acidity complex. The finish of this concentrated red is tight, intense and spicy, showing black berry and chocolate as well as graphite and coal with dark cherry notes. Irresistible and, in 2019, possibly the finest wine from Fosse-Sèche. The wine was aged for 12 months in concrete eggs. Tasted in January 2021. "

The palate paints a fuller picture, using the broad strokes of lemon to reveal brightness, depth and chalky coolness. This wine still needs to knit its divergent parts together but all the elements are there. A touch of smoky reduction masks the bulk of the aromas save for delicate citrus nuances so I would suggest decanting this first. Otherwise there is notably better refinement to the well -detailed and energetic flavors that possess a finer texture on the refreshing if only moderately complex finale. "

This duly follows, pervaded by ripe lemon zestiness. Although still slightly funky with yeast in places, the wine is lively, profound and smooth. Allow it to come into its own and drink 2022–2040. Mid yellow colour. The 2019 Long Depaquit Vaillons offers a clear and classic nose, the refinement of little stones, plenty of juice in the fruit behind, not over ripe, though perhaps a little more heat at the back, but this is still true to type.

Made with organic fruit, this is a delicate and graceful expression of Sangiovese with bright red fruit, cassis, lilac, earth and lavender essence. With fruit from a cool 420 meters in elevation, this is one of the standout bottles of the vintage. "

TASTING NOTES: This wine explodes with aromas and flavors of black fruits, rocks in the desert, and chalky notes. Enjoy it with garlic and rosemary-infused roast leg of lamb. (Tasted: September 6, 2022, San Francisco, CA) From the producer's estate vineyard on the north-eastern side of the valley, this is an earthy, elegant and classically structured wine, 100% varietal and aged 22 months in entirely new French oak. Cedar, pencil shavings and cassis combine around a core of structured tannin and powerful length. Soft, velvety cabernet with lots of blackcurrant and chocolate character and some citrus undertones. Rather plush. Full-bodied. Round texture and an opulent finish. Drink in 2022. Loads of spiced red and black fruits, mulled cherries, cedarwood, chocolate, and candied violet notes emerge from the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Janzen Cloudy's Vineyard, and this full-bodied beauty has a rounded, expansive texture as well as beautifully polished, silky tannins.

Distinctively zesty with bright, citrusy fruit on the medium-bodied palate, rounded by firm, juicy tannins. Quite a long, outstanding entry-level red from this traditional producer. Very drinkable now, but will also hold. The 2014 Viña Cubillo Tinto Crianza is a textbook vintage with some aromatic development, notes of fresh blood and some grainy tannins, perhaps less polished than previous vintages, lively and concentrated, a bit harsh. 2014 was a very rainy vintage. This is usually a blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacho and 5% each Graciano and Mazuelo matured in well-seasoned, neutral American oak barrels for three years. "

On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and charming, with a youthfully frothy but refined mousse, a succulent core of fruit and ripe but racy balancing acids. It's already drinking well. Vibrant and balanced, with flavors of nectarine, candied orange peel, slivered almond and oyster shell set on a lacy texture. Fragrant hints of white blossoms and lemon thyme show on the finish.  "

Seductive blackberry essence, dusty plum skin, dark cherries and cassis waft out of the glass with delicate dusty floral tones, dried tobacco and graphite nuances. Medium to full-bodied, the wine is balanced with rich complexity and an elegant mineral tension before offering up a clearly delineated fruit frame compounded by focus, precision and finesse. At present, the wine has a pleasingly tannic edge and finishes with a mineral tension and red-fruited succulence that continue to evolve in the mouth. COMMENTARY: The 2017 Andrew Will Champoux Vineyard Red Wine is powerful, lavished, and elevated on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine brings aromas and flavors of extravagant black fruits and oak.

It comes from unquestionably one of the top vineyards on Red Mountain and spent 18 months in French oak. Lots of classic Red Mountain tannins and minerality as well as notes of cassis, currants, dried herbs, graphite, and loamy soil define this beauty, and it's medium to full-bodied and wonderfully balanced, with a round, expansive mouthfeel and a great finish. Well worth seeking out, it’s going to deliver the goods for a solid two decades. A blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot, the 2018 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard displays a deep ruby color at its core with a dark magenta rim. Aromas of dusty black cherry skin, juicy plum and soft savory herbs sway out of the glass with a soft rustic element of worn leather and wilted lavender. Medium to full-bodied, the blend has a focused and balanced palate offering up layers of complexity and fine-grained tannins. Ending with a food-friendly finish, the blend will have no challenges lasting for a decade. This blends cabernets sauvignon and franc, the rest merlot and petit verdot, mostly from vines planted in the mid-’90s. The savor in this wine hints at vine age: scents of sundried tomato, cedar and sandalwood. The flavors are all plum and blackberry, its plum-skin tannins framing a plump middle, and plenty of extract for something formidable off the grill, like ribs. "

On the palate, it's full-bodied, sweet and fleshy, with an ample, voluptuous profile and a generous core of somewhat grapey fruit, concluding with a creditably intense, expansive finish. This is a lusty, pleasure-bent Malmsey. The Madeira regulations say that 10-years old is the age of the youngest part of the blend. So this richly sweet Malmsey contains many older wines. These are shown in the old gold color, the proper citrus acidity and the dryness that goes with wood aging. At the end, though, the liquid honey flavors are dominant. The Broadbent 10 Years Old Malmsey Madeira explodes on the palate with a load of ripe raisins and sweet caramel. Long and ultra-sweet in the finish, this is best enjoyed with conversations.

A touch of French press coffee lingers on the finish. Drink now This 2020 Blue Eyed Boy Shiraz is a fascinating wine to me, in that it offers everything that I might find challenging in one glass (high alcohol at 16%, prominent American oak and volumes of generous, abundantly concentrated, extracted fruit), yet it does so in such a way that I end up appreciating the construction and the execution despite my stylistic preferences. It's a smart wine. On the nose, there is toasted coconut (American oak fermentation and elevage), chocolate-coated raspberries, licorice bullets, lamb roast, star anise and resinous char. In the mouth, the fruit plumes over the palate and blankets the mouth in flavor. Cushioned, pillowed and very intense, the alcohol provides warmth and density through the finish. Drink it in the short to medium term to capture the vibrancy of the fruit. "

It’s a classic Barolo with its savory red fruits, tar, licorice, and spice-driven aromatics. These carry to a medium-bodied red that has silky tannins, plenty of elegance, and the more forward, charming style of this vintage. Drink it over the coming 10-12 years or more. "

This inky hued effort offers textbook Voge aromas and flavors of red and blue fruits, violets, iron, and peppered game.

979,Paolo Scavino Barolo,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,47,14.5,0.0,0,"Vivid aromas of red berries and roses follow though to a medium-bodied palate, where fine tannins provide a lightly firm bed for fresh fruit. The lighter, brighter style of this is true to the character of the vintage, but here it’s been well-handled. All in balance.  The Paolo Scavino 2018 Barolo is a pretty wine with sweet primary intensity that appears as tart cherry and dried raspberry. With Enrico Scavino's signature on the front label, this is a classic package with silky tannins and a long, polished mouthfeel. Fruit comes from multiple vineyard sites across the appellation. Best After 2024 "
980,Bodega Norton Privada,2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,Argentina,25,14.5,3.9,80,"Enticing roasted spices, peppermint and cocoa powder oozing from the glass, knitting the ripe, lustrous black fruit. Rich and full-bodied, but not jammy. Good density of flavors to chew on with a solid, velvety tannin structure. Lots of verve. Lengthy finish. Serious stuff. A blend of malbec, cabernet sauvignon and merlot. A black color backed by smoky aromas of blackberry, cassis, black olive and raw oak open this burly Bordeaux-style blend. Oak-based tannins make for a palate with resiny grab, while this is packed with toasty blackberry and herbal flavors. On the finish, this simmers with heat and oak before slipping away. Plush at first, with refined red currant, sour cherry and tar flavors, supported by firm acidity and tannins. Bakers' chocolate notes and hints of freshly ground pepper show on the finish. Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. "

982,Donnafugata Ben Rye (375ML half-bottle),2019,Other Dessert,Italy,47,14.2,5.0,17,"A really complex dessert wine that can still remember that it was made from grapes, and the aromatic Zibibbo grape gives this an extraordinary range of aromas, from caramelized mandarin orange and dried apricot to black tea, via popcorn and sauteed peanuts. Such a beautiful balance of lush exotic-fruit and orange flavors and lively acidity. Everything fits so neatly and this still tastes fantastic now, but the longer you wait the better! Drink or hold. This gorgeous sweetie is the color of burnished gold and melts like cotton candy on the palate. Exudes aromas and flavors of baked apricot, ground cardamom, mandarin orange jam, clover honey and a rich hint of graham cracker. Vibrant acidity frames the long and well-spiced, mouthwatering finish.  "

Full-bodied with very well-formed tannins that show both polish and finesse, providing a solid backbone to the wine, but without being chewy. The finish is long and controlled, guided by the super tannins. Excellent winemaking. They got the best out of the vintage here.  Sun-kissed hay, cherry, plum, iron and tar flavors are the highlights of this expressive red. Dense and firmly structured, with a tightly knit, tannic finish.  "

988,Chateau Berliquet,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,53,14.5,0.0,0,"Blackberry, plum, blueberry and some stone and crushed cement on the nose. Full body with firm, chewy and ultra fine tannins that will soften nicely. I like the lightly smoked nuts and chocolate. Needs time to come around. Try after 2025. Powerful and plush as it opens after an initial moment of full-on austerity. This needs a good 30 minutes in the glass to really open, and I suggest giving it a full eight to 10 years in bottle before it reaches the right moment to start drinking. This was the first full year for the Canon team, and the work will take another few years to fully show results, but this has clear blueberry and raspberry fruits, structured tannins and a density that comes from the clay that is shot through the limestone in the vineyard. Harvested around two weeks earlier than under the previous owner. The 2018 Berliquet is composed of 78% Merlot and 22% Cabernet Franc and has 14.5% alcohol. Deep garnet-purple in color, it slowly unfurls in the glass to reveal a classic nose of ripe black plums, wild blueberries and pencil shavings with hints of unsmoked cigars, tilled soil and red roses. The medium to full-bodied palate is chock-full of blue and black fruit preserves, supported by plush tannins and impressive freshness, finishing long and mineral laced. Since the Chanel takeover and under Nicolas Audebert’s direction, the development of this site and the wine are truly impressive. I suspect a lot of selection has gone into making this 2018, and the results reveal a top-tier Saint-Émilion in the making. Under the same winemaking team as Château Canon, this wine shows richness, with swathes of ripe black-fruited Merlot and a licorice character. Bold, ripe flavors are warm and opulent, mitigated by fresher black-currant acidity at the end. Drink from 2026. This is delightful, with a fine chalky thread running through the middle of gently crushed plum and black cherry fruit flavors while sweet tobacco and bay accents hang in the background. Sneaky long. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. "

TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of savory spices, red and blackcurrants, and a trace of oak. Enjoy it with a nicely grilled ribeye.

993,Mollydooker The Boxer Shiraz,2020,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,32,16,4.3,32,"Black licorice, kirsch and Kalamata olive notes are dense and dark, but give way to plush blackberry, blueberry and Earl Grey tea accents. This harmonious version gains complexity on the finish. Drink now  The fruit this year was sourced from McLaren Vale 100%, and despite the warmer vintage, the 2020 The Boxer Shiraz is slightly lower in alcohol than the following 2021 (the product of a cooler vintage—go figure). Here, the 2020 Boxer is more balanced and settled, and whether that is due to an extra year in bottle or the regional sourcing for fruit (methinks a combo of the two), the wine is showing really well. This is a big volume wine—the biggest in the portfolio—but drinks better than that. The immaculate and highly organized winery, which I visited in June, may have something to do with that.

(Tasted: February 2, 2022, San Francisco, CA) At first, this wine’s pineapple-core waxiness dominates its ripe fruit. With some air, though, bitter aperitivo-herb scents lighten it, the flavors coalescing into cherry pit. It’s mouthwatering, and would garner compliments around the pool or at a high-end dinner party. Rich and having fine red fruits, this wine, with its high proportion of Grenache, has intense pepper flavor as well as crisp berry acidity. It is densely textured and ready to drink. "

A dense, layered mouthfeel makes for a full-bodied palate that's explosive yet somehow so refined and pretty all at the same time. The finish goes on and on. The 2012 Amarone della Valpolicella Monte Lodoletta is a beautifully complete wine, even at this young stage in its life. You feel the youth of the wine in the tightness of the tannins and in the finely knit texture of its concentrated flavor profile. The big surprise is the wine's fresh acidity that has been carefully safeguarded despite the heat of the vintage and the drying process so deftly executed at this landmark estate. The wine shows no sign of oxidation or evolution, not yet. There is intricate fruit layering with cherry, blackberry, spice and mesquite delivered with such precision, that level of detail defies the very bold and opulent essence of the wine. It has only just started its evolutionary journey. Aromas of underbrush, prune, minestrone soup and grilled bell pepper lead the nose while whiffs of French oak, leather and coconut stay in the background. The densely concentrated, tightly knit palate offers raisin, blackberry extract, clove, licorice and dried sage while assertive grainy tannins leave an astringent mouth-drying finish. "

Floral, exotic red-berry flavors are spicy and in sync with each other. A crisp, peppery finish with toasty oak ensures that this single-vineyard Malbec is built to last It feels like 2014 is a great vintage for Finca Mirador, as seen in the 2014 Malbec Finca Mirador, which usually suffers in the comparison with its siblings in early tastings, because it tends to have a more backward personality. It wears the name of a plot of Malbec in Medrano planted with old vines, which tends to be the warmest of their estate vineyards. It feels like the cooler 2014 climate compensated the heat of the place nicely, and the wine comes through as fresh. In Medrano the soils are quite heavy, so you have to take care to get healthy grapes, and it feels like the low yields avoided the problems with the summer rains; the wine is very clean. These high-end wines are always aged in new French oak. Uplifting and inviting aromas of dark cherries and black pepper; these flow into juicy black fruits in the mouth twinned with a complex graphite and stony edge. This is all underpinned by a grippy finish and beautiful freshness. An elegant style, with supple flavors of cherry pie and plum tart that blend easily.

Originally purchased grapes were used to build a modern style; today the winery owns almost 70% of the vineyard and is aiming for 100%. A focus on precision in winery saw grapes going into 42 separate deposits. Oak has been reined back from 100% new; with just 10% American oak.

While rich, it is light in sensation, like a cloud of Chenin filling the mouth, and finishes with a fine, almost powdery and chalky texture. Initially this dry Vouvray is a bit closed on the nose, but has terrific structure and wonderful elegance on the rather rich yet very focused palate. Then, with some aeration, the delicate citrus-zest and peach-skin aromas develop. Long finish that’s simultaneously creamy and stony. From bio dynamically grown grapes.

They do a soft extraction in stainless steel using 20% full clusters and indigenous yeasts, achieving a wine with moderate alcohol (13.47%) and good freshness (pH 3.47). I felt like the wine had gone one step up in complexity and depth from the previous vintage; it's precise, harmonious, elegant and nuanced and keeps varietal purity. It's medium-bodied and has very fine tannins with herbal freshness, reminiscent of acid berries and bay leaf.  "

The destemmed and lightly crushed grapes fermented in concrete and oak vats with indigenous yeasts, and the wine matured in French oak barrels for 12 months. What happened here is that Cariñena was burned by a heat spike of 43 degrees Celsius on the 28th of June, and there was a wildfire in Montsant that perhaps could have warmed things up even more. I think there might be a change toward more Garnacha and elegance in the wines from Álvaro Palacios in Priorat, as this is brighter and less rustic than this wine used to be, more polished, perfumed and fine. The year of heat and drought. A solid Priorat with fine-grained tannins and mineral, berry and light spice undertones. Medium body. Fruity and focused finish. Drink or hold.

The medium-bodied palate strikes a fine balance between satiny, concentrated fruit and focused acidity, and the finish is long, layered and detailed. A strong mineral streak of rainy sidewalk and chalk kick off the focused nose of this bottling, which opens ever so slightly toward lime pith, jicama and nectarine. The chiseled stone texture and flavor of the palate is pleasantly relentless, wrapping around the light lime and green-lemon flavors. Juicy acidity and a note of salted caramel mingle with mango, green apple and tangerine flavors at the core of this succulent white, which is vibrant on the finish. Drink now through 2027. "

Rich and inky, the 2018 offers up a compelling mélange of dark berry fruit, dark spice, licorice and espresso. I especially admire the wine's textural richness. I imagine the 2018 will drink well for many, many years to come. In this tasting it is a total knock-out.

Medium to full-bodied, velvety and vibrant, with a fleshy core of fruit, ripe tannins and lively acids, it's nicely concentrated, concluding with a long, perfumed finish. I love the combination of ripeness and freshness in this sophisticated and very elegant Morgon, which does a very good job in hiding its substantial tannin structure. Quite a firm finish that will need some time to marry with the deep red-fruit character. Drinkable now, but best from 2024. 9 days maceration, bottled 15 May after ageing in concrete tanks. Deep purple without the pink rim. This is altogether more muscular, and indeed spicy, with very evident whole bunch character though on blacker fruit. The acidity is comparatively tamed.  "

Somewhat meaty, mealy oak lingers beneath. In the mouth, the red fruit and spice feel fresh, even if the acidity is a little sharp. Chiseled, savory tannins add some heft.

1103,Chateau Leoville Las Cases,1995,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,359,0,0.0,0,"If it were not for the prodigious 1996, everyone would be concentrating on getting their hands on a few bottles of the fabulous 1995 Leoville-Las-Cases, which is one of the vintage's great success stories. The wine boasts an opaque ruby/purple color, and exceptionally pure, beautifully knit aromas of black fruits, minerals, vanillin, and spice. On the attack, it is staggeringly rich, yet displays more noticeable tannin than its younger sibling. Exceptionally ripe cassis fruit, the judicious use of toasty new oak, and a thrilling mineral character intertwined with the high quality of fruit routinely obtained by Las Cases, make this a compelling effort. There is probably nearly as much tannin as in the 1996, but it is not as perfectly sweet as in the 1996. The finish is incredibly long in this classic. Only 35% of the harvest was of sufficient quality for the 1995 Leoville-Las-Cases. Pure violets, minerals and blackberries on the nose. Full-bodied, chewy and powerful. Still holding back a lot.

Coming from the talented Thienpont team, the 2018 Château Puygueraud is a juicy, up-front, undeniably delicious 2018 offering lots of perfumed, floral, and violet notes, sumptuous blue fruits, medium-bodied richness, and a juicy, balanced, lengthy style that keeps you coming back to the glass. The balance is spot on, as is the purity of fruit, and it's ideal for enjoying any time over the coming decade. The blend is 85% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Franc and the rest Malbec.

1106,Craggy Range Winery Kidnappers Vineyard Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,Zealand,25,13,0.0,0,"This has gorgeous minerality with precise layers of crushed stones, white peaches, dried lemons, cedar, chalk and pie crust. Creamy with a medium to full body and bright acidity. Flinty and chalky layers hold long.  The Kidnappers Vineyard lies on the Hawke's Bay coast, making for a cooler site that's often picked a few weeks later than the warmer, inland Gimblett Gravels site. As a result, it is a completely different style. The 2021 Chardonnay Kidnappers Vineyard Hawke's Bay is all about precision and pizzazz, the bright, coastal site bringing vitality and tension. There's very little evidence of oak here in terms of flavor, allowing the pineapple, pear, honeydew melon and lemon brightness to shine. That said, the medium-bodied core offers weight and roundness, shaped by puncheon and only a small 10% in new barrel and left on lees. This is a wine that might not seem immediately impressive, but the raw material has the goods, and it's rather cleverly crafted, providing a finely structured account of itself. "
1107,Chateau Marsau,2018,Merlot,France,36,14.5,3.9,31,"Beautifully pure cherry, berry, black-olive and lightly toasted coffee-bean aromas follow through to a full body with a lovely center palate and purity of fruit.

Pure strawberry and raspberry are accented with wafts of lemon peel, wild mint, juniper and dried herbs, continuing to unfold as it airs in the glass. Medium-bodied, uber silky and fresh, it features concentrated berry fruits and a wave of herbal nuances across the long finish. Best After 2022 Muddled mulberry, plum and smoked sagebrush aromas entice the nose on this bottling. Vibrant and lovely purple fruit flavors are layered in oak and chaparral spice, but it's the vibrant acidity that leaves the complex palate wanting more. All destemmed and brought up in 45% new French oak. the 2020 Estate Pinot Noir Solomon Hills just about jumps out of the glass and is incredibly expressive and complex. Mulberries, ripe cranberries, sappy flowers, and incense notes all define the bouquet, and it's medium-bodied on the palate, with a supple, elegant mouthfeel, soft tannins, and a great finish. It leads with its pure fruit yet certainly doesn't lack complexity. I like it today, but this will benefit from just a year or so of bottle age and should have a decade of prime drinking. "

The palate plays a similar game, with a chalky, cool depth and smooth, pithy texture, contoured with freshness and subtle, oaky smoke. This refined and elegant combination will stand the test of time. Here too there is just enough reduction present to push most of the nose to the background though subtle notes of wood and white flowers are discernible. More interesting are the succulent yet nicely tension-filled flavors where the wood telegraphed by the nose is picked up by the solidly long finale. "

Intensely perfumed and richly structured with dark black fruits and concentrated tannins, it is set for seriously long-term aging. The power of the wine, based around the producer's Quinta da Vargellas, is magnificent. Drink this major Port from 2029. Remarkably harmonious already, with a beautiful display of unadulterated blueberry, blackberry and plum sauce flavors that fan out, while anise, ganache and cassis accents fill in.

1171,Boroli Barolo Brunella,2013,Nebbiolo,Italy,94,13.5,0.0,0,"This red is a tussle between sweet, ripe cherry and strawberry fruit, tobacco and mineral flavors and dense, aggressive tannins. Still restrained today, but the long finish of fruit and savory notes shows potential. Best from 2022 through 2042. The wealthy Boroli family acquired this property in the 1990s, but in recent years some vineyards have been sold off. Brunella in Castiglione Falletto is a monopole of the estate, and the wine is aged in both barriques and tonneaux. The nose is lifted and perfumed, with aromas of raspberries and dried herbs. It's velvety, concentrated and full-bodied, with polished tannins and delicate acidity. Sophisticated and stylish, with a long finish. Tasted twice - the first bottle did not show well. This is the first vintage of this new wine from Boroli. The 2013 Barolo Brunella is an austere and dry expression of Nebbiolo. Dried fruit, spice and licorice emerge from the bouquet. In the mouth, the wine is balanced, fresh and elegant. This is a very pretty cru expression with a long and clean finish. "
1172,SYLTBAR Mr.,Prosecco,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Italy,19,11.5,4.3,83,"COMMENTARY: Prosecco? What does name meant to us? Is this simply a light and breezy sparkling wine? Or is this in which we should stand up and take more seriously. I have down many glasses of these wines over the decades, and now see it has become more and more serious as a wine that should be at the top of our shopping list. The Syltbar (pronounced zult-bar or sit-bar) Il Concerto Prosecco is refreshingly delightful. TASTING NOTES: Bright, easy, and crisp and refreshing, this is a beautiful and fine bubbly. Its aromas and flavors of tart apples and brisk minerality followed by its crisp finish make it a perfect aperitif wine. For an added plus, this wine has only 49 calories per 6 ounces.

1173,Philipponnat Royale Reserve Non,Dose,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,67,12.5,0.0,0,"This wine manages to feel plump while remaining chalk-dry. The flavors are long on savory notes of white cornmeal, chamomile and bright, mouthfilling herbal freshness, riding on a texture rich enough to match with wild-mushroom risotto. The Non Dose in the name means the Champagne is completely dry. However the ripeness of the fruit in the blend is such that the wine's texture is generous and warm. That makes for a wine that is poised between a steely edge and ripe white fruits. Drink this bottling from 2023. Dry and harmonious, this feels like raw silk on the palate, with the creamy texture finely meshed with flavors of ripe green pear, preserved lemon, ground ginger and minerally chalk and oyster shell. Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Meunier.  "
1174,Andreola Col del Forno,Prosecco,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Italy,22,11.5,4.5,6,"From the Andreola lineup, the 2019 Valdobbiadene Rive di Refrontolo Brut Col Del Forno falls somewhere between the minerality of the 26° Primo and the spice of the Dirupo. Dusty potpourri, incense, dried apricots and ripe apple notes create an alluring display. It’s smooth and pliant, but with a stunning mix of zesty acids and minerals which add tension, as tart orchard fruits evolve toward the close. There’s a good amount of weight and concentration here, which leads me to believe that a year or two in the cellar may bring even further depth, as this finishes long with pretty inner florals. (Lot 20005) The aromas of ripe apples and perfumed minerals combine to give a delicious note of freshly sliced banana, spruced up by a fresh, creamy-mineral fizz and a persistent, minerally finish. Excellent Prosecco with some complexity. Enjoy now. "

Lieux-dits Semons, Lancement and Maison Rouge, all on the Blonde side. Mostly destemmed, matured in Stockinger foudres and barriques (25% new). Less aromatic and nuanced but more powerful than the 2019 version, the 2018 Cote Rotie Blonde du Seigneur is full-bodied, supple and rich, with ample black cherry and blackberry fruit, a velvety mouthfeel and a long, mouthwatering finish.

A blend of mostly Sangiovese with smaller parts Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and a touch of Alicante Bouschet, the Fattoria la Massa 2018 La Massa is a textured and softly pliable wine that shows gorgeous color saturation and a panoramic bouquet with black fruit, dried cherry, plum, spice and sweet tobacco. This vintage offered moments of heat and moments of coolness, and the whole approach is balanced quite nicely in this bottle. I give it a solid 10-year drinking window, and you get great value.

This 26,000-bottle release fits into that enviable school of Brunello that prioritizes tradition, elegance and purity. These are the basic traits of a great Sangiovese, but they are not easily achieved by all. Le Ragnaie's identity is deeply linked with these efforts. Lifted notes of dried mint or Mediterranean herb appear on the close. Le Ragnaie’s ‘entry-level’ Brunello wasn’t impoverished by the estate’s single-vineyard bottlings. It shows dried pressed violets and plump crushed cherry right out of the gate, with great purity. The tannins are firm and grippy, giving support to a substantial core and crunchy finish. This red offers a mix of cherry, strawberry, floral and earth aromas and flavors. Tips to the dry, dusty tannins in the balance, but overall this lingers with hints of fruit and a sense of grace. "

The 2009's nearly 14% natural alcohol, exquisite ripeness, and incredible complex bouquet of Asian spices, fruitcake, licorice, smoke, blackberries and black currants are to die for. A blend of 84% Merlot and the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, it possesses a viscous texture as well as a freshness and vibrancy that are remarkable given the wine’s weight, richness and potential massiveness. This extraordinary effort is one of the finest Vieux Chateau Certans made over the last sixty years. It will undoubtedly shut down in bottle, requiring a decade or more of cellaring. It should keep for 50 years thereafter. Proprietor Thienpont thinks it is a modern day version of the 1948. This shows gorgeous silk and polish, brimming with beguiling plum, cherry eau de vie and red currant fruit flavors laced with supple toasty vanilla and cedar hints. But in the background brews a darker side, with loam, maduro tobacco and iron notes, which take over on the finish authoritatively. This feels like it will get a lot bigger before it fully melds—and that will be a while. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2018 through 2035. "

The pale-white fruit holds mineral freshness in its depths of white-cherry and white-peach flavors. The acidity provides tension and limestone abrasion, while feeling completely integrated into the fruit. It’s a gripping cold-climate chardonnay for meaty game fish. This delightful Blanc de Blancs marries excellent depth of character – all the citrus, crisp pear and floral aromas of chardonnay – with charm. Properly dry, but very harmonious, thanks to the excellent balance of citrusy freshness and creaminess. Long, clean finish, accentuated by the lively mousse.

Offering up aromas of citrus oil, fresh peach, clear honey, white flowers and oyster shell, it's medium to full-bodied, pillowy and elegantly fleshy, with crisp acids, elegant mousse and chalky back-end grip. Amounting to some 130,000 bottles per annum, this is Gimonnet's largest cuvée by some margin. 100% Chardonnay. Didier Gimonnet’s aspiration for his entry NV is a cuvée with attack on the front, roundness in the middle and crispness on the end. The singular expression of his home village of Cuis, it is softened with reserves of the previous year’s blend, aged in magnums. The result is the quintessential aperitif, and one of the most pristine Champagnes for its price.

The lithe, elegant palate features juicy Marasca cherry, star anise and spearmint framed in polished tannins. It closes on a dollop of vanilla. Drink through 2029. "

Stunning balance on the palate for the quite challenging vintage, the ripeness and grapefruit freshness exactly matched, the finish so clean and straight. Drink or hold. The Cantina Terlano 2021 Alto Adige Gewürztraminer Tradition (with 100,000 bottles made) is a sweet and fragrant wine with heavy beeswax, sticky apricot and canned peach. Made only in stainless steel, the wine follows up with tighter aromas of cumin and saffron over a generous finish. Dried herb and white flower also appear. Best after 2022. "

Full body, firm and velvety tannins and a long and powerful finish. Needs five or six years to soften. Try in 2020. A beauty, with rich and supple plum and blackberry confiture notes that stream along over a dense but velvety structure. The licorice and toast aspect is more restrained here, and there are long, cool menthol, apple wood and earth accents through the finish. The 2012 Pavie celebrates its reclassification and upgrade to Class A St.-Emilion by sporting a new black label with gold print. Fortunately, every Pavie has benefitted since Perse began a complete makeover of this estate in 1998. From 47-year-old vines, the 2012 has an inky purple color, judicious toasty oak in the nose interwoven with copious blackberry and blackcurrant fruit, Christmas spices, as well as licorice and graphite. Full-bodied, rich and moderately tannic, it will require 5-7 years of bottle age but should drink well for 20-30 years. Kudos to Chantal and Gerard Perse for their extraordinary commitment to quality, which is so evident in this more challenging vintage than some of the great years like 2009 and 2010. "
1240,Dog Point Vineyard Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,Zealand,44,13.5,2.7,6,"This is very convincing, complex and downright impressive pinot noir. The intense aromas of ripe cherries and plums are framed in such intensely attractive oak spice and earthy, sous-bois complexity. The palate has regal, polished and powerful tannin and carries a vibrant core of very attractive, rich dark cherries. Not the flashiest or most flamboyant vintage for this wine, the medium-bodied 2017 Pinot Noir is taut and tight, with subtle notions of green rose hips entwined with white strawberries and tart raspberries. Endowed with silky tannins and ample concentration, it should improve over the next couple of years and drink well for up to a decade. "
1241,Alexander Valley Vineyards Zinfandel,2018,Zinfandel,California,21,14.9,4.4,5,"Supple and zesty, with vibrant, elegantly layered flavors of cherry and toasty spices that show a whiff of sassafras. Ends with a long, lively finish. A bright and floral zinfandel, this presents its purple fruit in a light and open frame. Red notes of pomegranate seeds and green scents of herbs show through the flavors, lasting with a sensation of the California sun in twilight. Serve it at cellar temperature to point up that cool feel. "

1245,Tenuta di Arceno Valadorna,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,Italy,63,14.5,0.0,0,"The celebrated 2016 vintage in Tuscany continues to impress. This Bordeaux blend is based on Merlot but has a slightly Left Bank style, and will soon become the estate's current vintage of Valadorna, due to be released this year. Aged in 60% new French oak, it is polished and intense, with bramble fruit, earthy balsamic tones, a milk chocolate aroma and a slightly herbal touch. Its tight-knit structure, combining crisp acidity and firm yet velvety tannins, makes this a powerful yet graceful wine. Even if you're not a fan of Tuscan Merlot, the tense character it gives to wines in the Chianti region is to be admired. Linear, fresh red with plum and orange-peel aromas and flavors. Medium body, light tannins and a fruity finish. Subdued and focused. This easy-drinking Bordeaux-variety blend offers rich dark-berry flavors laced with notes of smoke and soft herbs. "
1246,La Rioja Alta Gran Reserva 904 Tinto (1.5 Liter Magnum),2011,Tempranillo,Spain,169,13.5,0.0,0,"Lovely dried red fruit, such as plums with just a hint of prunes. Cedar, walnut and leather undertones. Full-bodied with lots of fruit, considering its age, as well as hints of smoke, tobacco, bark and black tea. Some balsamic at the finish. Traditionally styled with lovely results. Drink or hold. COMMENTARY: The 2011 La Rioja Alta Gran Reserva 904 highlights the beauty and complexity of the Tempranillo grapes. These vines—over 60 years old—offer excellent and persistent richness. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits juicy, ripe berries and wood notes in its aromas and flavors. Enjoy it with braised meat dishes. (Tasted: June 2, 2020, San Francisco, CA) Oak and red fruit nose. The palate has mouth-watering acidity, fine-grained/well-knit tannins and notes of citrus peel, spice and baked brambles. Long finish. I usually prefer the 904 to the 890, but there will be no Gran Reserva 890 until the 2010 vintage (from the last vintage I tasted, 2005). So, the only one of the extended-aging Haro-style reds I tasted this time was the 2011 Gran Reserva 904, which had a hard act to follow after the 2010 vintage. It's a blend of 89% Tempranillo and 11% Graciano matured in American oak barrels for four years, and it was racked eight times from barrel to barrel during its élevage, which sounds a bit harsh for a vintage like 2011 when the wines were not as complete and robust as in 2010. It has the classic profile, aromas and flavors (decayed leaves, tobacco, sweet spices, a meaty touch and some black fruit), but the oak seems to take a more leading role and the palate feels less juicy. It finishes dry. "

TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of savory spices, ripe fruit, and oak. Enjoy it with baked halibut in a cream sauce. (Tasted: May 9, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Grand in its complexity, this young Beaune already presents detailed layers of supple fruit and mineral power. The wine’s bright gold color glints in the same hue as the sun. Its clean Asian-pear and lemongrass flavors seem like they might be advanced; in fact, they are just precocious, as the wine holds its freshness for days, and sustains that initial complexity. This is compelling to drink now, and would be intriguing to cellar, to see what it might become. An elegant style, offering lime blossom, peach and honey aromas and flavors shaded by oak spice. Harmonious and fresh, ending with a light mineral element on the finish. Drink now. 20 cases imported. "

Extremely polished and balanced. Full body. Tight and balanced. Centered and racy. Needs three to four years to show it all, but already a beauty. Ripe berry aromas teeter on raisiny desiccation but manage to stay upright and firm without losing clarity and freshness. This single-vineyard reserva from a warm year feels bold and dense while benefiting from popping acidity. Flavors of mocha, black coffee, dark berry fruits and prune finish with drying tannins and firm acidity that indicate that this has more good years ahead of it. Drink through 2040. "

1252,Moone-Tsai Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,California,79,0,0.0,0,"The 2018 Chardonnay Napa Valley prances out of the glass with bold, showy pink grapefruit, fresh pineapple and ripe pears notes plus nuances of almond croissant, allspice and lime blossoms. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is gracefully constructed with layers of citrus and savory flavors, a silken texture and seamless freshness, finishing on a lingering zesty note. "
1253,Brancaia Chianti Classico Riserva,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,48,14,0.0,0,"A beautiful, floral wine with flowers, cherries and currants that follow through to a full body, round and juicy tannins and a flavorful finish. A big Chianti Classico, yet there’s freshness and form to it. Drink now. Brancaia’s Riserva combines fruit from estate vineyards in Radda and Castellina, though the plots vary from vintage to vintage. The final selection is made through tasting trials of separate lots conducted by owner Barbara Widmer and her team. The 2017 comes across as less oak-led than previous vintages and is fairly reserved. With coaxing, it divulges chocolate, mint tea, tobacco and forest berries. The tannins are still rather rigid and a tad dry, while the fruit is mellow and soft. Spiced plum pads out the palate and the finish brings in powdered cocoa notes. "
1254,Small Vines TBH Vineyard Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,89,13,0.0,0,"From the producer's own home estate planted in 2009, this is a gorgeous reckoning of minty sage, black tea and cool-climate hits of pomegranate and rhubarb. The tannins are strong and supportive and soften in the glass, showing graceful structure that complements the crisp, persistent acidity. A perfumed and layered nose of ripe red fruit, anise, fennel seeds and violets. Full-bodied with fine tannins. Expansive on the palate with juicy red and black fruit, dried herbs, ground spice and fresh flowers all melding together, without coming across as too dense or rich, but rather lifted and graceful. Structured, balanced and long. Seriously delicious. Showing exceptionally well now, but will continue to get better. Drink or hold. "

Medium-bodied with a solid core of fruit and a fresh and delicious finish. Classy tannins that are fine and textured. Such sophistication. Drink after 2027 and onwards. A wow wine. This is packed with cassis, loganberry and mulberry flavors that hint at the vintage's warmth, but this stays poised and fresh, with a sleek structure built on graphite and iron. Offers violet and lilac lift in the background and a groundswell of sweet tobacco, savory and singed cedar details that emerge through the finish, all with a fine-grained and rather luxurious feel.

1260,Tenuta San Leonardo San Leonardo,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,Italy,80,0,4.2,5,"Another year in bottle has added unexpected depths and dimension to the 2016 San Leonardo. It wafts up with an alluring bouquet of smoky black currant and plum skins, complicated by savory herbs, hints of white pepper and fresh tobacco. It's hard chiseled edges have formed into smooth contours now, velvety yet youthfully dense, washing mineral encased dark red and black berries across a core of brisk acidity as a combination of saline-minerals and grippy tannins add tension toward the close. This finishes incredibly long yet also structured, begging for time in the cellar, as hints of licorice and earth tones grumble under an air of inner violet florals. The potential within the 2016 San Leonardo is off the charts, yet it will require a good amount of time to come fully into focus. Bury your bottles deep. Drinking Window: 2026 - 2040. A very elegant, classic Bordeaux blend in the Italian context, but this is actually a special wine in any context, thanks to its subtlety and aromatic complexity. Blackcurrant, black-cherry and mint notes with just a hint of red bell pepper. Finely etched, medium-bodied palate with crisp tannins and lively acidity. The elegant tannins carry the long, cool finish. Drinkable now, but better from 2023. A lovely beam of black currant and fig cake flavors play off savory bay leaf and olive tapenade notes in this elegant, medium- to full-bodied red, which is fresh and focused, with good tension from a core of sculpted tannins. Long and fragrant on the creamy, mineral- and spice-laced finish. Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Merlot. Drink now through 2036. "

Expressive and incredibly succulent with subtle but driving acidity that pushes the palate through a persistent finish. Gentle tannins give structure and focus. Delicious. Sustainable. The 2019 Sémillon, one of my favorite cuvées from this producer, has a wonderful bouquet of peach skin and orange blossom scents, all extremely well defined. The balanced palate offers superb concentration on the entry, flavors of praline mixed with citrus fruit and almond, and an almost resinous note toward the finish. It’s tempting to drink this now, but it deserves 3–5 years in bottle. "

It remains a benchmark of the style. The color of cherry juice, it’s beautifully perfumed, with aromas of rose petals and white pepper atop earthier, meatier notes. Warm stone undertones back fresh squeezed raspberry, cherry and cranberry juice. In the mouth there’s a succulence to the brambly fruit that comes like the pop of a fresh red berry in the mouth. Crunchy acidity and the raspy power of sappy, fine tannins add structure and complexity. This is finely crafted and distinctly cool climate Aussie wine that drinks well now. Some wines have such distinct DNA. This is one of them. It packs so many layers of flavour and depth, yet never moves much beyond medium body. It smells of a souk market; spicy, peppery and exotic. It's replete with dark fruit, wood char and a touch of wintergreen. Raw silk tannins matched to a neat acid line give freshness, vibrancy and a promise it will last some distance yet. Effusive, polished and elegant, showing plush flavors of blood orange, raspberry and blueberry at the core, with details of Earl Grey tea, cumin, cloves and white pepper that linger on the long, expressive finish, where the tannins firm up.

With fruit from 50-year-old plants, the Le Ragnaie 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Ragnaie V. V. is one of three black-label special selections made by this estate. Instead of a Riserva program, Le Ragnaie focuses on territorial identity and single-vineyard expressions. This pretty wine shows the distinctive concentration that comes from the old vines, but that is also a result of the hot growing season. Dark fruit, rose, spice and baked clay emerge from this medium to full-bodied Brunello. At a cool 600 metres with a warm southwest exposure, Le Ragnaie’s oldest vines were planted in 1968. It seems to have more of everything in 2017. You can almost smell the warmth as wild blackcurrant and tar waft from the glass. It's a chewier expression than the rest of the estate’s single-vineyard bottlings, though the tannins still exhibit their signature tight austerity. Just a touch of dryness pokes through but there is plenty of fruit concentration to carry this as it assumes a more graceful gait. A sinewy version, featuring black cherry and black currant flavors enmeshed in dense, dusty tannins. Nonetheless, this is vibrant and fluid, staying focused through the long, chalky finish.

The full-bodied palate is light on its feet with juicy acidity and approachable grainy tannins, and it has a long, layered finish. Best After 2023. Grilled meat, bacon fat, tobacco and olives to the nose that follow through to a medium- to full-bodied palate with rich, creamy tannins. Tobacco, tar, dark chocolate, floral touches, bitter blood orange, scrubland herbs - so much going on the nose, really aromatic and expressive in a dark, sticky way. Gorgeously lifted and lively, full of bright and crunchy red fruits that you're just not expecting after the nose, this is direct but it has a pristine quality to it. Tannis are fine and the whole taste is just so clean. Juicy, mouthwatering and joyful, really bright and playful, I love the whole lifted tone, almost verging on tangy and sour but just keeps the depth. You get a bit of saltiness too on the finish. I like this a lot, especially the touch of metallic, iron-filing, blood on the finish. Characterful. The first vintage to use an optical sorted at harvest. Ageing 14 months in French oak (65% new and 35% in one year old). Starting off with the 2020 Optimus, it's a blend of 58% Syrah, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 11% Petit Verdot that spent 14 months in 65% new French oak. It displays a solid deeper purple hue to go with a peppery, darker berry, graphite, and smoky earth-driven bouquet. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has a round, supple, mouth-filling texture, quality tannins, plenty of mid-palate depth, and outstanding length.

1294,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,299,14.5,4.8,13,"On the spring day our panel tasted this wine, sitting outdoors, the breeze picked up as we approached this glass, and it seemed to cool down its intense concentration. As it turned out, that cool concentration stayed with the wine for days after opening, a structural component giving this the clarity and lively power of an epic Cask 23 vintage. Marcus Notaro finalized the blend at 52 percent from S.L.V. and 48 percent from Fay and aged it almost two years in new French oak barrels. The tannins are rich, the aroma smoky, but the bright liveliness of the fruit—the persimmon, the cherry and the fresh cigar tobacco—are the elements that shine through. Youthful and unevolved, this wine is an investment in the future, with patient cellaring required. This has a fresh, fruity nose of blackberries, small black cherries, mahogany, anise and crushed hazelnuts. It’s medium-to full-bodied with a creamy, silky texture. Seamlessly smooth, ripe tannins accompany velvety layers of ripe blue and black fruit. Wonderful now or in years to come. Better in 2023. Prior to the 1990 vintage, Cask 23 was a selection of the finest blocks of the SLV Vineyard. Then, with the acquisition of the neighbouring Fay Vineyard, this bottling transitioned into a blend of the finest parcels of both. This 2017 vintage (with 21 months in oak, as with both the single-vineyard bottlings) combines close to equal parts of the two sites, showing the brightness and energy of Fay with the brooding power of SLV. Aromas of coffee, clay and cedar precede a ripe but balanced palate and a long, driving finish. Drinking Window 2020 - 2045 Violet, cassis and blackberry puree notes form the bulk of this wine, while dashes of singed cedar and briar chime in throughout, with a tug of sweet earth at the very end. Still rather coiled up, so let this unwind with cellaring. Best from 2022 through 2035. "
1295,Poliziano Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,2018,Sangiovese,Italy,31,14.5,4.1,28,"Aromas of mulberry, plum, dried herb, chestnut and chocolate. Medium-to full-bodied with slightly rustic tannins and fresh acidity. Juicy, with a chalky texture and flavorful finish. Better from 2022. Aromas of cedar, toasted oak, violet and camphor come to the forefront on this savory red. On the concentrated but elegant palate, velvety tannins envelop ripe Morello cherry, fruitcake and licorice. Fresh acidity keeps it bright. "
1296,Alpha Estate Hedgehog Vineyard Xinomavro,2019,Xinomavro,Greece,24,14,3.9,41,"Gorgeous aromatics of pot pourri, wild strawberry and red cherry. Vibrant and bright with well-managed tannins, plenty of juicy and crunchy fruit and refreshing acidity. Pomegranate, wild red berries and flowers on the nose, following through to a juicy, medium-bodied palate with firm, dusty tannins. Very pristine and bright fruit profile, before a juicy, linear finish. Vegan. A very drinkable xinomavro. Uncork now The 2019 Xinomavro Hedgehog Vineyard was aged for 12 months in 50% new French barriques. It comes in at 14.02% alcohol. This feels a little delicate in the mid-palate, but it expands in the glass and coats the palate nicely eventually. Silky and bright, it has a fresh feel and a lively demeanor. The tannins are ripe here, not getting in the way too much, even with very young Xinomavro. The freshness is the biggest selling point. The acidity creates a juicy finish with the fruit lifted on the palate. This seems like a pretty nice Hedgehog this year. It should hold another decade or so, give or take. Xinomavro does not die easily. "

The 2019 Histoire d’A Pinot Noir was produced with grapes from a plot with shallow soils in the Adrianna Vineyard in Gualtallary, 1.75 hectares planted in 1998 with clone 115 at 1,350 meters in altitude. It fermented in 600-liter oak roll fermentors with 20% full clusters and matured in French oak barrels for 18 months. It's fresh and elegant but showier than the 2018, with notes of sour cherries and decayed violets. It's a fresh and elegant Pinot with very fine and chalky tannins. 4,560 bottles were filled in December 2020. From Gualtallary, Uco Valley, the 2019 Pinot Noir Histoire d'A was 20% fermented in whole bunches and spent 18 months in 1/3 new barrels. Light, refined garnet in hue. The complex nose is shaped by the variety and the aging process, offering notes of rose, sour cherry and damp earth alongside cinnamon and nutmeg. Intense in flavor, the palate is expansive but also finely grained and precise. An acidity lends vigor and lightness without affecting the silky, velvety feel. Ends with a lengthy finish in which the fruit takes charge, helped by the freshness. "

Readers should never overlook this type of wine, as the ability to blend from multiple sites gives winemakers incredible flexibility, and these wines can represent smoking values. Full-bodied aromas and flavors of currants, chocolate, lead pencil, and graphite emerge from this beauty, and it’s ripe, mouth-filling and balanced, with a great texture. It’s in the running for the best Napa Cabernet Sauvignon at the price point. Aromas of blackcurrants, hazelnuts, chocolate and violets follow through to a full body with round, creamy tannins and a pretty finish.

flavors. Full body, silky tannins and a long and flavorful finish. Rich plum and cassis with smooth texture and balanced flavors; clean, juicy and long. 12% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot, 4% Cabernet Franc. Blackcurrant and menthol aromas unfold onto generous rhubarb, charcoal and vanilla oak on the palate. It is sleek and supple with full fruit, but it is a little oaky now and needs time to integrate. Grgich Hills farms 62 acres of cabernet sauvignon, merlot and petit verdot at the north end of Yountville, on either side of Highway 29. Those organically farmed vines form the basis of this wine, with additional fruit from estate-grown vines in Rutherford and Calistoga.

A blend of Tannat, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Marselan from the Atlantic coastal region of Maldonado, this remarkably aromatic red has a perfume of chocolate, gingerbread, and plum. Roasted coffee and spiced blackberry are enhanced by a dry tannin structure, while the boldness of the wine is tempered by earthiness that arises mid-palate in a wash of blackberry.

1309,Le Ragnaie Casanovina Montosoli Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,159,0,0.0,0,"This is one of three black-label special selections made by Le Ragnaie. The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Casanovina Montosoli has a tonic and bright character with dark fruit flavors, blackcurrant and tarry smoke. The wine feels tightly knit and compact, but it takes on more volume and momentum, especially as it hits the palate. In fact, it ends on a long and polished note with some crushed limestone or dusty mineral. Located directly beside the cellar of the historic Baricci estate, Le Ragnaie’s Montosoli holding is a 1ha, east-facing plot at 300 metres above sea level. It impresses immediately, exhibiting enormous depth on the nose. Plums, violets and earthy truffle notes are backlit by bright cherry. The palate brings in nuances of orange and tar, while linear tannins are tightly wound and sandy in texture. The fruit is plentiful without being heavy, overripe or obvious. Finishing long and savoury this is one of the wines of the vintage. This red combines cherry, raspberry, earth, stone and sanguine aromas and flavors. Almost racy, with vivid acidity and dense, fine-grained tannins providing structure. This turns compact on the finish, yet should open up nicely in 2-3 years. "

This has pomegranate, red licorice and peppered raspberry. The fruit flavours, while slinky and seductive, are not the major player here. And that is saying something. The key to the brilliance of this wine, like the '14, the '10 and to some extent the '05 before it, is the texture. The tannins. They are tightly woven, very fine and serve to support the fruit and the acid. This wine is built on a stable scaffold of tannin that both cushions the experience and defines it. What a wine. A complex and layered nose of blackcurrants, fresh mint, pine cone and red licorice. Medium- to full-bodied with fine, structured tannins. Succulent and well constructed with a solid core of black fruit. Leafy herbs and black tea character add welcome depth. Delicious. So attractive right now but will age wonderfully. 97% cabernet sauvignon and 3% malbec. Dense and wonderfully juicy, with the tannic structure drawing you into a mix of intense cassis, huckleberry, clove, chai tea, dried black olive and smoked paprika.

Tangy and focused to begin, it unfurls from preserved lemon to plusher, perfumed orchard fruits, and it finishes with tremendous length and energy—this is a great candidate for the cellar.

1339,Chateau Palmer,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,384,14,4.4,18,"I am breathless with the dark-berry, lavender and burnt-orange aromas. Some salt. Just so formidable and deep. Stunningly sexy on the palate with a density and power, yet it leaves things so clean and bright. You want to drink it and enjoy it now, but it has the structure to last forever. Drink in 2022. Bottled relatively late in mid-September 2017, the 2015 Palmer is a blend of 44% Merlot and 50% Cabernet Sauvignon with a small portion of Petit Verdot. Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, it offers vibrant red currants, black cherries, wild blueberries, earth and mineral characteristics to begin, with slowly unfurling floral notes of violets and dried roses plus compelling baker’s chocolate and fragrant earth layers. Medium to full-bodied, generously fruited and possessing firm yet very, very fine-grained, mind-blowingly ripe tannins, the multifaceted palate features something of a skip in its step in terms of freshness, while it goes beguilingly earthy on the finish with some mineral hints. Very classy, elegant and sophisticated, this vintage is downright regal in its juxtaposition between poise and audaciousness. Think 2005 Palmer with a tick more fruit intensity, perfume and passion. One of the gems in Margaux is unquestionably the 2015 Palmer. Possessing more elegance and purity, as well as concentration, than the Alter Ego, it offers up a gorgeous bouquet of crème de cassis, caramelized cherries, charcoal, and graphite, with just a hint of spring flowers in the background. A final blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 44% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot that was brought up in 70% new oak, this full-bodied, ripe, incredibly polished 2015 is already hard to resist given its elegance and purity, yet should be at its best from 2023-2043. If you have more than one bottle, it's sensational today as well. This is dark and muscular in style, brimming with bramble, warm tar and paving stone notes that are matched by the deep layers of fig, blackberry and cassis fruit. A gorgeous bittersweet chocolate detail adds spine to the finish while violet and iron elements lurk in reserve. Another large wave of fruit and dark earth courses through the finish. Best from 2025 through 2045. It's very interesting to watch a 'super-second' risk scaling back the muscular attributes of its wine. The key, says director Thomas Duroux, was building the blend carefully and using the press wines to preserve the mid-palate (12% press in this wine, around the same as the 2015). It's less powerful and concentrated than the last few vintages, and yet the wine feels sculpted and sewn into place. The fine tannins are extremely clear and precise, and there's a purity of fruit expression that gives an overwhelming initial impression. The aromatics are really striking, offering an abundance of violet notes on the nose with huge finesse. It just gets better and better in the mouth,, and the tannins do that slow-build thing that is so disarming. This has clear ageing potential. Very low SO2 use for the past few years, in keeping with their biodynamic principles. Just one plot of Petit Verdot for the grand vin was hit by frost. Harvested 20-29 September. 11,000 cases of Palmer, representing 55% of the crop. "

Based on 75% Grenache, 10% each of Syrah and Mourvedre, with the balance Cinsault, it was partially destemmed and brought up all in foudre. This beauty just about jumps out of the glass with its Provençal aromatics of ripe cherries, ground pepper, saddle leather, garrigue, and spice. These carry to a medium to full-bodied wine that has the vintage’s charming, pure character front and center, yet still brings good mid-palate density and ripe tannins.

The archetype of Rancia in the past has been of a big, potent Chianti Classico but in 2018, Rancia is a wine of mind-blowing elegance and finesse. Silky, perfumed and indescribably finessed, the 2018 dazzles from start to finish. It's a magical wine in every way. This is really subtle and complex with cherry, herb, floral and sage aromas that follow through to a full body with firm, fine tannins that give form and energy to the wine. Racy and very fine. Drink or hold. The 2018 is an unusual vintage that shows an especially austere character. Off the bat, it must be said that the Fèlsina 2018 Chianti Classico Riserva Rancia would certainly benefit from more cellar time and a long drinking window. The Rancia is elegant and streamlined with a medium-bodied style that breaks from some of the more concentrated vintages we've seen in the past. The bouquet reveals a lot of dark or black character with blackcurrant, tar, resin, iron ore and a dusty hint of dry graham cracker (which reminds us of the vintage heat). Structurally, the wine offers a solid and firm footing, but it would benefit from further evolution. Aromas of French oak come to the forefront along with dark spice and botanical herbs. Mirroring the nose, the taut, linear palate features coconut, espresso and sage alongside dried cherry and orange zest. Tightly wound, close-grained tannins provide the backbone. Drink after 2024. "

A blend of 50 percent cabernet sauvignon with malbec, cabernet franc, merlot and petit verdot, this is a powerful wine, the fruit trending towards black plum juice. Its powerful acidity gives it enough lift, allowing some of the savory aspects to show through in the middle.

The fullness of the fruit is on full display, but in a very relaxed and natural manner. The wine never feels like too much. The tannins are yielding and velvety, and this purebred Tuscan red wraps thickly over the palate. It's poised for near- and medium-term drinking.

Well-balanced, dense, pure, layered, and rich, its big, rich style is similar to the 2003. This cuvee should keep for 25-30 years in a cool cellar.  The 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon Monte Bello comes from a warmer, generous year and is 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Petite Verdot, and the balance Cabernet Franc. It’s still youthfully colored and has classic Cabernet notes of crème de cassis, lead pencil, and vanilla oak. This medium to full-bodied effort is just now at the early stages of maturity and is silky, graceful, and elegant on the palate, with its still-present structure beautifully integrated into the wine. You can safely crack bottles any time over the coming two decades. Relatively open compared to the 2007 with sweet tobacco and plums and berries. Full body, velvety and gorgeous, with dried fruits, almost peaches, dark fruits. I love the finish. Why wait on this? But will improve with age wonderfully. Toasty oak shows more too. But it's so pretty. On the quiet side of intense, this vintage of Monte Bello is austere, delivering its fruit like a cool rain of berries. As a young cabernet, the flavors of black plum, dried currants and cranberries are held tight in the grip of oak. There's also a floral scent of roses before the tannins shut it down. This should plump up with a few years in the cellar, building on its elegance to match roast leg of lamb. "

1418,Yalumba The Octavius Old Vine Shiraz,2016,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,139,14.5,0.0,0,"This blend of Barossa Valley (67%) and Eden Valley fruit hails from five parcels averaging 80 years old, the oldest planted in 1854. Intensely concentrated in hue and muscular flavour. Spicy and mineral to the nose and palate, with glimpses of violets. Its iodine and liquorice-edged black cherry and blueberry flavour is succulent, but still in the grip of the sinewy, charry oak, making for an imposing, slightly austere finish. A powerhouse. Saturated ruby. Heady aromas of ripe dark berries, cherry liqueur, vanilla and incense, with smoky mineral and exotic spice accents building in the glass. Seamless in texture and deeply concentrated, offering palate-staining black and blue fruit, floral pastille and mocha flavors that turn sweeter with air. At once plush and lively, finishing extremely long and smoky, with repeating dark berry and floral notes and velvety tannins. There’s a stronger Barossa Valley expression in 2016 with ripe blackberry and dark-plum flavors delivering a very pure, focused fruit impression. Vibrant fruit purity here. The palate has gently grainy tannins and good weight. Fresh, succulent dark berries and an impressive, deep, driving finish. A blend of Barossa Valley 67% and Eden Valley 33 shiraz from very old vines. Drink or hold. For a wine named for the 90-liter barrels it was originally matured in, Yalumba's 2016 The Octavius displays relatively restrained oak. This vintage, only 50% of the volume aged in those small octaves for 20 months, with the rest in a mix of barriques and hogsheads (a mix of French and American), all of which were coopered at the winery—but only 28% of which were new. Cedar and vanilla notes accent mixed berries on the nose of this full-bodied effort, which comes from the Barossa (two-thirds) and Eden Valleys (one-third). Rich and velvety on the palate, it adds hints of dried spices, juniper berries and bay leaves on the long finish. The youngest vines were planted in 1951, the oldest in 1854. This is blended from vineyard parcels with an average age of 100 years, then aged in octaves – 100-liter barrels coopered from French oak at Yalumba. That small format oak gives the concentrated fruit an immediate richness, a fat wine bursting with cherry ripeness and the umami-tinged bitterness of flower petals. Stay with it and the cherry fruit turns plump and elegant, the wine’s richness shaped by fine tannins. This should age with grace. "

Try this with wild salmon. The NV Champagne Brut Nature Rosé is also 100% Pinot Noir and gets its pale pink hue from short maceration with the grape skins. It pops with fruity aromas of fresh raspberry, redcurrant, and crushed seashells, while the palate is more focused with citrus of grapefruit peel, pomegranate, and saltiness on the finish. It is a lovely, food-friendly rosé that would be fantastic with roast chicken. Best after 2022. The latest rendition of Drappier's emblematic NV Brut Rosé de Saignée is performing well, bursting from the glass with notes of red berries, plums, orange oil and ripe orchard fruit.

1430,Roots Run Deep The Graduate Cabernet Sauvignon,2016,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,150,15.5,0.0,0,"In 2017, Macario Montoya joined Mark Albrecht’s team at Roots Run Deep as winemaker, responsible for blending four different “Higher Education” cabernets. Each originates at a different block in the vineyard, which ranges in elevation from 1,700 to 2,000 feet; each is fermented with a different strain of yeasts and aged in different cooperage. This one spends its time in Seguin Moreau barrels, and the blend includes five percent each of malbec and merlot from Pritchard Hill; those factors tame the dynamic power of its mountain-grown tannins, yielding a trumpet blare of volcanic-soil intensity. Having tasted all four, this one struck our panelists as the most vibrant, layering red, yellow and orange-toned fruit in sunset colors, lasting on herbs, smoke and depths of earthy savor. It’s a complex wine, with all of its details aligned. Spiced plum, cedar and tobacco highlight a generously full-bodied, concentrated wine that’s deeply etched in tannin and oak.

The wine reminds me of St. Julien, with more acidity than Oakville and Rutherford.” Indeed, the high pitch of the fruit proves that point.

1540,Arrow & Branch Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,125,14.8,0.0,0,"All varietal from a mix of top sites (Lewelling, Dr. Crane, and Stagecoach), the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley sports a vivid purple color to go with terrific cassis and blueberry fruits, full-bodied richness, a rounded, elegant mouthfeel, and solid notes of smoke tobacco and toasted spice. It’s going to gain a touch more complexity with short-term bottle age and keep for 15-20 years. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Black Label is deep garnet-purple in color and features wonderfully pure, vibrant notes of fresh, ripe blackberries, red and black currants and boysenberries plus suggestions of violets, dark chocolate, unsmoked cigars and pencil shavings. The medium to full-bodied palate coats the mouth with lively black and red fruits, supported with ripe, grainy tannins and bold freshness, finishing long and earthy. "
1541,Luigi Baudana Barolo Cerretta,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,109,15,0.0,0,"This is really perfumed and enticing, offering intense floral and citrus character with some cherry. It’s full-bodied, yet tight and very reserved, with a long, racy finish. Fantastic depth of fruit here. Outstanding purity, too. Better in 2025. This red boasts a beautiful balance between its cherry, strawberry, floral, eucalyptus and mineral aromas and flavors. Supple and elegant, despite the resonant tannins and lively acidity that boost the lingering aftertaste, with fine length. Don’t think about pulling the cork for five years. Forest floor, prune, leather and pipe tobacco aromas make their way to the forefront. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's full-bodied and concentrated, offering cherry marinated in spirits, licorice and the warmth of evident alcohol. Tightly knit, enveloping tannins provide firm, velvety support. Drink 2025–2032. Fresh violet scents lead into flavors of crunchy cherry and seeded blackberry, all layered with notes of bitter chocolate. The wine finishes on lingering notes of warm spice, and its taut tannins will benefit from several years in the cellar. A release of 3,000 bottles, the Luigi Baudana 2017 Barolo Cerretta is the most downplayed of these three wines and the least complicated from an aromatic point of view. A first wave of aromas is focused on wild rose and crushed flowers. More robust tones of ripe cherry, rusty earth and dark spice follow in time. This edition of Cerretta is surprisingly delicate and fine, going against almost everything we know about robust fruit from Serralunga d'Alba and the powerful 2017 vintage. The wine is counterintuitive in a way only Nebbiolo can be. "

TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits aromas and flavors of black fruit, dried herbs, and licorice. Enjoy it with a well-seasoned, oven-baked Porchetta. (Tasted; July 26, 2021, San Francisco, CA) In the late 1980s, Domaines Barons de Rothschild took over the Los Vascos estate in the Colchagua Valley of Chile. This Cabernet Sauvignon Gran Reserva seriously over-delivers for its $22 SRP. Dark fruit notes of black currant and blackberries make way for secondary and tertiary notes, including spice rack, cigar box, and vanilla. Marked earthiness, cracked black pepper notes, and well-integrated (though prevalent) tannins add to the layers of complexity. Serve this wine with a simply grilled steak. Spicy berry and plum aromas are easy to process and easy to like. A fresh and healthy palate has lift to its step, while this tastes of saucy, savory berry fruits that show earthy complexity as this unfolds. A spicy, solid finish confirms quality. "

(Tasted: September 26, 2022, San Francisco, CA) A wine with grace and tension, this opens with pretty violet aromas that lead to vibrant, steely raspberry and guava flavors accented by forest floor and spices. Ends with refined, mineral-tinged tannins. Aromas of strawberries, spices and flowers follow through to a medium body with a firm and slightly chewy mouth-feel and a delicious finish.

Alex Beloz blends his top cellar selection for his club members, incorporating fruit from all three climate zones of the estate. The wine includes petit verdot and petite sirah (8 percent each) grown at the
highest point in the vineyards, above the fog line at 2,640 feet—a half mile above sea level. The cabernet selections range from vines at 2,300 feet up to the high point, the blend aged in Hungarian oak barrels (75 percent new). This is a beautiful mountain wine from Lake County, its fruit tart without being sour, its red-currant astringency and fresh plum skin tannins providing refinement to the structure. Firm and juicy in its stance, light and airy in its delivery, this is well worth a place in your cellar. Aromas of blackberries, dark cherries, plums, sweet spices and pine cones. Hazelnuts, too. It’s full-bodied with chewy tannins. Fleshy, with a creamy, flavorful finish. Drink from 2023. "
1552,Donatella Cinelli Colombini Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,79,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is balanced and bright with lots of luscious primary fruit. The wine opens to soft tones of cherry, dried raspberry, crushed flowers and spice. It moves over the palate with mid-weight intensity, imparting plenty of Sangiovese freshness along the way. A dense, solidly built red, with wild herb, eucalyptus and soy aromas enveloping the core of cherry and plum fruit. Balanced and lingers nicely on the fruity, savory and tobacco-tinged aftertaste. Best from 2025. Sweet berries and dried flowers with cedar and sandalwood. Medium-to full-bodied with chewy yet fine tannins that are long and persistent. It’s a little tight at the end, suggesting that another two or three years of bottle age will give it a little more open and refined character. Try after 2023. "
1553,Fess Parker Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,52,14.5,0.0,0,"Elegant aromas of cassis, lavender and violet are offset by earthy potting soil scents on the nose of this bottling. Lovely layers of flower, fruit and spice erupt on the palate, which is wrapped in delicate but persistent tannins. This straightforward Sta. Rita Hills wine delights with its dark and spicy scents—cola and black raspberries, cinnamon, earth and a bit of sassafras. The flavors are broad and sumptuous, a concentrated, spicy succulence that’s buoyed by robust acidity. Power chords, for thinly sliced tri-tip. The 2019 Pinot Noir Fiddlestix Vineyard is a darker, more earthy effort that still brings plenty of freshness in its bright cherry, candied strawberry, and sappy flower-like aromas and flavors. As with many of the 2019s from Fess Parker, it has a focused, firmer style on the palate that’s going to benefit from a year or two in the cellar. "

A blend of Grand Cru fruit, this well-structured wine is rich while also tense, mineral and with further aging potential. Citrus acidity is allied to crisp apples to produce the fruity side of this well balanced wine. It will be better from 2020. "
1556,Kay Brothers Hillside Shiraz,2017,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,75,14.5,0.0,0,"Gamey and rich, this is a fully oaked shiraz with staying power. The blueberry flavors feel a little loose and soft, but the tannins keep it in a clean, tight and spicy line that benefits from several days of air. Cellar this for a year or two before decanting with grilled lamb kabobs. Aromas of red-plum compote and creamy baking spices abound here. The oak is assertive, but the fruit laps it up on the palate with a smooth, spicy-plum core. "

Very suave. Drink now. From one of my favorite estates, the 2019 Vacqueyras Tradition offers up a beautiful bouquet of ripe cassis and blackberry fruits as well as violets, spring flowers, and peppery herbs. Most 2019s are rich and opulent, but this holds onto a wonderful sense of purity and elegance, with medium to full body, integrated acidity, ripe tannins, and a great finish. It’s a no brainer purchase. The blend is 44% each of Grenache and Syrah, with the balance Mourvèdre. "

Wonderful depth, due to the compact fruit and vertical line of tannins. Black pepper to the dark fruit. Better in two or three years. Try after 2022. Chewy, dry tannins are armed with graphite and espresso. With muscle and grace, this red made from the iconic grape of Uruguay stars in a balanced narrative interweaving bold blackberry and an earth-laden sense of place. Chocolate and sandalwood appear on the finish. This is a ripe version of Tannat, with earth and blackberry aromas leading the charge. Toasty dark-fruit flavors benefit from integrated oak, while this tastes peppery on the finish. The palate shows a lot of grip, so it’s best to serve this with meat. Drink through 2025. Aromatic, smoky with lots of spice, leather and some tobacco. Solid, peppery, delicious and serious. Polished tannins with lovely texture. A supple, Atlantic red, this is a generous take on tannat with its bright flavors of cranberries and thyme. The tannins have the succulence of ripe plum skins, with a dark rose scent that lasts. Delicious with thick-cut lamb chops off the grill. "

1576,Emilio Hidalgo La Panesa Especial Fino,Sherry,Sherry,Spain,70,15,0.0,0,"“Fino Amontillado” is a style of Sherry that’s virtually extinct. It was made from old wines that had almost lost their flor and had begun to oxidize, their color darkening as they gained depth and complexity. Although La Panesa is not, strictly speaking, a Fino Amontillado, it has the characteristics of those wines from the past. With an average of 15 years of aging in solera (ten more than most Finos), it takes the lifespan of flor to the limit, creating a wine that’s intoxicating in its mineral and dried-fruit fragrance. Bone dry, saline flavors drive the wine from beginning to end, their abundance leaving no room for sweetness. This is the definition of verticality and elegance. The Fino La Panesa N/V is a reference for old Fino, pushing the limits of biological aging. Bottled at an impressive old age of 15 years from a solera created in 1961, it shows a deep golden color and a nose full of dried nuts (hazelnuts), elegant, complex and balanced, with intense salinity, pungent flavors, a full, wide palate and great length. This is a superb example of how to control the power of very old, biological Sherries. As with most of the NV wines, its impossible to distinguish the different bottlings so it""s hard to give a drinking window, because you""ll not know how old the bottle you have is, but the wine has the stuffing to last and even improve for a good five years. This is one of the greatest Finos in existence today."" This small producer in Jerez does not seek publicity but is worth tracking down. All the wines are excellent and several exceptional. The complex La Panesa is one for the grown-ups, at the very limit of flor ageing, at an average 15 years old. Shows lots of range, featuring singed persimmon, dried nectarine, walnut and green tea notes, with a long bitter almond note on the finish. A big fino with invigorating acidity. Tan in color and elegant beyond what's normal, this high-end fino shows full, complex aromas of honey, citrus, rancio, dried gouda cheese and nuttiness. It feels both easy and fresh, with dry, intense flavors of citrus and almond. Long and smooth on the finish, with zero burn or bite. "

Sweet red berries, crushed flowers, licorice and tobacco are some of the notes that flow from this understated Pinot. The Ryan Vineyard is already a touch forward, suggesting it is best enjoyed sooner rather than later. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2018. This bottling is always silky and accessible on release, and so it is with the 2008.

Full-bodied, the palate is packed with layered black and blue fruits, framed by ripe, velvety tannins and plenty of freshness, finishing long and with great purity. A tight, compact red with lots of chewy tannins, yet they are polished and poised. Full body. Savory with blue fruit at the end. A blend of 85% merlot, 8% cabernet franc and 7% cabernet sauvignon. Needs time to come together. Better after 2022. This is enticing, with a succulent core of crushed plum, blackberry and dark currant fruit that melds nicely with apple wood and sweet tobacco notes. Shows a good brambly tug through the grippy finish. Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Best from 2021 through 2032. Knitted down, with a creep of limestone and scraping minerality that peels the layers back slowly. This suggests confidence and is going to age well. Not exactly seductive today, but there is bitter black chocolate on display, precise cassis, plenty of tannins and a fresh backbone. Drinking Window 2025 - 2042. Powerful tannins dominate this massive wine that has as much to do with structure as with dark black-fruit flavors. Dense and concentrated, it will age well and should be drunk from 2023. "
1585,Chateau Mont-Redon Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2018,Rhone Red Blends,France,55,13.5,0.0,0,"The base wine, the 2018 Châteauneuf Du Pape has a healthy ruby/purple color to go with its classic Southern Rhône notes of ripe red and black fruits, lots of earthy garrigue, some ground pepper, and a touch of minerality. All this carries over to the palate, where the wine is medium to full-bodied and beautifully balanced, with a great mid-palate and sweet tannins. It certainly shows the upfront, charming style of the vintage, but I love its mid-palate, it’s beautifully balanced, and is just a seriously classy wine from this estate, which deserves more recognition today. Enjoy bottles any time over the coming 15 years or more. Dark and winey, with waves of ganache, steeped plum, blackberry reduction and melted black licorice rolling through. The finish is scored with warm earth and smoldering tobacco notes, showing ample grip for the cellar. Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre, Counoise, Muscardin, Vaccarèse and Cinsault. "

1587,Hermann J. Wiemer Dry Riesling,2020,Riesling,U.S.,21,12,3.9,17,"Beautiful fresh-pineapple aroma with hints of yellow grapefruit zest, candied lemon and graphite. Excellent balance of stone-fruit juiciness, medium body and citrusy freshness. Quite a compact mid-palate, then an impressive finish with mineral tension and a graphite note.  The 2020 Dry Riesling comes in with seven grams of residual sugar and 12.1% alcohol. This is a blend of vineyards, often a very good value in the somewhat pricey lineup. It is again. This year, in its youth, it has a touch of sugar around the edges, a friendly feel and a lush finish. It doesn't have the steely hints that, relatively speaking, the 2019 could sometimes project, granting that they are not here together. They look the same on paper, but at least from recollection, they are at least a little different in style, feeding into the stereotypes of the 2019/2020 vintage styles. There is certainly reasonable acidity on the finish here with some tension cutting the fruit and sugar, but this is firmly in the friendly puppy style. If someone told me it was close to a semi-dry, I wouldn't necessarily have been shocked. Best After 2022 "
1588,Chateau Berliquet,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,44,14.5,4.0,40,"Love the combination of dark berries, sweet tobacco and wet earth here. Full-bodied, juicy and chewy with lots of tannins, solid fruit concentration and a medium finish. A blend of 75 per cent merlot and 25 per cent cabernet franc. Try in 2023. Medium to deep garnet-purple in color, the 2016 Berliquet (blended of 75% Merlot 25% Cabernet Franc) is a little mute to begin, opening out to expressive kirsch, black plums and black cherry compote scents plus nuances of unsmoked cigars and dried herbs. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has fantastic intensity and energy, with a firm frame of ripe, grainy tannins and a lively lift to the mineral-laced finish. Packed with spice, blackberry and black plum, this is generous, yet balanced by refined acidity and dense tannins that will give it a chance to age over the medium term. It is an apt and attractive reflection of the vintage. From a site near Canon, just down from Beau-Séjour Bécot, the 2016 Château Berliquet is a plump, rounded, medium-bodied Saint-Emilion with classic red and black cherry fruits, hints of leafy herbs and earth, and a charming, balanced feel that’s very much in the style of the 2016 vintage. A blend of 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc, brought up in 50% new oak, it will put a smile on your face any time over the coming 10-15 years. "

1590,Laurel Glen Counterpoint Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,54,14.5,0.0,0,"Crisply focused in currant, dried herb and cedar, this is a classically structured red that is vibrantly approachable and ample to drink in its youth. With just 30% new French oak, it delivers forested earthiness and high-toned freshness that complement each other well for a very fair price. Offers a tasty mix of gently mulled blackberry and red currant fruit flavors, laced with subtle herb and iron accents along the way.

A gentle vintage of Counterpoint, this estate selection has the warm-cool balance of Sonoma Mountain cabernet. It’s foresty with scents of bay and wild blueberry sweetness. Then the tannins come up to subdue that fruit for now. Give it a year in the cellar, then decant it for lamb chops. "

Fantastic relative value. 80% merlot and 20% cabernet franc. Drink after 2025. This estate has been delivering the goods for numerous vintages now, and the 2019 Château Tour Saint Christophe is another terrific wine. Ripe black cherries, black raspberries, graphite, new leather, and chalky minerality all define the nose, and it's medium to full-bodied, has a tight, straight, focused texture, ripe yet present tannins, and outstanding length. It doesn't have the mid-palate density or opulence of the 2018, but it’s more pretty, focused, and straight on the palate. Give bottles 4-5 years and enjoy over the following two decades. Best After 2026 From clay-rich soils opposite Troplong Mondot in the commune Saint Christophe des Bardes, the 2019 Tour Saint Christophe offers up demonstrative aromas of cherries, wild berries, sweet loamy soil, licorice and dark chocolate. Full-bodied, rich and fleshy, with an enveloping core of fruit, lively acids and ripe, powdery tannins, it's a strong effort in a crowd-pleasing style. Best after 2021. "

Disgorged autumn 2018. Drink now through 2028. Grand cru grapes from the Côte des Blancs give this Champagne great intensity and texture. While the bottling is still a little young, it does have hints of the richness of maturity that will shine through the white fruits and lemon flavors. Best after 2021. Bertrand Lilbert makes this wine from the first pressing of the fruit he grows at estate parcels in three Côte des Blancs villages. It’s a blend of three vintages aged three years on the lees. The fragrance is gingery, with the springtime scent of blossoms in an heirloom-apple orchard. The structure is austere, with tense acidity leading through an elegant finish. Skinny for now, this will grow ample and accommodating with bottle age. "

Rich, medium to full-bodied, beautifully polished, it's another beautiful, elegant wine from this estate that does everything right. Dried cedar with chocolate, iodine and black fruit. Medium body, round and soft tannins and a delicious finish. So delicious. A blend of 59% merlot, 39% cabernet franc, 1% petit verdot and 1% malbec. The 2016 Uriah begins with a firm, focused core of dark red and black fruit on the nose, with purple flowers and soft oak spices that waft subtly out of the glass. The medium to full-bodied palate has some strict tannins that grip with complexity across the mid-palate. The tight core is well-balanced, with a seamless expression of soft, dusty cherry skin and black plum essence that lingers long on the finish. If you haven't tried this wine, it's time to give it a try! The aromas are reticent, opening to reveal appealing notes of fresh and dried herbs. Lighter-styled chocolate and coffee flavors follow, fleshing out with time open. At present it's hard to get at, but there is a lovely sense of freshness to it and good stuffing that augurs well for its future. Plush and elegantly expressive, with black cherry, sweet anise and espresso flavors that glide toward polished tannins. Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. "

1748,Quinta de Chocapalha Red,2016,Other Red Blends,Portugal,16,14,3.9,34,"The blend of mainly grapes normally associated with Douro wines has produced a rich, dense wine. Firm tannins still show strongly, but they are balanced by the succulent blackberry fruits. The wine, serious and concentrated will age further, so drink from 2022. The 2016 Tinto is a blend of 45% Touriga Nacional, 20% Tinta Roriz, 15% Touriga Franca, 10% Castelão and 10% Alicante Bouschet, all aged for 18 months in used French oak. It comes in at 14% alcohol. Elegant in the mid-palate, this still shows plenty of concentration, thanks to its intense fruit flavor. It is downright sappy on opening. The wood needs to be pulled in a bit, but this is otherwise super, another fine bargain at the non-Reserve level from the winery. With aeration, it expands in the glass, becoming fatter and more powerful. More importantly, it also becomes more expressive. The grapes show more personality, and you can taste hints of complexity to come, a medley of ripe red fruits, some beefy nuances, earth, and so on. The tannins are ripe, but the fruit is so unevolved that this plainly could use a year in the cellar, at least. It should age well, perhaps better than anticipated, so there is no need to rush. It is vaguely approachable but certainly not showing all it has today. "

Evolves across the palate, building to a tightly wound tapestry of fruit, mineral and balsamic elements on the finish. Best from 2023 through 2045. The Schiavenza 2016 Barolo Broglio is a generous and open-knit expression that unfolds to dark fruit, ripe cherry, spice, cola and aniseed. This expression makes room for warmer notes of smoked bacon or tilled earth. Those aromas seem to reflect a savory quality inherent to the fruit or winemaking rather than any ripeness from the vintage. In fact, those savory tones quickly cede to bright and tonic fruit flavors and a good dose of tingly acidity. Fragrant blue-flower, ripe plum and baking-spice aromas mingle with new leather. Full bodied and enveloping, the concentrated palate doles out mouthfuls of ripe Marasca cherry, raspberry jam and licorice cushioned in velvety tannins. Drink 2023–2028.

With medium to full-bodied richness, a beautifully balanced, elegant texture, and a solid spine of acidity, this is another terrific white from this team that has loads to love. Bright yellow-plum and pear flavors are leesy and silken on the palate of this full-bodied yet fresh blend of Grenache Blanc (53%), Clairette (22%) and Viognier (11%). It's a pure-fruited dry white anchored by crisp lemon acidity and a finish dusted with hints of white pepper and nutmeg. At peak now, the wine is likely to hold through 2025 Inviting, with a shortbread note leading off, followed by verbena, white peach and star fruit flavors.

As with its 2018 sibling, this has typical peach and apricot nuances. It shows off a lot of sugar. Part of that extra richness over the 2018 may be the perception created by this being a year younger, to be sure. For today, I like the balance on the 2018 better and give that the nod. This might well catch up in time. The difference between the two is not particularly great, despite rather different vintages. With 245g/L residual sugar at bottling, the aromas erupt from the glass, with notes of marmalade, candied pineapple and sugared citrus rind.

First nosings pick up exotic herbal aromas that are delicately sweet and botanical; later passes reveal deeper, more complex scents of autumn woods, mulled wine and holiday spices. In the mouth, it’s sweet, sour and spicy at entry; by midpalate the range of flavors runs from nutmeg to quinine to muscat grapes to orange rind. Aftertaste is long.

1795,Lucien Albrecht Grand Cru Pfingstberg Pinot Gris,2015,Pinot Gris/Grigio,France,35,12,3.6,8,"Ripe, juicy yellow pear and honey carry the nose.

The result is a rounded, powerful and concentrated wine. "

Medium to full-bodied, it's a bit open-knit in texture but offers plenty of flavor and length. Enjoy it over the next few years. Best After 2021 "

1798,Bodegas Muga Prado Enea Gran Reserva (1.5 Liter Magnum),2015,Tempranillo,Spain,209,14.5,0.0,0,"The most classical of their wines, the 2015 Prado Enea Gran Reserva is a blend of Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo and Graciano, mostly from Rioja Alta (Sajazarra, Cellorigo and Fonzaleche), but the Garnacha is from different plots in the zone of Tudelilla at high altitude. These grapes are always picked last, but the wine has a similar alcohol level as the rest, around 14.5% in a warm year like 2019. The modus operandi is similar to other of the top cuvées—harvested into 200-kilogram boxes, destemming, optical sorting and fermentation in small oak casks with indigenous yeasts. The élevage in this case is extended to 36 months, and the barrels are only 10% new. This is, year in, year out, my favorite wine from Muga, and in this powerful and ripe year, these late-harvesting vines ripened thoroughly and delivered a full array of aromas and flavors so that the wine has plenty of depth and complexity. It has a very classical profile, with incipient tertiary notes, perfumed, floral and rich, textured and beautifully balanced. They compare this 2015 with 2009 and 2005 in terms of style but with freshness in the style of 2001 and 2010. It's enjoyable but should also develop for a long time in bottle. One of the finest Prado Enea vintages. Reserved and polished, this is a Prado Enea with great class and focus. It’s so aromatic,with plum, peach, cherry and cedar character. Salted olives, too. Medium-to full-bodied with very fine tannins and a long, fresh finish. Elegance with power here. Give it three or four years to open, but already impressive. The 2015 Prado Enea Gran Reserva comes from a hotter, riper vintage, but it shares similar gamey, exotic aromatics of red and black fruits, sappy herbs, flowers, leather, iron, and background cedary oak. Rich, medium to full-bodied, incredibly pure, and balanced, it has ripe, still present tannins, impeccable balance, and a great finish. This is a classic expression of this cuvée that can be enjoyed any time over the coming two decades or more. Well-tailored in an understated way, this harmonious red is plushly creamy on the palate, like fine cashmere, showing seamless integration of the sculpted tannins with finely detailed flavors of black cherry and black plum reduction, sandalwood, cedar, green olive, espresso crema and minerally smoke and iron. Long and lightly juicy on the refined finish. Tempranillo, Graciano, Mazuelo and Garnacha. "

1800,Clos Du Val Yettalil,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,199,14.5,0.0,0,"A Bordeaux-inspired blend, the 2019 Yettalil Red Wine is considerably darker, deeper and richer than the Napa Valley Cabernet. Scents of cassis, pencil shavings, loam and mocha all appear on the nose, while the full-bodied palate is expansive and velvety without getting jammy or overly broad. Perhaps most important, for a wine that will presumably be consumed along savory dishes, it's nicely savory itself, with earthy notes and gentle tannins punctuating the long finish. A dense nose of blackcurrant, woody spice and crushed blackberry. Full-bodied and rich. Slightly chewy tannins. Vanilla and toasted herbs on the cozy, plush palate. Nicely balanced and intense. Really pure dark-fruit character. Best from 2024. Reserved but ample nose of violet, crushed stone, black cherry, blackberry, bramble. Young and vibrant, going to develop into something lovely. Shows solidly ripe plum, cassis and cherry preserves, which have a loamy edge to them while maintaining nice definition through the tobacco- and cedar-accented finish. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Drink now. Tangy and dry in cranberry and blackberry, this structured, ageworthy wine combines a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Given 16 months in a majority of new French oak, it is full bodied and dense, with strong notes of toasted oak and grippy tannin. Enjoy best 2029–2034. "
1801,Laurent-Perrier Alexandra Rose,2004,Sparkling Rosé,France,350,12,0.0,0,"Disgorged in 2012 after eight years sur lattes, the 2004 Brut Alexandra Grande Cuvée Rosé has really begun to develop some complexity after seven years on cork. Salmon-pink in hue, the wine wafts from the glass with a beautiful bouquet of blood orange, iodine, dried rose petals, aromatic bitters and tangerine. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, pure and racy, with a delicate pinpoint mousse, good concentration at the core and a long, saline finish. Readers who have had the foresight to cellar a few bottles should pop a cork or two, as this rosé is showing brilliantly. Aromas of peaches and light cherries with rust and hints of grapefruit. Earth and spice undertone. Full-bodied, fruity and spicy. Hints of black pepper. Extremely bright and creamy texture. Delicious and delicate finish. First produced in the 1987 vintage to celebrate the marriage of owner Bernard de Nonancourt's eldest daughter, this bottling is now mature. Ripe, it still retains plenty of red fruits while also allowing the toasty character to show through. It's a rosé that calls for food, a rich and balanced wine that is just perfect to drink now. Laurent-Perrier's flagship rosé is a blend of 80% Pinot Noir and 20% Chardonnay from Grand Cru vineyards, and has been bottled only seven times since 1982. Dried flowers, rose petal, strawberry and spices appear on the succulent and elegant bouquet. There’s an engaging counterpoint between vinosity and minerality on the palate, with plenty of freshness. Michel Fauconnet macerates pinot noir and chardonnay together (an 80-20 blend), allowing the color of pinot’s skins to tint the wine, while the chardonnay skins add to the wine’s structure, tightening the red fruit in a delicate tannic vise. There’s a wild mushroom savor to the wine, a gamey, woodland note and a minty crispness. Youthfully brash, then nuanced and satisfying, this is substantial enough for the dark meat of roast game birds. Aromatic notes of smoke and mineral herald this rich rosé Champagne, leading to a finely meshed mix of dried white cherry, toasted almond, spring forest and orange peel, carried on a soft, pearled bead. Fresh, with lightly mouthwatering acidity firming the fruitcake-laced finish. "
1802,G.H. Mumm Brut Grand Cordon with Red Velvet Gift,Bag,Mixed Collections,Other,59,0,0.0,0,"This super, non-vintage cuvée has plenty of lemons and guava on the nose with some flinty reduction. The palate has a richer, sweeter feel and delivers peach and melon flavors, in an accessible mode.

A burst of sweet red/purplish fruit, cedar, spice, mint and tobacco infuses the 2017 with striking depth and layers of complexity.

Lenoble Blanc de Noirs Premier Cru Extra Brut,2013,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,89,12.5,0.0,0,"From the village of Bisseuil, east of Épernay, this Pinot Noir is tightly structured and richly fruity. Its low dosage emphasizes the Champagne's red-apple fruitiness while also opening space for the taut texture and fine acidity. A little young, this vintage wine will be best from 2022. Very spicy, with white pepper and cloves highlighting the pomegranate and flint character. It’s medium-to full-bodied with a solid core of fruit and tension. 100% pinot noir. Dosage 2g/L. Drink now.

Dark-fruited with pleasant herbal and spicy complexity. Slightly dry finish. Best after 2023. Consistently holding to themes of black cherries and dried plums sweetened with a well-measured dollop of oak and showing touches of background dried herbs, Darioush’s latest is a fairly weighty, fully ripened Cabernet Franc of admirable richness and depth, but it is also a young, moderately tannic wine that, despite its initial sense of suppleness, shows the structural firmness of one that very much argues for additional time. It is sure to find the polish it now lacks with another three or four years on the cork, and another full decade of positive growth looks to lie well within its reach. "

1810,Vinedos de Paganos El Puntido Gran Reserva,2008,Tempranillo,Spain,89,14,0.0,0,"I was greatly impressed by the 2008 El Puntido Gran Reserva, a wine with a more traditional profile than the majority of wines from the Eguren family. At age 14, the wine is glorious, still young and with a mixture of primary and more developed notes. It goes more in the direction of the old wines, with balsamic notes of incense and cedarwood, mushrooms and some berries and herbs. It's complex and elegant, with fully resolved tannins. This was bottled back in May 2011, so it's been in bottle for over a decade, and the texture shows it. Aromas of sweet berries, tree bark and crushed stones follow through to a medium body with round, creamy tannins and a delicious, succulent finish. Shows complexity and subtlety. "
1811,Chateau de Nalys Chateauneuf-du-Pape Grand Vin,2016,Rhone Red Blends,France,99,14.5,4.2,20,"Destined to become Nalys's new flagship (unless the white version steals the show), the 2016 Chateauneuf du Pape Grand Vin is a blend of 59% Grenache, 32% Syrah, 5% Mourvèdre, 3% Counoise and 1% Vaccarèse. It's full-bodied and velvety, offering hints of vanilla and sandalwood, but there also are layers of dark cherry fruit. Subtle notes of cinnamon, clove and allspice add interest to the long, silky finish. It's an auspicious debut for the Guigal team. Very rich, multilayered Châteauneuf with ripe red-plum and dark-berry aromas. The palate has such intense and fresh, juicy-fruit drive. Long and focused finish. Drink or hold. This is a fleshy and dense offering, with layers of warm cassis, plum sauce and cherry preserve flavors seamlessly entwined, while warm fruitcake and melted red licorice notes fill in through the finish. There's a whiff of smoky tea at the very end, while the fruit plays out. Best from 2020 through 2034. Vinified by the previous team at Nalys and blended by Guigal, this is already showing some detail and interest on the nose, and is considerably more concentrated and rich than Les Stes Pierres but retains a good sense of drinkability. It's full-bodied but well-shaped and structured, with fine tannins and good acidity. There's a mineral edge on the finish and a promising depth of fruit. A blend of 59% Grenache, 32% Syrah, 5% Mourvèdre, 3% Counoise and 1% Vaccarèse, yielding 35 hl/ha.
Drinking Window 2018 - 2026 Marcel Guigal and his son Philippe bought this estate in 2017, adding 148 acres of prime Châteauneuf-du-Pape vineyards to their extensive Rhône Valley holdings. At the time of the sale, the 2016s had already been harvested, but the Guigals finished the blending and aging, holding the wine for 18 months in a combination of barrels (30 percent) and concrete (70 percent) before bottling. It’s an elegant Châteauneuf, sleek in its clean, silky fruit, with a growl of earthy, licorice-tinged tannins that give it length and gravity. "

1816,Castellare I Sodi S. Niccolo,2018,Sangiovese,Italy,99,14,0.0,0,"The 2018 I Sodi di San Niccolò is the most elegant Sodi I have ever tasted, and I have tasted them all. Sodi can be quite the bruiser in its youth, as the tannins are often imposing, but the 2018 is impressive because there is more than enough fruit to balance things out. Dark cherry, plum, lavender, spice and gravel build in a Sodi endowed with mind-blowing purity and exceptional finesse. Superb! A vibrant, balanced and fresh red with raspberries, pomegranates, cherry stones and spice box on the nose. Sleek, tight tannins. Focused, with a very fine structure and wound-up energy. This is marked by new oak initially, then the plum and cherry flavors shine through. Vibrant, with leather and earth elements joining in before the oak spice and tannins frame the finish. Fresh and complex, with a lot going on—just needs time. This celebrated Tuscan red is a blend of mostly Sangioveto (also known as Sangiovese) with a smaller part of Malvasia Nera. The Castellare di Castellina 2018 I Sodi di S. Niccolò shows the elegance and grace of these native grapes with aromas of red and purple fruit, cherry, wild rose and gardening soil. However, there is also a strong oak element that adds spice and toast to the bouquet and textural weight to the wine's generous build. "

Juicy and generous, in spite of just 13% alcohol (moderate in this context), the acidity entirely subliminal, but driving the long, very clean finish. White orchard fruit, Alpine herb and spring blossom aromas waft out of the glass along with a hint of banana.

It sees around 20 months on the lees and around 12% used wood with about 5g/L dosage (lower than previous vintages). It has a shellfish/crustacean tinged bouquet with fine delineation and plenty of energy. The palate is well balanced and has a pretty entry with subtle orange pith and strawberry scents, a fine bead of acidity with ample weight and energy towards the finish.

The grapes were picked at 13.5% alcohol and fermented and matured in concrete with some 10% full clusters to produce a wine that is juicy, varietal and easy to drink. All these wines have a low pH (3.27 in this case) and are fresh and balanced. It's young and primary, with fruit-forward aromas and flavors but with depth and very good balance and freshness.

Medium to full-bodied, the palate is seductively plush and juicy and layered with plenty of freshness, finishing with a spicy kick. 4,788 cases were made. Starting with the 2019 Merlot Napa Valley Reserve, which includes 6% Cabernet Sauvignon, 2% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot, from multiple vineyards, it’s medium to full-bodied, round, and mouth-filling, with a charming, darker fruited, chocolaty style that’s a joy to drink.

It still has the sense of a youthful wine that will develop more complexity and layering with time, and we do see it rewarding a few more years of age, but Chardonnay lovers who are short on patience will find it an immensely tasty effort that requires no further cellaring to please.

It has a deep ruby-purple color and gregarious aromas of blue and black berry preserves, cracked pepper, chargrill and purple flowers. The full-bodied palate has a fine, chalky texture and fresh expression, with detailed aromatic nuances lingering on the finish. The dense purple 2019 Syrah (99% Syrah and 1% Viognier) is a striking, cool-climate Syrah that boasts a gorgeous nose of ripe blackberries, huckleberries, peppery herbs, cedar, and spice. This carries to a medium-bodied Syrah with terrific overall balance, a round, layered texture, and that rare mix of ripe fruit and stunning purity and freshness. It reminds me of a modern Cornas with its incredible purity yet slightly wild, classic Syrah character. The 2019 Syrah Bien Nacido Vineyard confirms my impression that Syrah is the most expressive red wine at the estate. Inky and voluptuous, the 2019 packs a serious punch. A wine of gravitas and character. The 35% whole clusters are pretty much buried by the sheer richness and density of the fruit. The 2019 is a gorgeous wine. Very dark fruit aromas range from roasted to slightly tart on the nose of this bottling, and there are hints of tar and cracked black pepper as well.

In its youth, about three months in bottle when tasted, this is all about the youthful features—exuberant fruit, pungent aromatics, a fair bit of power for this grape and excellent depth.

It was sourced from a single plot in 2008, while this 2016 comes from 10 different plots. The French clones (326 - 327) can be problematic according to winemaker Pierre Seillan: 'With too high yields, too much herbal character is achieved, while with a tight leaf canopy it wouldn't ripen properly'. Cabernet Franc is not new to producing outstanding wines in Tuscany, and Seillant is not new to managing this grape variety in pursuit of excellence. Crimson in colour, it has a super restrained Cab Franc character of cassis and eucalyptus, with an almost citrus flavour in depth and a sweet, toasty finish of milk chocolate, liquorice and cacao powder. This 2016 is sleek and concentrated, with ripe, refined tannins and refreshing acidity. A full and tense wine. A rich, powerful super Tuscan that reminds me of some of the cult wines of Napa.

The savory, full-bodied palate offers fruitcake, cherry marinated in spirits and licorice before firm, close-grained tannins sneak up toward the end and leave a grippy, drying finish.

It's as fine a rendition of this cuvée as I can remember tasting. This is chardonnnay from the chalk soils of Avize, Oger and Cramant. Its flavors provide a contrast of limestone severity and the richness of freshly churned butter, buzzing with apple-blossom scents.

(Tasted: September 17, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon, which comes from Coombsville, is a blend of 91% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. A classic, cool-climate Cabernet Sauvignon with plenty of minerality, spice box, underbrush, forest floor and earth with red and blackcurrants in the background. The wine is medium to full-bodied and tightly knit compared to the other Ariettas and therefore should be cellared for several more years and drunk over the following 15-20.

Juicy, zesty and tight, with a dusty tannins and bright berry fruit on the medium-to full-bodied palate The 2010 Viña Tondonia Reserva has all I expect from a Reserva from Tondonia, complexity, elegance and evolution, a developed nose with notes of forest floor and wild berries, herbs and flowers, a touch of iodine, brick dust and very fine, polished tannins. It has the seriousness and elegance of Tondonia. This elegant red is fine and creamy on the palate, with notes of sun-dried cherry, iron, spiced orange peel, graphite and mocha that slowly unfurl. A bit high-toned on the nose as well as loaded with mineral aromas. Muscular tannins are deftly integrated, while savory dried mint and eucalyptus notes play on the lasting finish.

1907,Inniskillin Gold Vidal Icewine (375ML half-bottle),2019,Other Dessert,Canada,85,9.5,4.1,8,"The 2019 Gold Vidal Icewine was fermented and aged for about 14 weeks in 90% new French oak. It comes in with 272 grams of residual sugar, 10.5 of total acidity and 10% alcohol. Rich and unctuous, this also has classic aromatics and a certain level of freshness that keeps it from being particularly cloying. This is also completely delicious, with a little of bit of spicy apricots on the mouthwatering finish. The acidity lifts the fruit and allows it to shine through. It's never going to be a nervy wine, but it is not flabby either. If you like stickies, this won't disappoint. It should age very well, acquiring a bit more character along the way. Many will like it the way it is, but it can acquire another dimension in time. Best After 2021 "

The ultra-red 2010 Gran Reserva had all the textbook aromas of a long development in barrel and bottle and the polished texture and resolved tannins the category is famous for, with the depth and clout of a great vintage. Exactly what you expect. Assertive dark fruit with ripe plums and mulberries, as well as currants and riper, prune-like notes.

Medium to full-bodied, this velvety-textured beauty delivers peppery spices, hints of clove and cumin and mulberry-like fruit, then ends long, with a touch of licorice. It's a treat to taste a wine with some bottle age that's still readily available. From Giesen's 26-year-old organically farmed hillside vineyard, age has transformed this wine into something very perfumed. With the same polish and flash as the 2016, there's now a touch of volatility acting to lift the blackberry and blueberry fruit, potpourri florals and peppery earthy spice to new heights. The palate still shows lots of tannic grip and the fruit here is holding up well. This still has at least another five to seven years left in it. COMMENTARY: The Giesen family has produced some of New Zealand's top wines. The 2013 Clayvin Syrah is another notch on their belt. TASTING NOTES: This New World Syrah is overtly fruity and rich. Its aromas and flavors of nicely-focused black fruit show up ripe and delicious on the palate. Pair it with roast duck in a white wine reduction sauce. (Tasted: September 18, 2019, San Francisco, CA) Bursting with black cherry, baked tamarillo, vanilla and spice aromas; sweetly fruity and quite substantial on the palate, with firm grip and juicy acidity. Will improve. "

Classic darker currants, tobacco leaf, truffly earth, and spicy oak all define the bouquet, and it’s medium to full-bodied, with ripe tannins, terrific balance, and outstanding length. Based off 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, and the rest Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, and Malbec, buy a case and enjoy bottles over the coming 10-15 years. Best after 2022.

This certainly shows off its sugar in its youth, but it is classically aromatic, fresh and simply delicious. Considering how many round and accessible 2020s I've seen of late, I worried a little as I got to the off-dry categories, fearing that they might be a bit flabby, but if anything, I like this better than the winery's Dry Riesling in this report. It is certainly a nice value in a crowd-pleasing style. We'll see how it ages, but there doesn't appear to be any reason to wait. Best After 2022 "

The wine is dark and satisfying, a black robe of fruit cloaking the gentle tannins. There’s black-currant jam and lingonberry flavor in a completely dry, savory structure, giving the wine an austere impression at first. As it settles in, there’s plenty of room for grilled lamb, or coffee-rubbed barbecue. This ruby-colored wine has a nose of brambly berries, thyme and lavender. Dark chocolate and anise play backup to flavors of black cherry, blackberry and a hint of violet. Fluid tannins are there all along but linger on the palate, with a faint hint of strawberry jam. "

Firm acidity and tannins dominate the palate with elegance and integration; a woven structure which flows with dusty, ripe tannins and lifted freshness. More elegant than powerful, its quintessentially Barbaresco and not without sufficient concentration for ageing. A pretty mineral nose showing blood orange, rust and a racy, dark raspberry and cranberry character. A hint of dry earth and vanilla as well. Very firm and sinewy with a medium-to full-bodied palate, showing impressive purity and fine grip. Very well-made.  The Massolino 2019 Barbaresco offers fine and delicate fiber with plenty of wild berry, blue flower, licorice and crushed stone.

Rich and dense layers of dark fruit with brooding complexity. Coffee, clove, charred rosemary and cassis. Very well balanced. This needs some time to integrate everything that’s going on. Best after 2024. Once this syrah sheds its reductive cloak, it shows off the red-fruit warmth and dusty expressiveness of one of Walla Walla’s most esteemed vineyard sites. It’s surprisingly floral, leading with scents of black tea and lavender, giving way to a compact blackberry core of flavor, limned by tobacco and caramelly oak. The wine’s compactness and concentration suggest a long life in the cellar. The 2019 Syrah Estate Seven Hills Vineyard (100% Syrah) comes from a site in the Walla Walla Valley and is another terrific effort from this team. Blackberries, plums, ripe black cherries, peppery spice, and subtle chocolate notes all define the bouquet, and it's medium to full-bodied, has terrific purity, a balanced mouthfeel, and outstanding length. I'd happily drink bottles any time over the coming decade. L'Ecole always puts forth a fruit-forward, unabashedly delicious offering of this variety, and that is what we have here. The aromas are primary, with notes of blueberry, raspberry and spice. Plump but still deft, center-focused flavors follow. There's plenty of structure behind it. It's impossible not to enjoy it.

It rushes a bead of lime-tinged bubbles across a core of juicy acidity, with a measured inner sweetness that’s nicely contrasted by hints of sour apple. The palate is left completely refreshed, as the 2020 tapers off with subtle nuances of buttery pastry and pretty inner florals. This may lag behind the more exotic 2019, but it’s a perfectly harmonious expression. The Primo Franco is a selection of fruit from Nino Franco’s high-elevation vineyards.

The vineyards are located from 100 to 200 meters above sea level with quartz sandstone soils mixed with white clays, marly limestone, flysch and red sands. Best after 2022. The 2020 Bolgheri Rosso is an absolutely gorgeous wine that overdelivers in its peer group. Silky, layered and light on its feet, the Rosso is superb.

Yet, on the palate it is full and linear with dusty tannins and a fresh finish. White pepper and spice on the finish. Very contrastive and fun to drink From organically grown grapes. Drink now. The 2019 Ternario 1 is pure Garnacha Tintorera from the only trellised vineyard they have, planted ungrafted 25 years ago at 800 meters in altitude. The wine has 12.8% alcohol and good freshness. It fermented with some full clusters and matured in 20,000-liter oak vats and concrete for seven months. This is a little more austere than the Calizo, spicy and less forward, nuanced and with complexity but without the immediate fruit of the Calizo. There is more concentration here and more structure; the tannins are chalky and the texture serious, and the finish is long and dry.

Much more broad, round, and expansive compared to the Red Mountain release, it has supple, velvety tannins, no hard edges, and a great finish. It's not far off the heavenly 2018 and will shine for 30 years as well. Readers will love being able to compare these two great vintages over the coming decades.

Made from 100% Malbec from a number of vineyards (Angélica, La Pirámide, Nicasia and Adrianna) fermented and aged in 70% new barrels, the 2016 Malbec Historic Rows is an incredibly elegant, seamless wine that has an almost Burgundian style in its mulberry, blueberries, incense, forest floor, and spring flower-laced aromas and flavors. Beautiful on the palate as well, with medium to full body, supple tannins, and terrific balance, this is one of those wines that grows on you with time in the glass and shines on all accounts.

Rita Hills Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,60,12.8,0.0,0,"Racines is a collaboration between Tyler Winery’s Justin Willett, Domaine de Montille’s Étienne de Montille and Brian Sieve, and Rodolphe Péters of Champagne Pierre Péters, working with entirely Sta. RIta Hills fruit. For the most part, the entire lineup levels-up the intensity and structure of the Tyler wines, as is the case with their Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir. Sourced from multiple sites across the appellation with a backbone of La Encantada Vineyard. Meaty, dense and reminiscent of a damp forest on the nose and palate, with a balanced, dark-fruited, saline-heavy finish. "

1981,San Filippo Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,79,14,0.0,0,"Sweet berry, cherry and floral aromas with some dried fruit as well. Hint of cedar. Full-bodied and chewy with lots of fruit, tannins and vanilla. Big and rich. But still fresh. Try after 2024. There are plenty of savory elements here, from the juniper and sage to tobacco notes aligned with steeped cherry and strawberry fruit flavors and a hint of rose. Dry, dusty tannins line the finish. Best from 2024   "
1982,Trimbach Gewurztraminer,2017,Gewurztraminer,France,28,14.5,3.8,69,"Attractively fused florals and white peaches with lychees and apricots. The palate has a very fleshy feel with rich and juicy texture and smooth peaches and apples. Lightly sweet, full-ish finish. "
1983,Cuentavinas Alomado Rioja,2019,Tempranillo,Spain,79,14.5,0.0,0,"A very pretty and polished red with cherry, berry, strawberry and citrus aromas and flavors. It’s medium bodied with round, nicely integrated tannins and a flavorful finish. Fresh, yet structured. Whole-berry sensibility to this. Drink or hold. The 2019 Alomado is darker and richer, with chocolaty red and black fruits as well as gorgeous spring flowers, violets, and sappy herb notes developing with time in the glass. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has outstanding purity, silky tannins, and a great finish. It's already drinking nicely today yet should easily evolve for 10-15 years. This cuvée is 80% Tempranillo with the balance a field blend of white varieties. It spent 18 months in used barrels. Best After 2022 The 2019 Alomado was produced with a field blend of Tempranillo with some 20% white grapes—Viura, Malvasía Riojana and Calagraño—from a vineyard in the process of being certified organic; the vineyard was planted in 1960 in Finca Ribarrey, the last valley of San Vicente de la Sonsierra, on silty and clay soils with limestone and 60% boulders. The destemmed grapes were co-fermented in small oak vats, and like with the other wines, the fermentation starts with indigenous yeasts and finishes with selected yeasts. The wine went through malolactic in used 500-liter oak barrels, where it matured for 18 months. It's much fresher than the 2018 I tasted last time and in line with the 2020 I tasted next to it, despite the 14% alcohol. The oak is neatly integrated and the tannins are fine. Best After 2022 "

Rich and effusive in feel, with notable depth, Ivoire et Ebène is so expressive. The weight and richness of the Pinot very much comes through in both the wine's flavor profile and overall feel. Red plum, cinnamon, licorice and chamomile linger on the creamy finish. Hints of honey and juicy apricot and melon fruit are woven with notes of whole grain toast, smoky mineral and preserved lemon in this well-knit, satiny Champagne. Fresh and focused on the lightly spiced finish. Drink now "

Elegant, with good cut to the ripe berry, roasted plum and dark cherry flavors that are matched to plenty of dark chocolate and mocha notes. Ends with herbal accents on the finish.

Best from 2023 through 2027. Made from organically grown Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of iris, Mediterranean brush and redskinned berry.

1992,Sandar & Hem Bruzzone Vineyard Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,California,39,12.7,0.0,0,"From a vineyard located just four miles from the ocean near the famed Mystery Spot, this bottling is superclean and tight on the nose with Asian pear, yuzu-pith, nectarine and wet chalk aromas. The focus is intense on the palate, where a chalky core frames fresh jicama and borderline minty flavors, which fascinate with each sip. "
1993,Numanthia Toro,2016,Tempranillo,Spain,55,15,4.6,10,"A dense, layered red with berry, chocolate and walnut character. It’s full-bodied and very luscious with power and richness, but shows some reserve and lots of polish at the end. This expressive red is marked with layers of cherry coulis, tangerine, toast and anise notes supported by full, refined tannins and details of wild herb, loamy earth and mineral. Powerful and luxurious in feel. "

1995,Penfolds Club Tawny,Port,Port,Australia,14,18,4.0,108,"Very spicy, sporting caramel, cinnamon and tarry flavors, sweet and silky on the long finish. The Penfolds Club Tawny is a delicious fortified wine. The wine shows aromas and flavors reminiscent of Portos from Portugal. One may not even recognize the difference and could be surprised that this wine is a New World effort. The wine's cream, pruney, and rancio character—rancio is a recognized flavor descriptor that is often found in many Sherries—adds additional nuances that make the wine stand out. Drinks well now, and would be perfect with chocolate mousse or mild cigar. (Tasted: October 31, 2016, San Francisco, CA USA) "
1996,Fontanafredda Barolo Vigna La Rosa,2016,Nebbiolo,Italy,129,14.5,4.5,5,"On the savory side, this red opens with freshly mowed grass, hay and eucalyptus aromas before revealing cherry, strawberry, rose and mineral flavors. Fleshy, with a matrix of dense tannins flexing their muscles on the finish. Shows excellent potential. Best from 2023 through 2042. Rose, red-berry, wild herb and baking-spice aromas take center stage on this fragrant, elegant red. Loaded with finesse, the full-bodied palate delivers strawberry compote, star anise and cinnamon alongside a mineral note evoking rusty nail. Taut polished tannins and bright acidity provide the age-worthy framework. Drink 2024–2046. A creamy and juicy red with cedar and meat to the plum and berry undertones. It’s medium-to full-bodied, fruity and flavorful. Hints of fudge and hazelnuts. Very drinkable now, but better after 2022. The Fontanafredda 2016 Barolo Fontanafredda Vigna la Rosa also shows that muddled quality that I found in some of the other wines from this estate. I'm not sure if it is related to an over-cropping issue, but the wine lacks the clarity and focus that you should expect of a vintage of this caliber and importance. You get standard aromas with red and purple fruit, spice and tar. There's more focus in the Vigna la Rosa in terms of mouthfeel, and that helps to stitch the wine together. This wine’s lush red cherry and raspberry flavors are accented by notes of licorice and orange peel. It has good energy, with firm, ferrous tannins that keep the fruit tones in balance through a warm, spicy finish. "

2002,Pedestal Merlot,2018,Merlot,Washington,71,15.2,0.0,0,"An utterly spectacular showing from this exciting vintage. 82% Merlot with the remainder Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, this revels in its Turkish coffee aromas with sandalwood, dark currants, chocolate fudge and blueberry compote rounding out the bouquet. This presents a hedonistic bent with an intense mouthfeel and glorious length. Unabashedly big, the acidity and firm tannins hold this gorgeous core of blue and dark fruits in place. Drinking Window: 2021 - 2040. Long Shadows has crafted a beautiful new Right Bank style 2018 Merlot Pedestal, which is nearly all Merlot (82%) with smaller portions of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. Once on the nose this shows an intoxicating bouquet of black currant jelly, espresso bean and shades of black licorice candy. The mouthfeel captured here is exquisite as the Merlot seamlessly glides across the mid-palate delivering a decadent core of dark fruits, black licorice, black peppercorn and espresso ground tones. Finishing very long, this is already a beautifully evolved wine that will improve with an hour in the decanter. Drinking Window: 2022 - 2040. The 2018 Merlot Pedestal checks in as 82% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 4% Malbec that was raised, I suspect, in plenty of new oak. It's another great vintage from this cuvée, which has the final blend put together by Michel Rolland. Offering a wonderfully pure, perfumed nose of black and blue fruits, chocolate, leafy herbs, and flowers, these all carry over to the palate, where the wine is medium to full-bodied and has a seamless texture and a great finish. I’d be happy to drink a bottle any time over the coming 15 years. "
2003,Achaval-Ferrer Quimera,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,Argentina,39,14,4.2,25,"Blackberries with black truffles and violets on the nose. Full-bodied and very tight with firm, silky tannins that give this wine form and energy. Plenty of compressed and focused fruit at the end. Lots of blue fruit. Drink after 2024. Achaval Ferrer's 2018 Blend Quimera is a blend of 60% Malbec, 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, and 10% Merlot from the Uco Valley and Luján de Cuyo. A complex Bordeaux style blend, each variety makes a contribution resulting in a ripe nose with fruit, herbal and balsamic aromas and a terse feel in the mouth with finely grained, rounded tannins, good grip, freshness and juice. The flavors are intense, but the structure veers on overbearing.  "
2004,Chateau Nenin,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,79,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2019 Château Nenin is truly fantastic, and my money is on it being the finest vintage to date for this estate. Based on 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Franc brought up in just 45% new French oak, it offers a pure, medium-bodied, ethereal style carrying gorgeous red and black fruits, spring flowers, damp earth, and chocolate aromas and flavors. It's not a blockbuster and is all about purity, finesse, and elegance, yet it still brings beautiful richness and length. This gorgeous, seamless 2019 will drink well for 20-25 years. Best After 2022 Perfumed nose of crushed stones, blackberries and violets. Medium-to full-bodied with very fine tannins and fresh, minerally undertones. So long, showing bitter chocolate that turns to hazelnut and cocoa bean. Tight and precise at the end. 70% merlot and 30% cabernet franc. Best after 2025. A Merlot-dominant blend complemented by 30% Cabernet Franc, the 2019 Nenin offers up notes of sweet berries and plums framed by creamy new oak. Medium to full-bodied, supple and fleshy, it’s rich and enveloping, with an ample core of fruit and supple structuring tannins. Four hectares on gravel soils adjacent to Trotanoy lend structure, but the 2019 is so polished out of the gates that it might be easy to miss it. Best After 2025 Delivers warm plum sauce and blackberry reduction flavors that cruise through, with a velvety structure and a finish marked by licorice root and anise accents. A solid, forthright Pomerol. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. "
2005,Innocent Bystander Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,Zealand,16,13.5,4.0,16," Presents peach, melon and pear flavors that are fresh and sleek, with a touch of makrut lime leaf aromatics on the finish.  "

2007,Michel Turgy Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut Reserve,Selection,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,48,12,0.0,0,"The latest release of the NV Brut Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Réserve Sélection exhibits aromas of crisp green apple, dried white flowers, hazelnuts and pastry cream. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, elegantly textural and racy, with chewy extract, tangy acids and a delicate, pinpoint mousse, concluding with a chalky finish. It's a precise, flavorful blanc de blancs that's already showing well. "

2009,Planeta Eruzione 1614 Carricante,2018,Carricante,Italy,43,13,0.0,0,"Slightly evolved and showing a deep sense of complexity and textural richness, the Planeta 2018 Sicilia Carricante Eruzione 1614 is yet another reason to love Etna's terrific Carricante grape. (There's also a 10% touch of Riesling in this edition of 62,000 bottles.) That extra time in bottle, tasted now three years after the harvest, produces dusty mineral definition and ashy volcanic tones. The wine is linear and precise with more austerity that raises the bar in terms of its food-pairing potential. A beautiful seafood platter with grilled prawns might do the trick. Decidedly more savory than sweet and flinty as well, the 2018 Carricante Eruzione 1614 sends up a stunning bouquet of dried apricots, grilled orange and hints of white pepper. Its silky and pliant textures quickly gain a more tactile feel, as a mix of bright acids, saline-minerals, tart orchard fruits and sour citrus cascades across the palate. There are depths unseen here, as the 2018 displays a youthful density while remaining lifted, balanced and simply tempting the imagination as to what’s to come with further cellaring. A beautiful Etna Carricante with a 10% addition of Riesling that shows tremendous tension. Well done. Lemon-rind, pear and green-apple aromas follow through to a full body with a round, creamy palate of ripe and dried fruit that comes across mostly tropical. Creamy texture. Really tangy.  "
2010,Croft Fine,Ruby,Port,Portugal,12,20,4.2,171,"Well-balanced, powerful and fruity, with dark plum, red berry and spiced cherry flavors that feature plenty of smoke and spice. Notes of black licorice mark the finish. A suave ruby. Drink now through 2020. 2,000 cases imported. "

2013,Marciano Estate M Proprietary Red,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,139,0,0.0,0,"I loved the 2018 M Proprietary Red Wine, another gorgeous wine from this tiny estate. Lots of crème de cassis, blueberries, iron, and a kiss of crushed stone-like minerality give way to a deep, full-bodied, concentrated wine with plenty of baby fat mostly concealing sound underlying structure. A blend of equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, it's going to take 7-8 years to shed some fruit but should be long lived. With 35% Cabernet Franc planted on the 10-acre vineyard at Marciano Estate, this M label showcases the extra proportion of this grape. The 2018 M by Marciano is a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 50% Cabernet Franc. Displaying a deep purple-black color, it rockets out of the glass with vibrant notions of blackcurrant pastilles, re currant jelly, kirsch and pencil shavings with hints of dusty soil, bouquet garni and wet pebbles. Full-bodied, rich and seductively fruity in the mouth, it has finely pixelated tannins and a lively backbone, finishing with fantastic length and lots of mineral sparks. Give it another couple of years in bottle to really strut its stuff, and drink it over the next 25 years+. "
2014,Andre Robert Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Extra,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,72,12,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: Champagne André Robert Blanc de Blancs is fresh and crisp on the palate, with an energized aftertaste. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of mineral notes, citrus peel, and green apple. Enjoy it with a lightly-seasoned Ahi tuna poke. (Tasted: September 12, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The NV Extra-Brut Les Jardins du Mesnil is based on the 2016 vintage, complemented by reserve wines from 2015, and it was disgorged in May 2021 with four grams per liter dosage. Revealing notions of crisp green apple, citrus oil, wet stones and fresh bread, it's medium to full-bodied, pillowy and incisive, with a pretty mousse and a bright spine of acidity. "
2015,Louis Latour Beaune Vignes Franches Premier Cru,2017,Pinot Noir,France,84,13.5,3.9,5,"Dark berries, spice and iodine. Hints of dried fruit, too. Full-bodied, round and juicy with lovely fruit and round tannins. Flavorful finish. Delicious and decadent already. Hard not to drink now, but better in 2021. A beam of sappy cherry and kirsch marks this lush, smooth red, with a core of fruit accented by loamy earth and spice notes. Shows a light smoky cast and a long finish. Best from 2021 through 2033. "
2016,Ladeiras do Xil O Diviso,2017,Other Red Blends,Spain,108,0,0.0,0,"The 2017 O Diviso is only the fourth vintage from a vineyard in the zone of As Ermitas. They have been recovering and replanting a 1.2-hectare plot with a field blend of Mencía, Garnacha, Mouratón and some Caíño to complete the 2.9 hectares that have been replanted. This fermented with indigenous yeasts in small oak vats followed by one year in oak foudres. It's only 13% alcohol and has soft acidity. For Pablo Eguzkiza, this wine is always different; it has more tension and is subtler, more serious, very long and with finesse, a more refined version of As Caborcas. This is their highest-altitude vineyard and the one they harvest last. The wine has restraint and complexity, the combination of old vines and a long cycle even in an early year like 2017. Production has been slowly growing, and even though 2017 was a low-yielding year, they managed to produce a record 1,170 bottles. Vivid ruby. Vibrant red and blue fruit, potpourri and incense aromas take on smoky mineral and candied licorice accents with air. Stains the palate with sappy, spice- and mineral-inflected boysenberry, bitter cherry, licorice and candied violet flavors that deliver a compelling blend of depth and vivacity. The floral and mineral notes echo on a strikingly long, detailed finish that's subtly framed by polished, even tannins.  "
2017,Maximin Grunhaus Abtsberg Riesling Superior,2020,Riesling,Germany,67,7.5,0.0,0,"A noble and distinguished dry white that may not be analytically dry, but has the same kind of balance and finesse as a top Loire wine and the same concentration as a Grand Cru white Burgundy. Super mineral and precise finish that makes this unforgettable. Drink or hold. "
2018,Rodney Strong Brothers Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2016,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,90,15.75,4.2,10,"This single vineyard reaches elevations up to 1030 feet. Scents of dried blackberry, black tea, and mocha sandalwood lead to an impossibly satin textured mouthfeel: dense, powerful, but opulent. Licorice and espresso are a fine pair, with cherry pith tannins. Aged for 26 months in French oak, the wine is round, not wound up. COMMENTARY: The 2016 Rodney Strong Vineyards Brothers Cabernet Sauvignon is richly layered and beautifully persistent. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers classic aromas of blackcurrants, anise, and oak. Pair its long and generous ride on the palate with a well-marbled, grilled Porterhouse. (Tasted: December 14, 2020, San Francisco, CA) Black olive, rock and black currant highlight this wine’s deeply concentrated core of grippy tannin's.

The only difference is that this year they used a small amount of very young Garnacha. 2019 was a warmer and drier year than 2018. The fruit ripened earlier and shows explosive. It's a year of generous expression—a positive, happy year. The wine is immediate, approachable and gentle, with very fine tannins. Saturated ruby. A highly perfumed, smoke- and spice-accented bouquet evokes primary cherry and blueberry scents, along with candied licorice and potpourri nuances. Seamless and impressively concentrated, offering appealingly sweet dark berry, cherry cola and floral pastille flavors that meld richness and energy. Dusty tannins build steadily on a long, gently chewy finish that leaves cherry liqueur and lavender notes behind. This glossy red bursts with bright, pure cherry and currant notes lined with floral, licorice and mountain herb details. Accents of tea, spice and mineral slide into the finish. Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. "

2023,Rhys Vineyards Horseshoe Vineyard Syrah,2013,Syrah/Shiraz,California,97,13.5,0.0,0,"Rhys' 2013 Syrah Horseshoe Ranch Vineyard is a downright peppery, gamey, olive and bloody meat-scented Syrah that offers more than a touch of Cornas-like character. Medium to full-bodied, beautifully concentrated and balanced, with ripe tannin and a big finish, give bottles 2-3 years in the cellar and drink over the following decade. One of the highlights in this range, the 2013 Syrah Horseshoe Vineyard is superb. A host of cool-climate Syrah aromatics make a strong first impression. Black pepper, game, smoke, tobacco, licorice, black olives, lavender and spices are all beautifully delineated in the glass. The expression of fruit is pure California in its radiance and overall depth. Complete and impeccably balanced, the 2013 Horseshoe Syrah has it all. "

The fabulous, opaque purple-colored 1999 Cote Rotie, which spent two years in wood (30% new), reveals a glorious bouquet of bacon fat, creme de cassis, licorice, violets, and spice box. It is full-bodied, with sweet tannin, great presence in the mouth, and a knock-out finish. The only problem is that production is small. Ogier's 1999s are magical. Very alluring, with cocoa and mesquite notes leading the way for a super silky palate loaded with mature vanilla, incense, black cherry, sweet tapenade and mineral notes. Has a very long, very fine-grained finish. The first vintage at this domaine to be partially destemmed. "

Their rosé, which gains its delicate salmon color from direct press of the red grapes, rested for three years in bottle on the lees, developing toasty notes that complement the wine’s flavors of tart cherry, cranberry and blood orange. Lingering saline notes point to the wine’s volcanic origin, and it finishes clean and bright, ready for a range of seafood or salty appetizers. The 2019 Brut Rosé Metodo Classico, a varietal Nerello Mascalese vinified white, lifts from the glass with a sweetly scented mix of dried strawberries, roses, hints of cinnamon sugar and smoke. It boasts a silken bead of fine bubbles that massage the palate with notions of ripe pit fruits, hints of white cherry and confectionary spice. This leaves the senses completely refreshed and squeaky clean, with a gentle tug of minerality that seals the deal. The 2019 Brut is stunning and a great entry-level Champagne alternative. "

A fabulous texture follows where layers of dark fruit are pitted against powerful but firm tannins. The 2016 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Don Tommaso is another nice, earthy wine from Principe Corsini, built with elements of black fruit, tar and red brick. A dark and savory quality of fruit dominates the palate, making for a very linear and bright Sangiovese (blended here with 15% Merlot). This is a great interpretation of the vintage. I especially liked the freshness on the close, accentuated by notes of tobacco, tar and licorice that give the wine strong, broad shoulders. It has a textured, dusty feeling on the close. Enjoy those authentic qualities with a simple Tuscan bean and tomato stew with rosemary and plenty of shaved pecorino. Made with 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot—all organically farmed—this has aromas of forest floor, tobacco and cassis. On the linear, rather austere palate, close-grained drying tannins provide firm support for prune, blood orange and star anise.

Very fun and delicious to drink now, but can hold, too. The flinty and faintly reductive 2020 Isidore Vineyard Maule Valley Semillon is part of what they call Fieldcraft Bottlings, ""wines we make when we see an old vineyard that screams of potential but does not 'fit' into the modern wine trade: too small to fill a truck, too far away from a paved road, too narrow to be worked with a tractor. . ."" Mossman explained a bit more, ""As mainstream wants the small modernize ‘like everybody else’: spray instead of cultivate, scale instead of focus, above all reduce the cost of labour—it’s the labor that unlocks the flavor of the wisdom of farming passed down through the ages. We call this wisdom: fieldcraft."" I was blown away by the 2018, the first vintage of this wine, and the 2019 and 2020 are brilliant too and seem to have different personalities.

Drink or hold The 2018 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett offers a deep and flinty, stony and herbal bouquet that needs some time to open up. Remarkably deep and complex, round and textured on the palate, this is a charming, mouth-filling and intense WSU with serious grip and length. Still far from being evolved, this is a richer, more complex Kabinett that will start to impress in 5-10 years. Stimulatingly salty on the finish. Light-footed and lean, this zesty off-dry Riesling is enticingly smoky and earthen on the nose, but the palate reverberates with juicy pineapple, mango and lemon flavors.

Prüm Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett is serious and charming with excellent liveliness on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of apple, dust, earth, and a touch of flowers. Pair it with shredded roast chicken in a toss of arugula, baby spinach, and romaine.

Ethereal in the mouth, the refined bubbles form a healthy mousse while the flavor is anchored in green apple. Toward the end, it’s yeasty with a dry, malic feel. This is a well-made wine. Drinking window: 2021 - 2023 This has aromas of cooked apples, lemon pith, peaches and pie crust. It’s medium-bodied with round bubbles and a ripe, soft palate. Dry. Chardonnay and pinot noir. From organically grown grapes. Vegan. Sustainable. Drink now. "

2109,Hall Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,225,15.2,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon is sublime and memorable. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of red currants, black fruit, and exotic spices. Enjoy it with an oven-baked, well-seasoned Porchetta. (Tasted: June 22, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Rich and fleshy in feel, but with a nice juicy edge for balance, this lets creamed plum and blackberry fruit spill forth, laced liberally with mocha, singed alder, sweet tobacco and melted black licorice. For the hedonist crowd. "
2110,Joseph Drouhin Nuits-Saint-Georges Proces Premier Cru,2018,Pinot Noir,France,129,13,0.0,0,"A dense, fleshy red, whose black cherry and blueberry flavors ride a wave of lively acidity and dusty tannins. Overall, this is balanced and silky, with ample ripe fruit and concentration to match the structure. Mineral and spice accents add detail. Best from 2024 through 2043. The 2018 Nuits Saint-Georges Les Procès 1er Cru has a well-defined bouquet of brambly red berry fruit, woodland scents and light pastille aromas that gain intensity with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with crunchy tannins and fine acidity. A little rough around the edges at the moment, but there is fine backbone and a lovely seam of salinity toward the long and increasingly spicy finish. Very fine. The 2018 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Procès (Domaine) is showing nicely in bottle, mingling aromas of sweet red berries and plums with hints of raw cocoa, smoke and sweet soil tones. Medium to full-bodied, supple and satiny, with a fleshy core of fruit, melting tannins and a long, heady finish, my only criticism focuses on a touch of back-end heat, so this would be best served on the cool side. "
2111,Tenuta Sant'Antonio Campo dei Gigli Amarone della Valpolicella,2016,Other Red Blends,Italy,73,16,0.0,0,"The Tenuta Sant'Antonio 2016 Amarone della Valpolicella Campo dei Gigli (packaged in a very heavy eco-unfriendly glass bottle) is a dark and brooding wine packed tight with richly concentrated black fruit delivered in thick and lasting layers. The bouquet peels back to reveal dark plum and baked blackberry, but there is also a major focus on spice, tar, barbecue smoke and teriyaki. The wine makes a wide and large impact on the palate. It shows enormous textural richness and softly integrated tannins. You can age this blend of 70% Corvina and Corvinone, 20% Rondinella, 5% Croatina and 5% Oseleta (that sees three years in barrel) over the long haul. Very potent aromas of blackcurrants and toasted oak with hints of eucalyptus and black-cherry liqueur, following through to a full palate with firm tannins that drive the fruit on through the long finish. There’s a kind of raw, almost rough-and-ready character to this that’s a bit hard work now. Will even out with bottle age. One for the cellar. Try from 2024. This wine offers a glimpse of dried cherry and plum flavors before the spectrum quickly shifts to notes of smoked bacon, fig and cardamom. The wine aged for three years in new French-oak tonneaux, developing a complex and decadent style that will appeal to the most ardent Amarone fans. "

2113,An Approach to Relaxation Sucette Grenache,2017,Grenache,Australia,58,14.5,0.0,0,"The cool, late-ripening 2017 season played right into the hands of Carla Rzeszewski and Richard Betts, the sommelier power-couple behind An Approach to Relaxation. That was the year they purchased a 12-acre parcel of dry-farmed grenache vines, mostly planted between 1860 and 1880, growing in the deep sands of Vine Vale. The vines had contributed fruit to Sucette’s 2016 vintage, and provided more than half of the 2017 (by 2019, Sucette was entirely from that estate parcel). They make the wine half a mile away, fermenting it with some whole clusters in open-top vats, then aging it in old French oak barrels. Open the bottle and pour a glass: You’ll get a blast of peppery grenache, the bright sunlight stored in the fruit immediately released. It might be worth the price of admission if the wine went south then and there, but that sunny energy and the sand-driven tannins only gain dynamism with air; the delicate strawberry, the darker black raspberry depths, the lavender fragrance and unreal length of flavor make the wine compellingly drinkable for days. A Barossa classic reimagined (think Robert O’Callaghan’s great Dry-Grown Grenache vintages at Rockford Basket Press), this is a wine that has held fast in my memory for weeks after tasting it. The only downside in buying a case is the separation anxiety you are likely to feel on opening the last bottle, and the cravings that may come after finishing it. The medium-ruby 2017 Sucette is another fine example of sand-grown Barossa Valley Grenache. Boasting seductive, rose-like aromas, hints of five-spice powder and a deep base of cherry fruit, it's supremely silky in texture, gently filling the mouth with gossamer goodness, then slowly fading into lingering notes of cracked pepper, star anise and even a bit of ginger. While not overly tannic, it's concentrated and balanced, with the potential to drink well for at least 5-7 years. Shimmering ruby. Vibrant, sharply focused red fruit and floral scents are complicated by peppery spice, botanical herb and smoky mineral notes. Juicy and energetic on the palate, showing strong, spicy lift to its intense raspberry, cherry, lavender pastille and spice cake flavors, which deepen with air. Finishes sweet, seamless and impressively long, with polished tannins adding shape and gentle grip. "

Alex Beloz blends his top cellar selection for his club members, incorporating fruit from all three climate zones of the estate. The wine includes petit verdot and petite sirah (8 percent each) grown at the
highest point in the vineyards, above the fog line at 2,640 feet—a half mile above sea level. The cabernet selections range from vines at 2,300 feet up to the high point, the blend aged in Hungarian oak barrels (75 percent new). This is a beautiful mountain wine from Lake County, its fruit tart without being sour, its red-currant astringency and fresh plum skin tannins providing refinement to the structure. Firm and juicy in its stance, light and airy in its delivery, this is well worth a place in your cellar. Aromas of blackberries, dark cherries, plums, sweet spices and pine cones. Hazelnuts, too. It’s full-bodied with chewy tannins. Fleshy, with a creamy, flavorful finish. Drink from 2023. "
2117,De Martino Vigno Carignan,2019,Carignan,Chile,47,13.5,0.0,0,"The 2019 Vigno had a spectacular and ever-changing nose from the moment I uncorked it. It started with some meaty notes and slowly started developing subtle nuances of roasted coffee, milk with cinnamon and herbs. It has a vibrant palate that makes it feel light and medium-bodied even at 14% alcohol, but the very low pH (3.32) and remarkable acidity (6.38 grams of tartaric acid) clearly lift it up. This is delicious, a wine that never fails to amaze me. It matured in 2,500- and 5,000-liter oak foudres and barriques for 14 months. 11,568 bottles and 60 magnums were filled in February 2020. This is not pure Cariñena, as it comes from a field blend with 10% to 15% other grapes—Malbec, Cinsault, Carmenere and Cabernet Sauvignon—that certainly add to it. The 2019 Carignan Old Vines Series VIGNO is a blend of 85% Carignan with Malbec, Cinsault, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carménère mixed at the Sauzal vineyard in Maule, which boasts old, unirrigated vines, before being aged for six months in barrels and subsequently foudres for another year and a half as per the plan set out by Marcelo Retamal. Bright purple in the glass. The delicate nose is compact initially before opening out into dried flowers and fresh sour cherry and blackberry along with hints of country herb, coffee and vanilla. Intense in the mouth with fine-grained, grippy tannins, plenty of flavor and a juicy flow. "

A rich violet in hue. The subtle, clean and austere nose offers notes of plum and cherry along with violet and herb aromas against a cedar backdrop. In the mouth, the core is provided by a juicy freshness while the texture is chalky. A little reactive grip makes for a compact, nimble and linear flow that guarantees it will grow in the bottle. Fresh grapes appear at the back of the throat enhanced by the tannins. Keep for a while before drinking to allow its subtle character to develop properly.   Loving the depth and the austerity on the nose. This is always very fresh and authentic, showing blueberries, strawberries and violets, together with hints of roasted licorice and white-pepper stemminess. Medium-to-full-bodied with a fine delivery of tannins. Juicy and linear. Agile and drinkable, as always. More academic than hedonistic. "
2120,Mamete Prevostini Corte di Cama Sforzato di Valtellina,2016,Nebbiolo,Italy,65,16,0.0,0,"Rich hints of espresso cream and date accent the creamy layers of plumped cherry, Earl Grey tea and baked strawberry flavors that ripple across the palate of this fresh and elegant, full-bodied red. Firm tannins emerge on the smoke- and spice-laced finish. Drink now through 2029. One of two Sforzato, Mamete Prevostini’s Corte di Cama is a selection from terraced parcels ranging from 350 to 500 metres within the Valtellina Superiore zone. The grapes are dried until the beginning of December. It’s hard to resist its alluring aromas of coffee, prune and cocoa. On the palate, sweet herbs give lift to macerated berries. Though ample and heady, this doesn’t lack firmness or freshness, but the finish is perceptibly warm. "

It has a classic Cabernet bouquet of lead pencil, cedarwood, cassis, and hints of tobacco. More medium-bodied, silky, and elegant on the palate, it has wonderful balance and should evolve gracefully for 15+ years or more. Opening to a nose of complex fruit aromas, dusty florals and subtle oak spices, the 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon Stoneridge Vineyard offers black plum, dark cherry and bitter dark chocolate sensations in the glass. Medium to full-bodied, the wine delivers flavors of dark red fruits and graham cracker elements from the oak, with lively acidity and black raspberry tones that fill the mid-palate. The wine concludes with a delightfully lingering finish, showing a lively balance. A juicy red with plum and chocolate character, as well as walnuts. Medium body, round and easy tannins and a flavorful finish. "
2124,Uccelliera Rapace Toscana,2017,Tuscan Blends,Italy,41,14.5,4.2,11,"A pretty, fruity red, yet there’s tension and firm tannins to the blueberry, orange-peel and walnut character. Medium body and a firm, juicy finish. Drink after 2022. Uccelliera's 2017 Rapace is the most fruit-forward of the three vintages I tasted in this mini vertical (consisting of 2015, 2016 and 2017). This makes perfect sense given the scorching hot and dry conditions of this growing season. Rapace is a blend of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in French oak for 18 months. The wine delivers ripe and dark fruit, with a subtle dusting of crushed mineral that becomes more prominent as the wine takes on air in the glass. However, it is a bit thinner and shorter compared to the other vintages I tasted at the same time. Due to the difficulties of the vintage, production was reduced to 9,600 bottles. Those bottles were filled in July 2019 and were released in January 2020. "

It’s full-bodied and layered with a plush texture and a long, flavorful finish. Warm and rather flamboyant for the vintage. Try in 2025. One of the finest vintages I've tasted from this château, the 2019 Château Siran has a great bouquet of ripe black cherries, blackberries, scorched earth, leather, and cedary herbs. With medium to full-bodied richness, polished tannins, and outstanding overall balance, it's going to benefit from 2-4 years of bottle age and drink nicely over the following 10-15 years. It's an impressive Margaux. Best After 2024 Seductive, showing warmed plum and blackberry compote notes that are lush in feel, with pretty violet and anise hints and a flicker of black tea through the finish.

2166,Graham's 30 Year Old Tawny,Port,Port,Portugal,144,20,4.5,71,"Dried cherries, plums and candied fruit with some figs on the nose. Light toffee, too. Medium-to full-bodied, very sweet and layered with dried fruit, smoked wood, caramel and hints of stems. Some dried earth and salted nuts. Very complex. Drink now. Broad in feel and dark in profile, with walnut and hazelnut notes
leading the way, followed by brown bread, dried fig, bitter orange,
singed almond and juniper notes. A lovely flash of green tea adds
sparkle and detail on the finish, but this stays reliant on its bass
line throughout. Drink now. From Portugal. Builds harmoniously in the glass, with lovely depth and layers, revealing crystallized violets, lavender, cedar, dried pear and fig, plus Madeira honeycake, with creamy praline and Bourbon vanilla to the finish. A nutty spine. Hints of nam pla and walnut extend the reach of its unctuous, honeyed palate. Lingering, caressing finish. The NV 30 Years Tawny Port was bottled in 2013 with a bar-top cork and 125 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is smoother and more harmonious than the Dow this issue, a contrast in house styles. If the Dow's this issue often seemed stern, tight and brooding, this is sexy, sunny and lively, with a burst of sugar on the finish. It starts a little understated and certainly elegant, but it gathers strength and length on the finish. Supple on the first pour, it then adds a touch of brandy, a hit of sugar and a lot of dark chocolate on the finish—just to remind you that this is indeed an old, complex Tawny. The next day, it is beautiful, focused, well balanced and precise. The lifted fruit seems to last indefinitely on the palate. After a week or so, it was darker and more intense. As always, these hold indefinitely in the bottle, barring cork failures, but they are not really meant to be held. COMMENTARY: Graham's is one of most revered names in Porto, and its Tawny Aged 30 Years is magnificent. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits the magic of aged fortified wine. Pair its outstanding aromas of roasted nuts, dried dates, and wood with a perfectly aged Stilton. (Tasted: October 23, 2019, San Francisco, CA) Fully mature, the 30-year blend offers cool spicy satisfaction. Its flavors taste of a range of fruits in marmalade, from candied orange zest to kumquats with their peels. Toasty and bright, apricot-rich, this wine’s bittersweet finish will match a savory almont tart. "

Milk-chocolate, blackcurrant and hazelnut character. So attractive now and delicious. Essentially the second wine of Vine Hill Ranch. The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon is a new wine made by the Phillips family, owners of Vine Hill Ranch, and winemaker Françoise Peschon. It is without question one of the most impressive debuts I tasted this year. Silky and gracious, the 2019 is a wonderfully understated, classy Cabernet that shows the more restrained side of the year in its super-classic mid-weight feel. Cedar, tobacco and sweet floral notes add gorgeous inner perfume. With the Baker & Hamilton Cabernet, the Phillipses aim to make a wine that will work well in restaurants and retail shops, so all of the wine is sold through distribution rather than direct.

The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Vallocchio shows a robust fruit profile and powerful 15% alcohol. The wine reflects the warmth and heat of the vintage, but a deft hand in the cellar assures balance and elegance in winemaking. The bouquet reveals dark cherry, rum cake, balsam herb and tarry smoke. There's no mistaking that hot-vintage signature and the more exuberant and boisterous personality displayed here. The cellar folks should be proud of their efforts in this 5,000-bottle release.

This is a great middle-of-the-road style—not too much, not too little. Bright violet. Expressive black and blue fruit aromas are complemented by floral and cola notes and a hint of cracked pepper.

Silky and balanced, with refined tannins and a long aftertaste. Shows finesse and harmony. Really perfumed with lots of dried fruit and flowers on the nose, as well as crushed concrete. Medium-bodied with firm, creamy tannins that give a dusty and ash-like undertone to the red fruit. Drink after 2023. Aromas of scorched earth, blue flowers, leather and baked plum slowly make their way to the forefront along with a whiff of grilled herbs. Showing the heat of the vintage, the palate offers dried cherry and licorice alongside firm, close-grained tannins that leave an assertive finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind, then drink sooner rather than later to capture the fruit and freshness. The Schiavenza 2017 Barolo del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba shows a delicate fiber and soft renderings of wild berry, rose, tar and rusty soil. The wine is smooth and ultimately especially silky, thanks to the very softened or integrated tannins. This is an accessible and near-term Barolo that falls over the palate in a very delicate manner that is not especially characteristic of Serralunga d'Alba or of this warm and dry vintage. The 2017 Barolo Del Comune Di Serralunga D'Alba is primarily sourced from parcels of Cerrati and Meriame totaling 2.1 hectares of production and was aged for 30 months in Slavonian oak botti. The nose is noted by pure and ripe cherry, leather, and dried violets. Its gamey, iron-like minerality is forward on the palate, with tobacco leaf, and dried raspberry. A solid entry wine from the estate, it is true to the vintage and the region. Drink 2022-2034. "

Very satisfying, long finish with quite some complexity. Drink or hold. A less spicy and more sauvage-inflected nose reflects additional notes of red and black cherry, plum, rose petal and plenty of earth characters.

It’s medium-bodied, silky and loaded with perfumed fruit layers, with a frame of chocolate-textured tannins and juicy acidity begging you to take another sip, finishing very long and very layered. Wild in pomegranate, strawberry and brambly blackberry, this longstanding vineyard-designate is deep and rich, with a density of earthiness. Thick tannins support the fruit and building elements of dried herb and lavender, allowing room for the acidity to balance its overall luxury. "

The 2018 Flor de Muga Blanco was produced with a blend of 40% Viura from red limestone and clay soils, 30% Garnacha Blanca from classical clay and limestone and 30% Maturana Blanca planted on sandy soils. They selected the free run must after a short maceration in the press and fermented it in small oak vats (there's no stainless steel at Muga) at low temperature. The wine was then kept with fine lees in concrete eggs for three months, during which time they expected it to fix aromas and provide some volume, and then it was aged in lightly toasted new French oak barrels for six months. The wine has been kept in bottle for 18 months. A subtle and complex white with sliced-peach, apple and vanilla-pod aromas and flavors. It’s medium-bodied with a solid core of fruit and hints of toasted oak. It’s tight, very subtle and reserved. Blend of macabeo, white maturana and white garnacha. The 2018 Flor de Muga Blanco checks in as equal parts Viura, Malvasía Riojana, and Garnacha Blanca. It reveals a medium gold hue as well as a richer, spicy, subtly oaked bouquet of orchard and citrus fruits, green almond, and chalky minerality. This beauty is medium-bodied, has good mid-palate concentration, bright acidity, and a great finish. I wouldn't be surprised to see it have an interesting evolution over the coming decade or more. An elegant white that layers lightly mouthwatering acidity and a delicate, chalky base note with flavors of yellow pear and plum fruit, salted almond, preserved lemon and a flash of beeswax.

The wine offers a quick note of sweetness with exotic spice mixed in with dark fruit and plum. There is a mild hint of green herb at the end. This is a pretty medium to full-bodied red that offers good freshness and never feels over-extracted. Sweet-spice, chocolate, anise and nutmeg notes to the cassis, blackberries and olives. A medium-to full-bodied, tightly structured red with silky tannins and savory plums in the middle. Better after 2024. Packs a rich, supple profile permeated by black cherry, blackberry, leather, iron and spice flavors. Sinewy in the end, courtesy of the dense tannins, yet food will mitigate the tannic impact in the near term. Merlot, Sangiovese, Cabernet and Syrah. Best from 2024 through 2035. "

Also like the pure Garnacha, this 2018 is rounder and has better quality tannins than the 2019. This is earthy and very much marked by the Cariñena character, with good ripeness and freshness. Malolactic usually takes around seven months, and the élevage is extended over two winters in third use or older, well-seasoned and neutral barrels. This reminds me of an elegant Priorat. The 2018 Cariñena Garnacha Monastrell Bagual Vineyard Lot 96 is a blend of equal parts Garnacha and Cariñena with 10% Monastrell from Caliboro, Maule, that spent two winters in barrel. Vivid violet red in color. The complex nose presents notes of sour cherry, strawberry, liqueur, rum cake and a little stock. Intense in the mouth, where the firm, free-flowing tannins of the Cariñena set the tone while freshness keeps everything light on its feet. An energetic, slightly alcoholic wine made in a new style.

The 2019 Alicante Bouschet was aged for one year in 40% new French oak. It comes in at 15.1% alcohol. Big and dense, this has fairly ripe tannins, notwithstanding some grip on the finish, but also very ripe fruit. The beefy nuances around the edges give this some complexity. In a similar style to the monovarietal Touriga reviewed this report, this seems like the better wine. This Alicante has better structure and more concentration. Of course, it also has all that Alicante personality and it is another $8. So reasonable minds might differ on what choice to make. This should age decently for several years, but the tannins are ripe enough so you can approach this now without a problem. It's worth leaning up for the moment, but this does have to demonstrate it can age a bit to justify my current enthusiasm. "

Its aromas, while less than bold, do speak of depth and focus in a way that suggests early drinking, but, if you have the option, please do join us in laying some of it away for a few years while it gains richness and loses some of its tighter pieces. It is slightly sweet in a firmly balanced way that will allow it to shine as a stand-alone sipper, yet its best uses could well be alongside dishes like grilled day boat scallops or oven-baked cracked Dungeness crab seasoned with orange, ginger and soy.

The NV Brut Rose Premier Cru stands out for its vibrant, direct personality. Deceptively pale in color, the NV Brut Rose Premier Cru presents a tense, vibrant expression of fruit that is highly appealing.

(Tasted: March 22, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The 2019 Pintas Character is a field blend (over 30 grapes, but the majority are Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional) from old vines aged for 18 months in 90% used French oak. As always, the Pintas Character is not quite as powerful or as concentrated as its big brother, Pintas, but this easygoing red has more going on than seems apparent on first pour. Coming back to this after half an hour helped a lot. At that point, it showed off its structure. It features ripe tannins but a firm finish. Then, the fruit also evolved, becoming very expressive. Both approachable and serious, this year's version of Character should age pretty well. It is drinking decently now, but it can still improve over the next few years. It does need to demonstrate it can do that, but it's so appealing today that it's worth leaning up for the moment. Acting as a second wine for the producer’s Pintas, this bottling has a softer aspect at this young stage. It is juicy, with ripe blackberry fruits and good acidity that cuts through the tannins.

It's a treat to taste a wine with some bottle age that's still readily available. From Giesen's 26-year-old organically farmed hillside vineyard, age has transformed this wine into something very perfumed. With the same polish and flash as the 2016, there's now a touch of volatility acting to lift the blackberry and blueberry fruit, potpourri florals and peppery earthy spice to new heights. The palate still shows lots of tannic grip and the fruit here is holding up well. This still has at least another five to seven years left in it. COMMENTARY: The Giesen family has produced some of New Zealand's top wines. The 2013 Clayvin Syrah is another notch on their belt. TASTING NOTES: This New World Syrah is overtly fruity and rich.

There is plenty of dark fruit at its core, but this wine also reveals dry tones of jarred oregano, grilled Mediterranean herb, crushed aspirin and graham cracker. The mouthfeel is pleasantly lean and silky, and perhaps the wine delivers more in terms of length than it does weight or texture. A little more bottle age should help flesh out and soften these results. The 2018 Fontalloro is bright, floral and full of energy. In most vintages, Fontalloro is quite open, but the 2018 is especially nervy and taut. That won't be an issue in time, of course, but readers should plan on being patient. Sangiovese is so expressive here. A whole range of floral and savory accents lingers on the close. Forest floor, toasted oak and camphor aromas mingle with dark spice on this 100% Sangiovese. Enveloping and elegantly structured, the savory palate delivers ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, mocha and licorice framed in fine-grained tannins. Fresh acidity keeps it balanced. Best After 2025 "

Offering up aromas of peach, pear and plum mingled with apple blossom and sweet pastry, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and expressive, with a pillowy mousse and a generous core of fruit, underpinned by bright acids. Always open in the exposition of the origins of its wines, Philipponnat has upped the stakes of late by not only adding foudres to its vinification armoury but also increasing volumes from two separate Réserves Perpétuelles. The result is impressive; Pinot power writ large in red fruit and biscuity complexity, with resonance on the back palate, the ensemble still harnessed by disarmingly energetic freshness.

From a long-standing McLaren Vale wine family, this red blend is rare Down Under in that it's a cofermented field blend of Cabernet and Shiraz. Cabernet's distinctive characters shine on the nose: eucalyptus, olive brine, juicy berry fruit and some pencil lead. But Shiraz's chocolaty richness is there, too.

A 75-25 blend of pinot noir and chardonnay, like almost all of Billiot’s wines, this does not undergo malolactic conversion, creating a powerfully structured, muscular wine. The fine bubbles add to the briskness of its mouthwatering red fruit, its fruit-skin depth making the finish rich. Pour it with hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar).

Lovely. Drink now through 2028. 600 cases made, 75 cases imported. Light chicken-stock aromas on the nose, it's meaty but fresh and fragrant. Light- to medium-bodied, very pure and drinkable. Exceptional finesse, light in tannin, but it has structure. Surprisingly long finish. Not as powerful as most Saint-Josephs, I would drink a glass of this on its own, or with lightly-flavoured dishes. Christine Vernay’s St-Joseph comes from 3.5 acres of organically farmed vines on the steep granite slopes of Chavanay. The 2018 is seductively floral and herbal, with scents of rosewater, mint and pink peppercorns that invigorate the purple-plum fruit, keeping it bright and angular, firm and snappy. The flavors deepen and broaden with air, as they will with cellar time, but you could drink this now, with grilled mackerel or a lean cut of beef. Another outstanding wine, the 2018 Saint Joseph Terres D'Encre has a smoky, mineral-laced style carrying lots of blackberry and mulberry fruits, notes of ground pepper, gunflint, and smoke, medium-bodied richness, and polished tannins.

of salted cherry paste suggests what’s to come. Indeed, with a day of air, pithy grapefruit flavors and cinnamon spice come out to play, sliding
into sea-salt and floral notes in the finish. It certainly shows its complexity, but the intensity of the flavors doesn’t pull it away from restraint. The
tannins seemed to stick to my teeth, making my mouth water for simple, fatty pork carnitas, shredded and recrisped, pulled off the hot iron with
fresh corn tortillas. Very stylish, with underlying richness to the mix of wet hay, white peach, lemon pith and pink grapefruit. Reveals a late twinge of fleur de sel, which keeps everything honest through the lengthy finish. Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah. Drink now. "

Spicy oak, tobacco, dried flowers, and blackcurrant notes all make an appearance in the 2018 Château Fleur La Mothe. This beautiful, seamless 2018 is medium to full-bodied and has a plump, rounded texture, ripe tannins, and a great finish.

Like all of Bradley's wines, it has juicy acidity and terrific purity, is medium-bodied, elegant and lively. It also has a vibrant, poised style that's going to age beautifully. It's one of my favorites in the lineup but needs 3-4 years of bottle age. This saw 88% whole clusters and spent 18 months in 42% new French oak. COMMENTARY: The 2016 Big Basin Coastview Vineyard Pinot Noir is one of the best Monterey efforts I have tasted in a long time. TASTING NOTES: This wine shows power without taking over the palate. Its precise aromas and flavors of bright red fruit should pair beautifully with a grilled Loch Duart Salmon fillet. (Tasted: April 23, 2019, San Francisco, CA) Grown at about 2,200 feet above the Salinas Valley with views of the Monterey Bay, this bottling, which saw 88% whole-cluster fermentation, shows crushed hibiscus, spicy cinnamon, anise and red plum on the pungent nose. Crisp pomegranate and raspberry flavors meet with sumac and aromatic mints on the palate. From a vineyard not far from Pinnacles National Park, this reflects the site’s coolness with its savor.

2630,Site Larner Vineyard Grenache,2017,Grenache,California,54,0,0.0,0,"The 2017 Grenache Larner Vineyard is laced with the essence of sweet red cherry, pomegranate, mint and blood orange, that are all kicked up a few notches by bright acids. The 2017 needs a few years in bottle to be at its best, but it is very clearly a stunning wine just the same. Moving to the reds, the 2017 Grenache Larner Vineyard checks in as a blend of 88% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 2% Viognier sourced all from the Larner Vineyard in Ballard Canyon, and aged 18 months in neutral puncheons. Vivid blackberry fruits, notes of ground pepper, violets, and ground herbs, medium to full body, and remarkable purity of fruit all make for an incredibly compelling Grenache blend. However, it’s firm, focused, and concentrated on the palate, so give it a year or two. The 2017 Grenache Larner Vineyard is a blend of 88% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 2% Viognier and was bottled a couple days before I tasted it. Deep ruby-purple, it's a bit shy at the moment, hinting at dusty earth, aniseed, garrigue and floral tinges over a dense core of black and blue fruit preserves. The palate is full-bodied—a very rich, dense style of Grenache—with rich fruits, firm, chewy tannins and just enough freshness, finishing long and savory. "

It's going to evolve for 15 years or more. Deep ruby purple, the 2018 Syrah Bien Nacido Vineyard features spicy blackberry preserves on the nose with pure accents of bay leaves, tar and garrigue, more savory nuances emerging with time in the glass.

It could find a home with braised game, like boar, and after, with a cheese course Blackberries with some dried fruit and hints of sultanas. Slightly lifted. It’s medium-bodied with lovely sweetness and a lightly chewy and grippy ending that turns sweet and slightly dry at the end. Delicious Port. Solid, with a polished set of violet, plum cake, blackberry reduction and ganache flavors cruising through and an echo of Black Forest cake lingering on the finish.

Drinking Window 2018 - 2023 With a developed nose of forest floor, cigar box, sweet spices and cured meat, the 2009 Gran Reserva is the most classical within the Campillo range. It has plenty of tannins and feels a bit developed, like the fruit is now receding and the tannic structure might remain. I'd drink it sooner rather than later. 30,000 bottles produced.

That chalky tension and flavor run through the palate, giving a steady edge to the lime blossom, lemon balm and underripe pineapple flavors. The 2020 Chardonnay Solomon Hills Estate comes from the colder of Bien Nacido's two estates. It's located eight miles west of Bien Nacido and is the westernmost vineyard in the Santa Maria appellation. Vines are planted in beach sand, and there are no mountains to block sea breezes, so it is an especially cold, windy, foggy site. Matured in 40% new French oak, it opens with some toasty nuances and flinty streaks, with a core of white peach, lemon-lime, saline and acacia.

It is supple at entry and fairly mouthfilling in both flavor and texture, yet, at the same time avoids the coarseness that can attend wines of its size. Its concentration shows more clearly on the palate, and the tannins that do extend into the finish call for nothing more than a bit of cellaring. "
2662,William Fevre Chablis Valmur Domaine Grand Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,189,0,0.0,0,"Unwinding in the glass with aromas of peach, lemon oil, freshly baked bread, oyster shell and struck match, Fèvre's 2020 Chablis Grand Cru Valmur is full-bodied, concentrated and incisive, with a racy, electric profile and a searingly saline, intensely penetrating finish of striking persistence. This is a terrific Valmur that will merit at least a decade's patience to reveal all its considerable potential. Didier Séguier of William Fèvre says there is a distinct line of Marne soil here, as in Butteaux and Vaulorent. Very precise, showing a touch of orange zest on the palate, all kept in check by vibrant acidity and minerality. A rounded, complete Valmur with a long, saline finish. "

Super balance and quality here.  The Damilano 2017 Barolo Liste is a wine of considerable power and depth, although it happily remains firmly within the parameters of elegance and finesse that only a grape as important and versatile as Nebbiolo can manage. I love that duality of brawn and grace that coexist here. The warm 2017 vintage helps to turn up the volume even higher in this expression from Liste. It aged in large oak for 24 months.

The full-bodied palate is powerful and grainy, with bright acidity to balance its concentrated fruits, and it finishes long and spicy. From a high-elevation site and blended with 13% Malbec and 10% Petit

Espresso colored, it exudes dried fig, praline, butterscotch, smoke and mocha aromas. The palate is intensely sweet, with a lick of alcohol heat, but with beautiful freshness to buoy the dried orange, fig and toffee flavors, which linger long on the endless finish. Savor with a caramel-and fruitbased dessert. The olive rim to a walnut-brown heart of the colour sets the scene; the heady essence of raisin bouquet pushes any discussions of the fortifying spirit to the back row; in its place there is an Arabian bazaar of spices, with a nod to Turkish baklava, then a rolling wave of Christmas pudding with a garnish of dark chocolate and caramelised roast nuts. The ultimate magic of the Chambers wines lies in the freshness of the finish. With a medium brown color going slightly green at the edge, NV Rosewood Vineyards Grand Muscat has aromas of macerated sultanas, fig paste, baklava, toasted hazelnuts and coffee grounds plus a little mace. The palate is very sweet and very crisp with an unctuous silkiness that blankets the mouth and lingers a very long time. Toasted hazelnut, salted caramel and dark chocolate–covered coffee bean flavors are bold and intense, set on a smooth and silky frame, but with plenty of freshness to stand up to the sweetness.

Full-bodied with plenty of concentration, but still shows a very sturdy, tannin backbone and punchy acidity, to drive this through to a long finish. Drink in 2021. Val di Suga owns vineyard plots in three different sectors of the Montalcino zone and vinifies the fruit separately to produce three single-site wines. Vigna Spuntali lies southwest of the town, just 25 miles from the Tyrrhenian Sea, where sandy soils and long, sunny days produced a boldly ripe wine saturated with fleshy cherry and plum flavors. The wine aged for two years in 300-liter French oak barrels that enhanced the richness with notes of toasted almond and dark spice. It’s a powerful wine destined for the cellar. Made with easy-ripening fruit from the sunny southwest quadrant of the appellation, the 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Vigna Spuntali is a charming and fruit-forward expression. This wine is softer and more accessible than the other two single-vineyard expressions I tasted from Val di Suga. The fruit is dark and saturated with summer cherry, plum, spice and tobacco.  Underbrush, plum, crushed herb and French oak aromas mingle with a whiff of new leather.

2835,Vasse Felix Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,Australia,44,13,4.3,5,"This classic wine is rich and concentrated yet bright and elegant. Citrus, melon rind, oyster shell, toasted brioche and nutty notes flow into a beautifully constructed palate. There's crackling acidity straight out of the gate and subtle, toasty oak to ground it. Slippery and slinky, with salinity and depth of flavor, this is a finessed, balanced wine. Drink now–2028. Intense nose of flint, grilled peach, dried lemon, mango, hawthorn, toast and smoked almond. Full-bodied, yet tight and refined, with bright acidity. Compact, concentrated and delicious, with a long, lively finish. Drink or hold. Virginia Willcock takes her prime chardonnay parcels on two separate paths: Mostly Gingin clone, two thirds of this wine is whole-cluster pressed and sent to barrels as unclarified juice. The other portion, harvested to handle some skin contact, gets direct-pressed and goes into barrels with most of its solids. Both lots ferment without added yeasts and age in their barrels (39 percent new) for nine months. Combined, they create a long, fresh, coastal chardonnay with depth. The skin phenolics add richness while also tightening the structure: The wine retains youthful lightness and an ethereal energy. "
2836,Casa Emma Chianti Classico Gran Selezione,2015,Sangiovese,Italy,59,13.5,0.0,0,"Good ripeness to this red, which shows fruit cake, cedar, tobacco and dried cherries and plums. Full-bodied and chewy with plenty of wood showing through, but the driven acidity is more than capable of handling it. Layered and long on the finish. Drink from 2022. A dose of new oak and pipe tobacco marks the aroma here, backed by flavors of black cherry, plum and iron. Firm and compact on the finish, with a lingering essence of woodsy, tobacco and spice elements. There's a lot going on here, but this needs time. Best from 2022 through 2040. The 2015 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione offers a streamlined and well-integrated expression of Sangiovese with warm-vintage aromas of tilled earth and savory spice that serve to the give the wine more padding and volume at the back. Light spice flavors do a great job of framing all that dense, black fruit. Try it with some grilled skewers of liver, onion and tomato. This hails from southeast-facing parcels at 450 to 500 metres on schistose soil. Selected bunches are marked during the ripening season and left until the beginning of October to harvest. After a 30-day maceration the wine is transferred to 10hl Austrian barrels. The aromas are still slightly raw, leading with cherry bark, vanilla and balsamic herb. The palate is more fluid and open, demonstrating integrated wood and tannins with some lovely elegance and minerality underneath. "

Jean-Baptiste Geoffroy enriches the wine’s freshness with reserves that he stores in oak foudres. The combination is smooth and sophisticated, with ripe flavors of crisp apples over a supple texture.

Polished and creamy texture. 35% pinot meunier, 30% chardonnay and 35% pinot noir.  Disgorged in November 2019, the new release of Geoffroy's NV Brut Expression delivers an inviting bouquet of pear, yellow apples, fresh pastry and hints of honeycomb, much like its July 2019-disgorged predecessor. Medium to full-bodied, bright and incisive, it's a chiseled, precise wine with a charming core of fruit, bright acids and a pinpoint mousse, concluding with a delicately chalky finish.

Sweet, seamless and expansive on the palate, offering densely packed black raspberry, blueberry, mocha and floral pastille flavors given lift and spine by a core of smoky minerality. Finishes extremely long and smooth, with slow-building tannins and lingering floral pastille and blue fruit preserve notes. Raised for 19 months in new French oak barrels.   A concentrated tempranillo with a ton of fine-grained tannins. This is still a little shy on the smoky and cocoa-powder nose, but is beginning to develop very nicely on the well structured palate. A touch less oak might have given this more. A textbook Tempranillo, the 2015 Pago Negralada has varietal aromas, red fruit, licorice and spices and a classical, velvety and elegant texture with focused and clean flavors, great harmony and a tasty, long finish. This is like an upgraded version of the Selección Especial. It's a good representation of the zone through its gentle tannins that kind of hide the natural power. It very faithfully represents the conditions of the year, the place and the variety. A true, honest Tempranillo. Bravo! This red is rich yet focused.

There is a lot of extra ripeness that is delivered amply across the wine's dark fruit flavors and its soft textural richness. Nero d'Avola is planted across three hectares in reddish sandy soils. Like other wines from this vintage, it delivers a front-loaded effect.

2901,Cockburn's Vintage Port,2017,Port,Portugal,95,20,5.0,7,"Insane aromas of crushed berry, flowers and lifted ester like a fermenting lager. Full body, tannic yet so finely grained in texture. Extremely long and beautiful. It goes on for minutes. The 2017 Vintage Port is a blend of 52% Touriga Nacional, 30% Touriga Franca and small portions of Sousão and Alicante Bouschet bottled about a month before this tasting after 18 months in seasoned vats. However, I actually tasted a pre-bottling sample because there was some fear of bottling shock. This is sourced from south-facing vineyards in Douro Superior that have a higher proportion of Touriga Nacional. It comes in with 107 grams of residual sugar.

The terroir and the vintage combine to make this a wine that seems at the moment a bit bigger than Dow's this year. Unlike in 2015, however, it also maintains its balance well. This has velvet for texture, fine aromatics and a long finish, but it is always elegant, never jammy. It is still concentrated, and aeration proves how well it can evolve. It finishes with some pop and power, but it will be approachable relatively young. Relatively is the key word there, as it shows plenty of power. Like the Warre's, a Symington sibling this issue, it seems to be a cut above this year, the best in the brand for a while, and superior to both the 2016 and 2015. It is able to hold up to some of its more famous siblings in the Symington stable this issue. Packed with creamed blueberry, açaí berry and boysenberry fruit and carried by waves of velvety structure and warm fruitcake notes, this is showy in style, featuring an embedded graphite spine, alluring spice details and a flash of floral nuance through the finish, imparting superior range and length. Best from 2032 through 2050. Cockburn’s had made a major investment in new plantings of touriga nacional during the 1980s, an asset that modernized and enriched what had been a traditional British style. Perhaps the 2017 vintage, which Charles Symington reports as particularly noteworthy for touriga franca, helped guide Cockburn’s back toward its classical elegance. This is tight and firm, with a cool feel in spite of its peppery intensity of alcohol. As the wine develops with air, there’s a moment when the wine achieves an impeccable balance—a taste of chocolate in heaven—before the tannins begin to show the green edges of youth. Consider this in 20 years. "

Aged 16 months in 21% new French oak, this brilliant Pinot Noir is up with the crème de la crème in the vintage. Scents of sea wrack and black raspberry lead in this plush pinot, from an older vineyard on Cambria’s benchland property that it shares with area wineries. It’s all plums, fleshy and a touch blunt but with a direct, crowd-pleasing lusciousness. Decant a bottle for duck. "

It comes from a vineyard planted with a massal selection of the grapes that they bought. In 2016, they did a selection of two kinds of soils (in this case, the shallower soils because of the cooler and wetter year), then this was fermented in concrete and matured in oak barrels. These Cab grapes were picked in between picking Malbec grapes, which is not like it was done in the past, when Cab grapes were kept for last, and if you left them too late, they dried out and became very tannic. I think this wine transcends the varietal; yes, there are some spicy and peppery notes and it's balsamic, but it's mostly stony/chalky. It has fine-grained, chalky tannins, typical of the variety and the Altamira soils. This is serious, balanced and has good aging potential in one of the finest (if not the finest) vintages. This is a pure cabernet sauvignon with green olives, hints of tobacco and currants. Green cedar, too. Medium to full body, round and chewy tannins and a flavorful finish. "

The 2018 Rodney's Vineyard Revelation is 54% Grenache and 46% Syrah, all destemmed, and aged 20 months in 43% new French oak.

It is beautifully focused. If there's a quibble, it is not the most expressive vision of Assyrtiko from Santorini. It could be a bit riper and show a little more fruit. It is similar in style to the 2019, so at least it has the courage of its convictions.  "

Deep ruby/purple-hued, it has rock star purity in its cassis and ripe blackberry fruits as well as spicy oak, roasted meats, toasted spice, and chocolate aromas and flavors. A more elegant, polished wine than usual, it already has some up-front appeal. It's going to integrate its oak élevage with 2-4 years of bottle age and should have 10-15 years of prime drinking thereafter. The purity and texture here are spot on. Dark and winey, with delicious waves of cassis, raspberry paste and plum puree coursing through, laced with licorice and tar notes that help extend the finish. Late flashes of singed anise, bitters and wood spice add an alluring echo. Best from 2023. A 60-40 blend of Grenache and Mourvèdre aged in a combination of demi-muids and new barriques, the 2019 Chateauneuf du Pape Renaissance shows plenty of smoky, toasty nuances laid over the top of roasted cherries.

3010,Voliero Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,79,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is cool-toned and remarkably pretty, scents of fresh wild herbs and peppery florals giving way to crushed woodland berries and a contrasting flourish of blood orange. Its textures are like pure silk, energized by zesty acidity and becoming quite spicy over time, as tart cherry-berry flavors and saline-minerals saturate deeply. Grippy tannins come forward through the licorice-tinged finale as this tapers off slightly structured, almost salty and remarkably fresh. The 2017 possesses all of the traits of a classic Voliero Brunello, and it’s only in the slightly gruff tannins that you find any mark of the warm, dry vintage. This is exceptional. Aromas of ripe cherries, dried flowers and orange peel follow through to a full body with round, velvety tannins and a flavorful finish. Juicy, plush and fruity at the end. Drink or hold. The Voliero 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is a robust expression with dark fruit, earth and oak spice. The wine shows thick concentration with black cherry and plum. It has the proverbial shoulders (the tannins and the acidity) to support it all. Leather and tobacco play supporting roles, and the wine is also characterized by dry clay and crushed stone. Some 7,600 bottles (and 133 magnums) were filled, and you can drink this bottle straight out of the gate. "

There is a resonance and depth to this release that I really like. Wonderfully pure and concentrated blackberry and plum fruits, layered with spice, dark chocolate, earth, cedar and oak nuance. Succulent and sinewy in the mouth, it flexes considerable muscle, yet remains purely fruited and approachable even at this stage of its evolution. Rich and balanced with fine, ripe tannin and plenty of energy for such depth of fruit. Lovely. Ideal vintage conditions set the stage for this impressive blend – worth waiting for after no Signature was released in 2017. Polished and showy from the off, it exudes concentrated, ripe red plum and boysenberry aromas, with a whiff of vanilla and cedar. There's a caramel oak sweetness on the palate, like a plush velvet-textured cloak over dense, herbal bramble fruit, supported by fine chocolatey tannins and balancing acidity. Vibrant yet forceful. Impressive for its polish and elegant, seamless frame, with cedar, tobacco and spice notes adding warmth to the core of plum and cassis. Offers details of fig, fresh mint and pepper on the finish.

Aged in 60% new French oak, it is polished and intense, with bramble fruit, earthy balsamic tones, a milk chocolate aroma and a slightly herbal touch. Its tight-knit structure, combining crisp acidity and firm yet velvety tannins, makes this a powerful yet graceful wine. Even if you're not a fan of Tuscan Merlot, the tense character it gives to wines in the Chianti region is to be admired. Linear, fresh red with plum and orange-peel aromas and flavors.

The fruity finish is loaded with Asian spice and dark chocolate notes The voluptuous richness implied in the scent is there in the flavor of this Tawny, as it turns up the volume on notes of peach pit, pine nuts and cream. Layered, complex and satisfying, this ends on toasty warmth and supple generosity. Rich, warm caramel and dried plum aromas lead to a soft mouthful of red fruits with striking peppery notes, nuttiness and coffee. The NV Quinta da Ervamoira Tawny RP 10 Year Old Port comes in at 106 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is the new 2015 bottling. Beautifully focused and balanced, this has fine mid-palate weight for the category and a complex medley of concentrated flavors on the finish. Quite gripping, it is beautifully done and rather impressive, while always remaining graceful and impeccably balanced. There is very respectable tension on the finish, too, that enlivens the wine. Taste this in isolation and you'll think my score is pretty stingy, but remember that there does need to be some headroom when we step up to the long-aged Tawny treasures. This may have been my favorite 10 Year Tawny this issue. From the farthest reaches of the upper Douro, Quinta da Ervamoira has produced this sun-drenched wine, with great raisin flavors that vie with a fruity red-berry character. Both sweet from the dried fruits and dry from the intense acidity, with a light cocoa aftertaste, it is a balanced wine that can be drunk now. A fiery wood-style port, the Ramos Pinto 10 year Tawny shows a nice juxtaposition of red fruit and creamy wood. The wine's medium to full bodied palate and lively aftertaste make an excellent choice with a milk chocolate mousse topped with fresh whipped cream. (Tasted: October 27, 2016, San Francisco, CA) "

It aged for 18 months on its lees and developed slight hints of flor, as if it were a bubbly interpretation of a Fino. It moves through the mouth in cool waves of flavor, the texture firm yet creamy. It’s a rich, layered sparkler to serve with suquet de peix, a classic Catalàn fish soup with clams. A wonderful peachy bouquet that blossoms in the glass with hints of dried apricot and honeysuckle.

Superb overall length and finish. Aromas of blackcurrants, fresh herbs and sweet tobacco follow through to a medium to full body and firm, chewy tannins that are fine-textured, yet very evident, suggesting two to four years of bottle age will soften the wine. One of the best Mas La Planas in a while. Try after 2023. Harmonious and tightly meshed, this medium- to full-bodied red has a pure note of black currant chiming through, with expressive coffee, black plum reduction, bay leaf and pomegranate accents.

Aromas of wild strawberries, raspberries and rose petals, as well as sous-bois notes of damp leaves and mushrooms. Medium-bodied with firm tannins and a long, focused finish. Showing some structure for 2018. Needs plenty of time. Best from 2025. The Paolo Conterno 2018 Barolo Ginestra is a little muddled in appearance with a hint of grayish garnet. The wine's color may not be totally luminous, but the bouquet is quite articulate with wild berry, aniseed, licorice and blood orange. There is a pronounced layered of oak spice at the back (following extended aging in traditional botti) that will need more time to integrate. The wine ends with a combination of sour cherry, dusty limestone earth and 15% alcohol. "

3070,Perrier-Jouet Blanc de Blancs,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,99,12,0.0,0,"The latest release of Perrier-Joët's NV Brut Blanc de Blancs is charming and expressive, bursting from the glass with aromas of crisp yellow orchard fruit, pear, white flowers and subtle hints of buttered toast. Medium to full-bodied, elegant and fine-boned, its pretty core of fruit is girdled by succulent acids, concluding with a delicately chalky finish. Lightly toasty and fresh, with a pretty display of poached apricot, blood orange sorbet, brioche and candied ginger set on a lacy, persistent mousse. Shows smoke and spices on the finish. Drink now. A shroud of delight aromas with baked apple, asparagus and a fresh airy lemon-oil notes. Palate with lovely toasty character. Known for its Chardonnay-based Champagnes, this house's Blanc de Blancs—pure Chardonnay—is tautly mineral. It keeps some of the higher dosage of the house, while also having a fine texture, bright acidity and a concentrated aftertaste.  Sleek and saline Blanc de Blancs with aromas of lemon curd, oyster shells, salted butter and apricots. Honeyed and creamy on the palate with soft bubbles. Delicate and silky. Drink now. "
3071,Drappier Grande Sendree Brut,2010,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,119,12,0.0,0,"A quietly elegant Champagne, with a lovely soft, laciness to texture, and a minerally underpinning of smoke and saline accents. It displays a creamy mesh of crushed black cherry, grilled nut, kumquat and dried apricot and a refine, subtle finish. Drink now through 2030. Aromas of ginger, dried pineapple, baked apple, nutmeg and toast. Rich and flavorful, with silky bubbles and zippy acidity. Spicy and gently toasty, with a lengthy finish. 55% pinot noir and 45% chardonnay. Drink or hold. Composed of 55% Pinot Noir and the remainder Chardonnay, about a third of the 2010 Champagne Grande Sendrée was raised in oak barrels. It is fleshy with aromas of buttered brioche, espresso, and apricot, while the palate offers more energy to balance the richness of the wine, with fresh red berries, beeswax, chamomile, and fresh orange, a lovely chalky texture, and a fluffy mousse. Providing a nice balance between opulence and a lifted feel, it is drinking well now. Best after 2022. "

3076,Champagne Henri Giraud Dame Jane Rose,Brut,Sparkling Rosé,France,110,12,0.0,0,"Beginning with the striking, pale copper color, this is very unconventional rosé champagne. Wonderful fruit aromas that range from cherry and wild strawberry to persimmon and candied orange with a touch of sushi ginger. Then comes the mouth-filling and well-structured palate that has an amazing grainy-chalky feel to it, unlike anything else in this category. Very long, saline finish. A cuvée of pinot noir with a small amount of chardonnay that was vinified in amphoras. From organically grown grapes. Drink or hold. The NV Rosé Rose Dame-Jane is light and airy in the glass. Crushed flowers, sweet crushed berries, white pepper and mint are all beautifully lifted. Translucent and gracious, the Dame-Jane is quite a departure for a house that was previously known for rich, opulent Champagnes. The Dame-Jane is done with an 'Oeil de Perdrix' base in which Pinot is given a short time on the skins for added color and structure. Right before bottling, touches of Chardonnay and still Pinot are added to fine-tune the blend. The Dame-Jane is aged entirely in sandstone terracotta, an approach that works beautifully. This release is based on 2017, with 40% reserve wines. There's a plush creaminess to this rich and balanced rosé, as well as a pleasing juiciness that enlivens the flavors of plumped cherry, grilled nut and tangerine peel, with a tangy hint of fleur de sel. Lingers on the well-cut finish.  The latest release of Giraud's NV Brut Rosé Dame-Jane is showing very well, unfurling from the glass with complex aromas of red plums, cinnamon, orange zest, warm bran and smoke. On the palate, it's full-bodied, broad and textural, with all the house's signature vinosity, displaying superb depth at the core, ripe but racy acids and beautiful balance despite its muscular, textural style, concluding with a sapid finish. This is another success. "
3077,Lecheneaut Gevrey-Chambertin,2016,Pinot Noir,France,110,13.5,0.0,0,"A bright, cherry- and black currant–infused red, bursting with juicy fruit, iron and sweet spice flavors.

3080,Hyde Estate Winery Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,79,14.8,0.0,0,"Medium ruby-purple in color, the 2018 Pinot Noir Larry Hyde comes bounding out of the glass with exuberant notes of Morello cherries, pomegranate and raspberry coulis, plus hints of roses, tilled soil and wild sage. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is laden with intense red berry layers, framed by firm, fine-grained tannins and bold freshness, finishing long and perfumed. If we were asked to name the vineyards that lead the way in growing great wines in California, Mr. Hyde's place in Carneros would be among the leaders of that list. This winsome edition shows off the vineyard's way with Pinot, and what a fine wine it is. From its outgoing, yet still youthfully vibrant, fruit-driven aromas of ripe, slightly tart red cherries to its silky feel on the palate, it hits all the right notes. It is admittedly a little rough on the finish at present, but it has so much aging potential that we have no second thoughts about consigning it to a special nook well back in the cellar and letting it evolve for a minimum of another five years. "
3081,Chateau de Saint Cosme Cotes du Rhone Blanc le Poste,2020,Rhone White Blends,France,79,13,0.0,0,"On another level, the 2020 Côtes Du Rhône Le Poste Blanc comes from a gorgeous vineyard in Gigondas (Gigondas doesn’t allow whites, hence the Côtes Du Rhône label) just up the hill from the estate. It has lots of pineapple, bright, sappy herb, and some chalky mineral-notes as well as a medium-bodied, pure, seamless style on the palate. It’s a brilliant white and shows how shortsighted it is for this appellation to not allow whites. I like this today, yet it will be better with a year of bottle age and have a decade of longevity. "
3082,Penfolds St. Henri Shiraz,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,150,0,0.0,0,"A great St. Henri and, although multi-regional, this is very much a wine that speaks of the Barossa Valley, with aromas of ripe blackberries and red plums that are so fresh, together with tobacco, young-leather, earth, chocolate, coal-smoke and tarry accents. Effortless depth on the palate with summer berries, framed in fine, alabaster-like tannins that are underscored with discreet power. So long and captivating. A blend of Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Port Lincoln, Robe, Padthaway, Clare Valley and Adelaide Hills. Drink over the next decade or more. Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Port Lincoln, Robe, Padthaway, Clare Valley and Adelaide Hills fruit. Matured 12 months in 50+yo vats. The effortless, unassuming self-assuredness of St Henri holds a unique and beloved place in the assemblage of Penfolds heroes, and 2018 marks a particularly special release. Accomplished, spicy, glossy black fruits of grand integrity unfold to magnificent effect in the glass, contrasting a fine-boned frame of rigid yet graceful, powder-fine tannins that carry a finish of long-lingering line and alluring appeal. I look forward to spectating from the sidelines as its fruit slowly unfurls over the decades to come. An adorable St Henri that exemplifies all that this label stands for. The 2018 St Henri Shiraz is a terrific effort, perhaps rivaling the top-flight wines under this label in 1976 and 1986. Remarkably fine and silky in texture yet simultaneously dense and concentrated, it showcases the amazing fruit harvested in 2018. Boysenberry, mulberry and mocha shadings all swirl together effortlessly in a whorl of full-bodied elegance, finishing long and effortless. Mainly Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale, it includes smaller amounts of fruit from Port Lincoln, Robe, Padthaway, Clare Valley and the Adelaide Hills, all aged 12 months in large old wooden vats. Juicy blueberry and huckleberry fruit flavors at the core are accented by black and red licorice details, with dense, grippy tannins and notes of black pepper and Earl Grey tea. Impressive for its concentration and focus, along with its muscular structure. Drink now. Post WWII, as winemaking moved into the modern era, there was a decade’s long shift toward stainless steel and new oak barrels. At Penfolds, that shift began with Max Schubert’s development of Grange, finishing top selections of shiraz in new French oak barrels. But the company never abandoned its old oak vats, sustaining an alternate top selection of shiraz as St. Henri, which never sees a barrel. This 2018 takes St. Henri’s savory style toward richness, lasting on sweet blueberry fragrance and gentle, meaty tannins. The wine needs a day or two to open; better to wait on it in the cellar for a decade or more, when it will deliver its riches and restraint with complexity. "
3083,Teso la Monja Victorino,2019,Tempranillo,Spain,79,0,0.0,0,"Jumping up in price, the 2019 Victorino offers more finesse and elegance, with medium to full-bodied aromas and flavors of cassis, black raspberries, spicy oak, and chocolate. It's rich and concentrated, with ripe, velvety tannins and a great finish. It's another pleasure-bent, impeccably made wine in the lineup that I'd certainly be thrilled to drink. The 2019 Victorino was selected from 45- to 100-year-old vines in La Jara and El Palo (Toro), El Rosal and El Risco in Villabuena del Puente and in Valdefinjas (35 hectares) that yielded 21 hectoliters per hectare, quite low. It had a traditional vinification of destemmed grapes with yeasts selected from their own vineyards with malolactic and 20 months of aging in 100% new French oak barrels. This is still very young and marked by the toast from the barrels, smoky and spicy and with ripe and juicy fruit, creamy, very round and with silky tannins, the signature of the vintage. It's tasty and has a clean and defined finish. Very 2019. Gorgeous blackberries and blueberries with some violets. Medium to full body with firm, silky tannins and a long, polished finish. Focused and refined. Extremely silky for Toro. Drink or hold. Offers licorice, cigar box and tar accents on the nose that lead to flavors of black raspberry and boysenberry coulis on the palate. Fine tannins provide grip and tension, firming the finish. "

3085,Llopart Original 1887 Gran Reserva Brut,2010,Vintage Sparkling Wine,Spain,89,11.8,0.0,0,"Now with the Cava de Paraje seal, the 2010 Original 1887 Gran Reserva Brut Nature celebrates the original coupage of the first Llopart wine produced in 1887. A blend of 50% of the Parellada strain known locally as Montonega with 25% each Xarello and Macabeo, it matured in bottle in contact with the lees for at least 80 months. I found very good complexity and balance between younger characteristics and more developed aromas and flavors, with very good freshness and overall harmony. It has some yeasty and balsamic notes, hints of camphor and still a touch of waxy apples. I like the dry finish and the focus the absence of sugar seems to provide. I find this perfect for current drinking. The Llopart family blend this wine from the fruit of the oldest vines in Les Flandes, a north-facing amphitheater at an elevation of 1,250 feet. Half of the wine is montònega,a pink-skinned phenotype of parellada, from vines planted in 1935; the balance is equal parts xarel-lo (planted in 1934) and macabeo (planted in 1956). That fruit comes together in a smooth, succulent sparkler, integrating honeysuckle, nectarine, foresty Mediterranean spice and an edge of minerality. It’s a complex wine, made for shellfish, whether freshly shucked clams or grilled oysters. "
3086,Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,49,15.5,4.3,19,"The base 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley is certainly impressive, and since there are roughly 90,000 cases, it’s an incredible achievement. Classic darker currants, tobacco leaf, truffly earth, and spicy oak all define the bouquet, and it’s medium to full-bodied, with ripe tannins, terrific balance, and outstanding length. Based off 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, and the rest Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, and Malbec, buy a case and enjoy bottles over the coming 10-15 years. Best after 2022. Lovely cabernet notes of bell pepper, blackcurrants, blackberry leaves and cassis, together with some cocoa powder. I like the freshness. Medium body and creamy, powdery tannins. Juicy and extremely drinkable. 80% cabernet sauvignon, the rest merlot, cabernet franc, petit verdot and some malbec. Drink from 2023. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is generous and stylish with a pleasing finish on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits aromas and flavors of ripe berries and an accent of oak. Enjoy it with grilled lamb chops.

The wine opens to pretty aromas of wild cherry, rose, blood orange and iron ore. Winemaking starts with stainless steel and concludes with 10 months in French oak. The vines are planted in clay soils, and when you study the bouquet in depth, you do perceive a tad more structure and concentration as a result. "
3091,Domaine La Barroche Chateauneuf-du-Pape Julien Barrot,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,64,14.5,0.0,0,"I was able to taste two releases from Julien Barrot. Looking first at his 2020 Châteauneuf Du Pape Cuvée Julien Barrot, which is a blend of 60% Grenache, 19% Mourvedre, 13% Syrah, and a handful of other varieties, it sports a deeper purple hue to go with a fabulous bouquet of kirsch and blackberry fruits as well as licorice, crushed stone, licorice, and ground pepper. It shines for its balance and elegance on the palate, but still brings substantial fruit as well as structure. A tasting of two foudres and a cement tank that make the body of the blend point to a precise and fine style of this cuvée in 2020. A little lighter than usual, but enjoyably fresh and slender, with relatively modest levels of alcohol. The Mourvèdre was particularly good here in 2020. "

Deep and phenolic, with tremendous intensity, the 2020 is impressive right out of the gate. The purity of the fruit is just striking. Tangerine oil, honey, chamomile, mint and dried flowers lend resonance throughout, making for a totally unique Chardonnay. I can't help notice that the S&B Chardonnay is more interesting than the Pinot. Crisp aromas of chalk, jicama and white flower make for an extremely stony introduction to this bottling from the region's most historic vineyard. The palate is tightly woven, with bright flavors of citrus juice, lemon pith and chalk combining for a grippy sip. "

3099,Gonzalez Byass Del Duque Amontillado Sherry (375ml,half-bottle),Sherry,Spain,49,21.5,0.0,0,"Maple syrup, wood polish, butterscotch and toffee nose. Great finesse on the palate with a silky texture and salty caramel flavours. Long, fresh finish. Stylish, with warm date, hazelnut, toasted almond and salted caramel notes that extend through the finish, starting dry but ending with a tantalizing echo of sweetness. Toffee and almond aromas are a touch aggressive and hot. Matching the nose, this is intense but still well balanced by core acidity. A giant heaping of rancio blends with flavors of almond skins, apricot and salt in front of a never-ending finish. This muy viejo Amontillado has spent about 30 years in the solera. That age makes for concentrated wine, saline and still fierce in its acidity. Its feels austere at first, the flavors somewhat shy, overshadowed by the wine’s structure, which seems to present a thick wall of limestone. Give it time in the glass and, slowly, it begins to show more detail. It’s even better if you have mojama (salt-cured tuna) to accompany the wait. "

3106,Quinta da Muradella Alanda Blanco,2017,Other White Blends,Spain,44,13,4.3,19,"The 2017 Alanda Blanco is a white blend from a very challenging year when most of the crop was lost to frost. It was kept in tank for 12 months. This is the only white he produced in 2017, using grapes from all the vineyards, whatever he could save, mostly from younger vines and even some second flowering grapes. It has some herbal aromas, bay leaf and fennel, and is still a little closed, as it was only bottled a couple of months ago and should take a few months to settle in the bottle. This is quite remarkable for what it is; it keeps the profile of the whites from the house and is quite fresh for such a weird vintage, with more dry extract from tiny yields and small grapes. It does have flavors, so some grapes managed to ripen. A great effort for the year. "

Medium-bodied and silky, it's elegant with pure fruits, grainy, ripe tannins and great freshness, finishing with meaty nuances. Thyme, black pepper and asphalt give depth to the roasted black-plum aromas on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newer properties. It's fresh and easy on the palate, where black-plum and purple-flower flavors make for a familiar sip. The 2017 Syrah Spear Estate was brought up with 20% stems and neutral oak. It has an exotic bouquet of blackberries, candied violets, incense, and exotic pepper. This carries to a medium to full-bodied Syrah that has a layered texture, fine tannins, notable balance, and a great finish.

They are a lot fresher, similar to the Chacayes, but with the added texture of the limestone soils. As with most of the wines from Altamira, the strength is on the palate, where the wine is compact and serious, with no fissures, with verticality and chalky tannins. This should age magnificently in bottle. A malbec with a focused and very tight tannin structure. Full body, lots of black fruits and minerals. Compacted and refined.

This wine outpaced my initial expectations following my first tasting of this vintage from barrel. The tannins are integrated and there is a sweet, fruity note on the full-bodied close. This has an aromatic array of ripe red and black cherries, blackcurrants, blueberries, cloves, cedar, fresh herbs and licorice.

Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Cão, Sousão and Tinta Roriz. The peppercorn spice driving this wine’s youthful exuberance led one taster to compare it to a syrah from Hermitage. Others described the flavor as akin to tart wild grapes, huckleberries, black currants… The wine is, in fact, packed with fruit, held tight by that peppercorn-like reduction, bursting out of its velvet seams.

It’s still tight and holding things relatively close to its vest, yet it’s balanced, has good concentration, its acidity is nicely integrated, and again, its purity of fruit is something to behold.

This is a fine overachiever that makes me want to lean up on it for the moment. In fact, it has a pretty good track record of holding well.

On the savory palate, notes of licorice, blood orange and coffee bean accent a core of morello cherry. Taut, fine-grained tannins provide support. The Franco Pacenti 2016 Brunello di Montalcino opens to tart cherry and cassis with more layers of spice, licorice and balsam herb at the back. The wine unfolds to show a classic interpretation of the vintage with a mid-weight mouthfeel and bright acidity on the close.

This starts out with perfect focus, elegant but increasingly intense on the tight finish. Early on, it was all about the structure, with a haze of velvet. The flavors were a bit muted initially, but it unfolded into an elegant and graceful whole with a flavorful finish. Its bright, clean feel always remains as it fleshes out and puts on weight. "

I like its purity of fruit and it has a deep purple color, lots of cassis and blueberry fruits, notes of chocolate and graphite, building yet ripe tannins, a notable spine of acidity, and a great finish. One of the standouts in the lineup, this beautifully put-together red will evolve for 15 years. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Adobe Road Racing Series Redline shows power and trust in its palate-presence. TASTING NOTES: This wine delivers plenty of energy in its aromas and flavors of black fruit and tar. Pair it with grilled short ribs.

The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon is a medium to full-bodied, pretty, seamless, incredibly elegant 2018 that shows the style and quality of this great vintage to a T. Giving up notes of red and black fruits, violets, spicy oak, and dried herbs, it brings solid ripeness as well as a balanced, layered, focused mouthfeel. It should keep for 10-12 years. This densely layered, well concentrated wine emphasizes cocoa, dark chocolate and dried blueberry flavors that are firmly wrapped in fine-grained tannins. Expect it to mellow and gain more complexity with time. Best from 2028. "

A well-sculpted and luscious white, with apple pastry, peach and pear flavors that feature pastry notes. The spicy finish is long and rich-tasting. Drink now through 2023. The 2017 Chardonnay Vintner Select is a ripe, classic Sonoma Chardonnay that has lots of salty minerality in its stone fruits, brioche, white flower, and honeysuckle aromas and flavors.

The wine is a fascinating connection of the sun and the earth as they meet in the ripeness of fruit: all the near-explosive intensity doesn’t diminish the detail of its sour-cherry flavors. Their tartness checks the sweetness, creating light within all the extract. Currant and strawberry aromas and flavors are shy, with earth, spice and vegetal elements adding depth. There's a lot of fruit locked up here, with the dusty tannins leaving a compact feel on the finish. Best from 2024. "

There's real drive to this tightly meshed, mouthwatering Champagne, yet this is refined and creamy on the palate, with raw silky texture. Long, chalky finish.  Disgorged in December 2019 with 1.5 grams per liter dosage, the NV Rosé de Saignée L’Incandescent derives exclusively from the 2016 vintage and saw 28 hours of maceration before pressing. Offering up inviting aromas of plums, raspberries, cinnamon, orange rind and petals, it's medium to full-bodied, bright and vinous, with powdery phenolic structure, tangy acids and a fine-boned, elegant profile. This is a pretty but serious wine from Mouzon-Leroux that's well worth seeking out. The NV Extra Brut Rosé de Saignée L'Incandescent is a very pretty wine that melds together striking perfume with the taut feel that runs through all these Champagnes. Crushed red berry, chalk, slate and white pepper lend brilliance. I wish there was a bit more on the mid palate.

Seeing around 30% stems and 15 months in 60% new French oak, it has a wonderful bouquet of black raspberries, dark cherries, tobacco, California bay, and chocolatey spice. This carries to a medium to full-bodied Pinot Noir with a silky, seamless texture, polished tannins, nicely integrated acidity, and a great finish. I love the complexity here as well as the vibrancy in the fruit, and I think this is a small step up over the 2013. Mouthfilling and crunchy flavors of cherry, plum, currant and raspberry are well-integrated and backed by lively acidity. The finish is filled with spice and mineral accents. The 2015 Pinot Noir Trenton Estate Vineyard has mature aromas of dried red and black fruits with notes of mushroom, damp earth, potpourri and mossy bark. It's serious in the mouth with a firm frame and earthy undercurrent, lifted by good freshness and lilting citrusy accents, finishing long. "

Subtle, fruity finish. A pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2014 Alghero Cabernet Riserva Marchese di Villamarina draws on fruit from one of the largest estates in Italy, planted on a flat expanse of land in the island's northwestern Nurra region. This wine historically represents one of Sardinia's premier Cabernet Sauvignons, but the fruit here feels a little under the weather in this humid vintage: The wine starts up with intensity, but ultimately does not go the distance. It shows dark fruit aromas with cassis and myrtle, followed by tobacco, smoke and licorice. This expression ages in equal parts new and neutral oak, and the results are somewhere between mid- and full-bodied, with a finish that is moderate in length. Some 40,000 bottles were made.

The 2016 Barbaresco Tradizione moves over the palate with direct and silky intensity. Along the way, the wine imparts delicate tones of forest berry, wild cherry and rose hip. There are subtle hints of tar, button mushroom and tilled earth at the back. However, what I noticed most are the bright menthol notes that you get as the wine warms in the glass. This is a simple and easy-drinking Barbaresco to pair with your favorite pasta dishes. The wine is aged in botte grande only. "

They aimed for a fresh, fruit-driven and juicy red that comes from a low-yielding year, so the wine is concentrated but keeps the approachable style. It has nice balance. In warmer and riper years, they do shorter macerations at lower temperature and a short élevage to keep the aromatic and fruit-driven character, avoiding heavy wines. This is always a very good value within the Artadi range. "

3593,Emilio Hidalgo La Panesa Especial Fino,Sherry,Sherry,Spain,70,15,0.0,0,"“Fino Amontillado” is a style of Sherry that’s virtually extinct. It was made from old wines that had almost lost their flor and had begun to oxidize, their color darkening as they gained depth and complexity. Although La Panesa is not, strictly speaking, a Fino Amontillado, it has the characteristics of those wines from the past. With an average of 15 years of aging in solera (ten more than most Finos), it takes the lifespan of flor to the limit, creating a wine that’s intoxicating in its mineral and dried-fruit fragrance. Bone dry, saline flavors drive the wine from beginning to end, their abundance leaving no room for sweetness. This is the definition of verticality and elegance. The Fino La Panesa N/V is a reference for old Fino, pushing the limits of biological aging. Bottled at an impressive old age of 15 years from a solera created in 1961, it shows a deep golden color and a nose full of dried nuts (hazelnuts), elegant, complex and balanced, with intense salinity, pungent flavors, a full, wide palate and great length. This is a superb example of how to control the power of very old, biological Sherries. As with most of the NV wines, its impossible to distinguish the different bottlings so it""s hard to give a drinking window, because you""ll not know how old the bottle you have is, but the wine has the stuffing to last and even improve for a good five years. This is one of the greatest Finos in existence today."" This small producer in Jerez does not seek publicity but is worth tracking down. All the wines are excellent and several exceptional. The complex La Panesa is one for the grown-ups, at the very limit of flor ageing, at an average 15 years old. Shows lots of range, featuring singed persimmon, dried nectarine, walnut and green tea notes, with a long bitter almond note on the finish. A big fino with invigorating acidity. Tan in color and elegant beyond what's normal, this high-end fino shows full, complex aromas of honey, citrus, rancio, dried gouda cheese and nuttiness. It feels both easy and fresh, with dry, intense flavors of citrus and almond. Long and smooth on the finish, with zero burn or bite. "

Mostly Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, it comes in at 103 grams per liter of residual sugar. Rather nicely concentrated in terms of fruit flavor, this beautifully balanced Porto also has moderately ripe tannins, velvet for texture and a persistent finish. It coats the palate and delivers intense flavor on that finish, while the fruit is always lifted. Then, the tannins take over as the fruit recedes. Several days later, it was still drinking beautifully and it was surprisingly persistent, concluding with controlled tannic pop. The tannins may be ripe, but there are plenty of them. It took several days to open up again and become expressive again. There's plenty here to like, beginning with its enticing freshness and ending with the fact that it is delicious. A distinctly dry woodsy spine gives this a slightly austere bent, surrounded by ample fleshy boysenberry, blackberry and plum paste flavors. The finish is lined with alder and tobacco notes. A distinctive style. Time should tame this. Best from 2030 through 2042. Tasted twice, with consistent notes. "

This is an estate readers need to seek out. Lovely lavender and dried herbs on the nose and palate. Shot through with saturated fine tannin and juicy blackberry acidity. Plenty of detail, personality, power, freshness and great balance, this is a really satisfying glass of Crozes-Hermitage. The 2020 Crozes Hermitage immediately conjures visions of a wild blackberry thicket—slightly green, prickly, yet brimming with sweet fruit.

The vines at this site were replanted in 2008 and the fruit shows depth and authenticity, thanks to their advancing age. You get lingering mineral tones of rust and iron that marry this wine to a sense of place. The finish is bold but moderate in length. Very fresh and perfumed with oranges, cherries, raspberries and flowers. Medium-bodied with firm tannins and a racy, fine-tannined finish. Linear and racy. Give it time to soften. Try after 2024. The Scavino family bought 1.7 acres of vines in Prapò in 2009 and replanted a year later. Now in its third release, the 2017 bottling is rich and concentrated, the dark fruit flavors fully ripe and layered with notes of licorice and warm spice. Well-integrated and showing some power in its polished tannins, this wine will benefit from several years of cellaring. There is a hint of oak spice in the aromas, but the flavors are all about black cherry and blackberry fruit, accented by iron and tobacco.

Medium to full-bodied, with ripe, polished tannins and notable freshness, it's going to evolve for 15 years with no issues. This has a good, gutsy feel, with juicy and still slightly compact plum, raspberry and blackberry fruit flavors taking the lead, while licorice root, apple wood and dried garrigue hints fill in as well.

3730,Isole e Olena Cepparello,2018,Sangiovese,Italy,101,15,0.0,0,"A pure expression of Sangiovese, the 2018 Cepparello is a beautiful expression that speaks to the classic and most exemplary side of this versatile and deeply expressive grape. This vintage is especially bright and ethereal with a true sense of luminosity and clarity that radiates from both the wine's appearance and its fragrant bouquet. Tart cherry and cassis segue to balsam herb and wild violets. To the palate, the wine shows muscle and determination with sweet tannins and impressive depth of favor. Cepparello remains true to its unique identity in this vintage. The aromas of dark fruit and hazelnuts are so enticing, with undertones of licorice and slate. Medium to full body with round tannins and a savory finish. It’s so pretty to taste now. Just a hint of allspice at the end. Drinkable now, but better in 2023. Like the 2018 Chianti Classico, Cepparello shows no dilution, although the pure Sangiovese fruit gives a more austere structure. The sour cherry nose is lightly smoky but refined. Rich and very concentrated, the palate is supported by firm tannins that are in stark contrast to the breezier Chianti Classico. At present it's rather closed and furry, and needs time to harmonise and the tannins to integrate. The high alcohol doesn't show, and there's ample energy on the long finish. This bold Sangiovese has aromas of camphor, oak-driven spice and violet. The fullbodied, concentrated palate features dried cherry, steeped prune, licorice and coffee bean set against the heat of evident alcohol and assertive, closegrained tannins that clench the finish.

Balanced, with a great core of fruit, it’s a softer, more forward, charming wine than the grand vin and is ideal for drinking over the coming decade. Glistening ruby. Spice-accented dark berries and cherry on the nose, along with suggestions of garrigue and smoky minerals. Juicy blackberry, cherry cola and lavender flavors provide very good palate coverage and turn spicier with air. The floral note carries through a clinging, energetic finish shaped by smooth, well-knit tannins.  A grassy and fresh white with roughly 50% clairette, this has lemons and some lightly grassy nuances with a smooth palate that has melon-pastry flavors and smooth texture. Marked by hints of allspice and clove, the 2017 Chateauneuf du Pape Saintes Pierres delivers classic leather and cherry flavors. It's medium to full-bodied, yet silky and streamlined, well-balanced for its stated 15% alcohol. Drink it over the next 5–8 years. A traditional style, with a slightly dried edge to the mix of cherry, damson plum and red currant fruit, with a dusting of sandalwood and rooibos tea notes on the finish. Grenache and Syrah. "

As with the Imperial Gran Reserva, I found great balance and elegance here, transcending the character of the year. It's a little shy and takes time to show aromas of fine spices, decayed leaves, wild berries and flowers. It's full and round, faithful to its style, juicy and rich even in more austere years. It's tasty and dry and has the balance to develop nicely in bottle. Another one for the table. 30,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in June 2017. A tight and taut red.

Enjoy it with grilled lamb dishes. (Tasted: April 15, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Gritty olive and rubbery black-fruit aromas give this gran reserva an earthy, reduced opening. That's contrasted by sharp acidity, which brightens plum and savory berry flavors. Plum and chocolate notes come with coffee-like blackness on a finish where lively acidity reappears. Drink through 2026. Sleek and supple, this red offers cherry and red plum flavors, backed by licorice, graphite and smoky notes. Well-integrated tannins lend support, while orange peel acidity keeps this lively. Harmonious, in the traditional style. Tempranillo and Graciano.

The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is characterized by some of those same earthy notes of crushed limestone and baked clay that we saw so clearly in the other two entry-level red wines released by this estate. Wild cherry and dried raspberry cede to oregano, basil or balsam herb. However, overall the fruit intensity is faded. The tannins are on the dry side, and perhaps the heat of the vintage reveals itself there with greater clarity. This wine is best served in the near term. "

It gives up gregarious scents of mangoes, pineapple tart, peach cobbler and acacia honey with nuances of lime blossoms, spice cake and toasted almonds. Big, concentrated and sporting tons of exotic fruit and savory/nutty layers, the creamy texture is beautifully offset by a wicked backbone of freshness and a fantastically long finish. Yum!

The wine is modern and soft, showing lots of contained ripeness and creaminess, yet it successfully embraces the fundamentals of the appellation and Sangiovese, thanks to its bright acidity and finely tuned structure. Few wines reach this level of precision, especially in a challenging vintage such as this. To the northwest of Montalcino, Castello Romitorio’s vineyards are surrounded by thick woods receiving moderate sun exposure. The relatively cool setting was an advantage in 2017. Well put together with a graceful flow, this Brunello echoes its setting and opens with pronounced cedar and evocative forest floor accents. Neither heavy nor over-concentrated, the palate is replete with pulpy red berries. There is a succulence to the fruit and a silkiness to the texture, and nuances of pulverised stone weave throughout. Drinking Window: 2022 - 2029. Black cherry, blackberry, plum, iron, tobacco and spice flavors herald this brooding red, revealing a pliable feel midpalate, despite a matrix of stiff tannins that guard the finish. "

It comes in at 13.9% alcohol. Showing some charred beef on the finish, this does have the advantage of somewhat more sedate tannins—somewhat. This has good juicy fruit, but it doesn't seem as classic as some years in the flavor profile. It's a good but not really great Leda. Here, unlike with the 2017, the fruit doesn't compensate for some rusticity. Best after 2024. "

The Eden is elevated above the Barossa Valley, at an elevation of over 440 meters. The skeletal, podzolic soils veritably burst forth with rocks—quartz and granite—among the old, towering gums that sway in the wind... there's something incredibly evocative about the Eden Valley. With all of this in mind, at seven years of age today in 2022, this wine is spicy and enveloping but absolutely remains shackled to the rails of acidity and tension that this region is so good at. At no point through the finish does the fruit waver or deviate from the set path, telling us it has plenty of time left to go yet.  This has made the turn to a complex wine with intense citrus, lemon-butter and toasty notes in a fresh guise. The palate has a bright, succulent and gently creamy feel with a long line of acidity holding the lemon and toasty flavors long. Drink now. "

3873,Bodegas Benjamin Rothschild and Vega Sicilia Macan Clasico,2018,Tempranillo,Spain,64,14,0.0,0,"Their second wine in the Bordeaux sense is the 2018 Macán Clásico, which in the cooler and late year (they picked between October 2nd and 14th) fermented in stainless steel and matured in 50% new French oak barrels, 10% American oak barrel and 40% used ones for 12 months. The wine has moderate ripeness and alcohol (14%) in a fresher, subtler and more elegant year with good freshness (a pH of 3.75) and balance. It's young and creamy, a baby that will improve as it burns down that fat. Separating the press wine by quality and aging it separately seems to have increased the precision. It has to be one of the finest vintages for this wine; it is round and nicely textured. Aromas of blackberries and crushed stones with some black licorice and violets, following through to a medium body with a solid core of fruit and such attractive fruit and fine tannins at the finish. Really attractive now. A rainy year in Rioja and an abundant harvest. Tempranillo cherry is overlaid with fine cedar and spice, plus firm tannin, with crispness that comes bursting through. Elegant and very long, with a lighter style. With Macán Classico, winemaker Gonzalo Iturriaga is working towards less extraction and in 2017 began to work with gentler pressing. Aged for 12 months in barrique, 50% new (40% French and 10% American), and 50% one year old. "

3893,Col di Lamo Brunello di Montalcino,2015,Sangiovese,Italy,75,14,0.0,0,"This is a very pretty Brunello that shows fresh red cherries, strawberries, citrus, nutmeg, rose petals and cedar. Great combination of finesse and concentration. Silky tannins and chewy fruit are a winner. Full-bodied and powerful, yet agile.  The Col di Lamo 2015 Brunello di Montalcino is a standout wine that offers a great balance of dark fruit and savory spice. It is fruit-forward, but it hits all the classic Brunello selling points. It shows emphasis on the dark side of the wine (with black cherry, black currant and plum) that is very much in line with this vintage. You might get a hint of ripeness too, with some blackberry preserves and cherry confit, but despite that more overt softness, the wine fully shows the elegance of the vintage. It's a great effort for organic farming. This offers aromas of dark-skinned berry, tilled soil and a whiff of new leather. The savory, balanced palate delivers dried black cherry, staranise and tobacco alongside firm, youthfully austere tannins. Drink after 2023 "

It offers notes of red currants, sage brush, spice and licorice in a charming, elegant, sweetly fruited style. There’s a touch of herbaceousness that won’t be for everyone, but it should drink nicely for 5-7 years. "

This Palo Cortado, for example, comes from wines an average of 32 years old, in an oxidative process that seems to have removed everything superfluous, leaving only the essentials. It smells and tastes of sea breezes and albariza soil as white as chalk. Intense and slightly spicy, it attacks the palate with its vibrant acidity, the firm texture filled out with notes of nuts and green olives. Open the bottle to drink it over the course of a month, or maybe a year. Keep it in a cool, dark place and see what wonders oxygen will bring. A stylish palo cortado, with orange blossom, dried nectarine, green tea, ginger and date notes threaded with a subtle iodine edge through the finish. Rather high-toned, but this dances along beautifully. The N.V. Palo Cortado is a V.O.R.S. 32 years of age. Medium amber-colored, it has an exceptional bouquet of nuts, apricots, and marmalade.

The 2016 Finca Villacreces was produced to showcase the essence of the estate, mixing grapes from different soils fermented and aged separately and then blended into a combination of 88% Tempranillo, 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Merlot that fermented in concrete and oak vats and matured in 225- and 500-liter French oak barrels for 15 months. I was expecting more freshness here, but I found ripe black fruit and something earthy/organic reminiscent of peat and coal, plenty of fine-grained tannins and ripe and earthy flavors. It's still quite oaky. Surprisingly enough, the 2017 showed better... 71,242 bottles and 535 magnums produced. It was bottled in July 2018. "

This is a full 1% lower in alcohol, and it comes through as sharper and fresher with 13% alcohol and very good freshness with a pH of 3.15. It has a reductive personality with some flinty notes and hints of gunpowder that I like very much. It's a bit austere and closed; it's never going to be an exuberant wine but should develop more nuances in bottle.  "

These are big wines that are big but expertly balanced by slate and crushed stone minerality, giving balance and succulence. Subtle aromas of sweet berries, Spanish cedar and blackberries with some black mushrooms. Medium-to full-bodied with fine yet chewy tannins and a long finish. Solid and racy. Tight now. Drink after 2024. Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2018 Lassegue features expressive notes of stewed red and black plums, boysenberries and Black Forest cake, plus hints of damp soil, black truffles and tapenade.

Because they changed almost everything... They have 12 hectares of 35-year-old vineyards divided into eight different plots around the winery in the Val do Salnés plus one hectare they rent from the archbishopric. The soils are degraded and sandy granite and the pruning the traditional ""parrón,"" ""emparrado"" or pergola at 1.8 to two meters high. The grapes were picked between September 13th and 20th, let to settle and fermented in stainless steel at 10 degrees Celsius for 60 days. The wine was kept with the lees for two months and a further seven months in tank, but 15% of the wine matured in 225-liter acacia barrels. The wine was bottled in June 2020 and was kept in bottle for 16 months. It's 13% alcohol and has a pH of 3.4 and 7.8 grams of acidity (measured in tartaric acid per liter). The wine is extremely balsamic and medicinal, with an explosive nose with notes of white flowers, but the nose changes, as we know. What impressed me was the seamless structure and the harmony on the palate. It's titillating, elegant, detailed and nuanced, with terrific balance. I was gobsmacked! 95,097 bottles and 1,425 magnums produced. All bottles are numbered and in the same elegant bottle as La Comtesse. Obviously, the price has changed. A fruity nose of apple blossom, nectarine, candied pear, guava, lime cordial and some fresh cider. It’s medium-bodied with bright acidity and a juicy, ripe palate. Subtle saline notes. Round, delicious finish. This white has a smooth, luxurious texture, with lime, honey cream, white blossom and tangerine flavors that are matched with a hint of toast and ample spice elements.

It's nuanced but concentrated in the mouth, with a light to medium weight, fine-grained tannins and great freshness, finishing long and layered. Destemmed and aged all in neutral barrels, the 2016 Pinot Noir Sebastiano comes from a windy site located on the eastern end of the Sta. Rita Hills. It's a more reserved, closed wine now yet offers plenty of hefty dark fruits, earth, and underbrush aromas as well as a medium to full-bodied, textured style on the palate.

3932,Herdade do Mouchao Tinto,2013,Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,59,14,0.0,0,"From this large region’s most historic estate, 70% of the blend is Alicante Bouschet, showing exotically spicy black fruit aromas leading to structure and depth on the palate, great individuality, and freshness and acidity for the long term. Excellent. Drinking Window 2018 - 2030. The Reynolds family released their first bottling from their Mouchão estate in 1949, and it soon became a legendary wine in Portugal. The family had come to the Alentejo in the 1800s, as part of the cork trade, and settled on a ranch northeast of Estremoz, eventually planting vines in the 1870s when some professors from Montpellier traveled to the region with cuttings of a recent cross, alicante bouschet. This blend is a selection of the top parcels of alicante bouschet, and includes about 15 percent trincadeira, the grapes fermented in stone lagars, the wine aged in old wooden vats for three years, then another two in bottle prior to release. It starts out as a narrow, tense wine with a cool, spicy bite to the finish. Then it keeps developing over the course of hours and days, the wine’s alcohol completely incorporated into floral blueberry flavors, its youth showing in bright notes of bee pollen, more August than September or October. As it gains some fat and turns silken, the wine shows what it will become with another five to ten years in bottle. The 2013 Tinto, the regular estate bottling, is a 76/24 blend of Alicante Bouschet and Trincadeira. It was aged for 36 months in used 5,000-liter tonels of varying ages and comes in at 14% alcohol. Still elegant, this has fleshed out a bit and certainly doesn't seem thin. It does many other things brilliantly, though. Alternating silk and velvet for texture, it is simply sensual, and caressing on the palate. The nuanced finish with waves of beefy Alicante adds complexity. This is also a little restrained—the tannins are moderate, but they certainly increase with air. You can drink this now, but it should still improve and will steadily get better. This is lovely. I'm not convinced it is a truly great one yet, at least in the context of this winery's history. "

Fifty percent full clusters were used for the native fermentation in underground stone pools with a short maceration. It matured in 500-liter oak barrels and 5,000-liter oak vats for 12 months. It's a little lower in alcohol but shows ripeness (without excess), but the core is floral, perfumed and elegant.

Sort of shy. But this will develop really nicely with some bottle age. Drink after 2023. To my palate, the 2018 vintage sometimes feels a little too ripe or baked. I was reminded of those characteristics when tasting the Fèlsina 2018 Fontalloro. There is plenty of dark fruit at its core, but this wine also reveals dry tones of jarred oregano, grilled Mediterranean herb, crushed aspirin and graham cracker. The mouthfeel is pleasantly lean and silky, and perhaps the wine delivers more in terms of length than it does weight or texture. A little more bottle age should help flesh out and soften these results. The 2018 Fontalloro is bright, floral and full of energy. In most vintages, Fontalloro is quite open, but the 2018 is especially nervy and taut. That won't be an issue in time, of course, but readers should plan on being patient. Sangiovese is so expressive here. A whole range of floral and savory accents lingers on the close. Forest floor, toasted oak and camphor aromas mingle with dark spice on this 100% Sangiovese. Enveloping and elegantly structured, the savory palate delivers ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, mocha and licorice framed in fine-grained tannins.

It begins with haunting notions of chaparral and sagebrush, next offering white peaches, spring honey, roasted almonds and matchstick scents. The generous palate balances intellectual intrigue with sheer deliciousness, featuring satiny waves of herbal fruit that continue to evolve over a tremendously long finish. I love this hedonistic expression and would be inclined to drink it on the earlier side. Best After 2022 "

Medium to full body. Linear and bright finish. Shows focus and beauty. One of the best riservas from here in years. The 2016 Chianti Classico Riserva Croce reveals a dark and enriched quality of fruit with blackberry, plum, blackcurrant and exotic spice. Despite the power and concentration of the bouquet, though, the mouthfeel does not open to the same magnitude or power. This wine tapers down in terms of texture and palate impact, and this is a good thing. The wine is big on top (at the aromatic level) and more streamlined in texture.

A precise, even reductive style typical of the estate, it has an amazing definition of violet, rose and rhubarb melded with balsamic whiffs and savoury liquorice in depth. Firm acidity and tannins dominate the palate with elegance and integration; a woven structure which flows with dusty, ripe tannins and lifted freshness. More elegant than powerful, its quintessentially Barbaresco and not without sufficient concentration for ageing. A pretty mineral nose showing blood orange, rust and a racy, dark raspberry and cranberry character. A hint of dry earth and vanilla as well. Very firm and sinewy with a medium-to full-bodied palate, showing impressive purity and fine grip. Very well-made.  The Massolino 2019 Barbaresco offers fine and delicate fiber with plenty of wild berry, blue flower, licorice and crushed stone. With 10,000 bottles produced, this wine remains a fresh and accessible taste of Nebbiolo from the gentle hills of Barbaresco. "

There is both good richness and volume to the delicious and sappy medium-bodied flavors that possess solid mid-palate density, all wrapped in a moderately firm and highly complex finale that isn't as dry as the zero dosage would normally suggest. This is one of those Champagnes that is showing ample maturity and if super-fresh and youthful fruit is your preference, this isn't for you. With that said I underscore that this is not made in an oxidative style either. A firm version, yet well-knit and lacy in texture, offering aromas and flavors of juicy white cherry, raspberry, salted Marcona almond and honeycomb. Delivers hints of spices and herbs on the finish.

A light dessert wine that can be enjoyed with many different types of food, from sweet to savory.

It was in bottle for about four months when tasted, so there were no issues there. This is the newest release of our trio this issue. Petros Markanatos of the winery says that this was a good vintage, with harvest occurring ""8-10 days later than usual,"" resulting in strong flavors. Concentrated and relatively full-bodied for the brand, this lacks the nuance of the 2016 (or even the 2017) this issue, but it also illustrates how much fun young ones can sometimes be. I'm not so sure this has the structure of the 2016 or the richness of the 2017, but it seems to lean closer to that 2017 in style. Meanwhile, given its youth, it is pure and fruit forward, with a delectable finish. Of course, ""fruit forward"" for Robola still means dry and crisp. There's nothing sweet and simple here. Overall, this looks like it has some promise, but it needs to show good development to go with its early accessibility. It's worth leaning up today. At the moment, it would be my least favorite of this issue's group. It is true that the competition is stiff and this 2020 is young. "

A heady musky perfume envelops the senses. There’s a bit of onion peel reduction, but the passion fruit, lime, grapefruit and fresh green bell pepper notes win out. The palate is dry with persistent, mouth[1]puckering acidity. Though this wine is still very young, its bones are strong. It just needs another year or two in the bottle to flesh out some more. "

Serve it with whole fish roasted in a wood oven. The minerality of this pure Chardonnay shows how close the Côte des Bar is to the vineyards of Chablis. It has a chalky texture as well as ripeness, a crisp and structured wine. This bottling is a little young and will repay waiting few months, so drink from late 2017.

The palate is extremely well balanced with a killer line of acidity that cuts a swath through the rich honeyed fruit. Notes of tangerine, peach and mango appear toward the finish. Irresistible.  Medium gold in the glass, the 2020 Straw Wine opens to a gorgeous, honeyed and sweet citrusy nose that exudes power, elegance and precision. Aromas of quince paste, apple cider reduction and sappy honeysuckle flowers waft from the glass with a kiss of volatility and notions of candied Meyer lemon and raw honeycomb. Medium to full-bodied and with only 7.5% alcohol, the weight of this wine is impressive—it is mouth-coating with a generous lusciousness and sweetness yet still possesses the laser-beam acidity of Chenin Blanc. The wine continues to evolve on the palate as it unpacks and unfolds its secrets over the somersaulting and seemingly never-ending finish. Bravo! I know that the majority of the world tends to think of France's Loire Valley when it comes to Chenin Blanc, but with expressions like this from South Africa, the world will wake up one day and realize just how important and significant this variety is to South Africa and what potential it has in capable hands. This wine has me thinking. It's so unique and tastes as if Quarts de Chaume from Loire and Vendange Tardive from Alsace were to collide. "

Baked plum, raspberry and blueberry fruit match a core of gamy intensity and elements of iron, leather and violet, the texture layered and thick. Deeply structured yet retains finesse, offering smoked meat, blueberry and grilled sweet anise flavors that build tension toward medium-grained tannins. Best from 2023 through 2030. The Dutton family farms this syrah on a ridgetop in Green Valley, just north of the Petaluma Gap, where the vines date to 1991. The cool, fog-influenced site produced a classic coastal syrah, its red fruit touched by Persian spices and hints of roses. The tension in its structure suggests a long life ahead. "

(Tasted: January 31, 2021, San Francisco, CA) It pours on the power. It strikes blow after blow of thick, sweet, dense flavour. Blackberry, honey, soy and malt, inflections of mint and cloves, a churn of grainy, muscular tannin. There's real flex here, real grunt. You either succumb or you stand out of its way. Red berry flavours add a brighter note; a light on a mountain of flavour. An almost Rhône-ish note of green olive on the nose gives the 2015 100 Year Old Vines Shiraz a bit extra complexity and intrigue. That note is layered over raspberry fruit, hints of vanilla and baking spices and a bit of cocoa. It's full-bodied but not heavy or overly extracted, with gentle, silky tannins that linger elegantly on the finish. Intense plum, spice and licorice flavors are plush and expressive, with a juicy side and velvety tannins. Cedar, tobacco and nutmeg accents linger on the generous finish.

The mouthfeel is fleshy, almost generous, with solid wood-grilled apple and orange oil flavors that carry through to the close. Ample acidity and a pleasant texture kicks in to enliven the feel, with lovely spiced orange tea and dried fynbos tones lingering on the close.

A whiff of flint precedes fresh lemon notes that pervade the entire wine with vivid freshness. The palate is taut and bright, with a rather salty, iodine savoriness. Lovely depth from the great proportion of reserve wines. The finish is brisk, with citrus and umami. Apricot, dried apple, dried lemon, shortbread and almond on the nose. Medium-bodied with sharp acidity and fine bubbles on the creamy, biscuity and dry palate. Very fresh and balanced. Drink now The NV Brut Première Cuvée (Disgorged 07/2016) has a bright straw-gold color.

Nice purity. This is a highly elegant, fresh, textured and tightly woven but very well balanced cuvée with lovely purity and a persistently salty, citrus-fresh and cleansing finish with good grip.

Fresh acidity lends brightness and balance. Best After 2022 A wonderful young Chianti Classico with aromas and flavors of black cherries, dark chocolate, wet earth and black truffle. It’s full-bodied with creamy and juicy tannins and a long, flavorful finish. The 2018 Chianti Classico is fabulous. Deep, rich and super-expressive, the 2018 captures the essence of the house style, with a dollop of Cabernet Sauvignon that adds both complexity and structural intensity. Black cherry, plum, licorice, lavender and dried herbs are kicked up a few notches. This is an especially rich style for the year, but it works so well. The Castello dei Rampolla 2018 Chianti Classico shows some softness and extra ripeness with dark fruit and plum followed by savory smoke and spice. This wine is an expression of the one and only Panzano in Chianti, a promising subzone in the larger Chianti Classico appellation with panoramic views awash in soft golden light at the end of each glorious day. To the palate, the wine delivers rich, mid-weight intensity with more textured and succulent flavors to follow. This wine is just lovely, especially when tasted right out of the gate when those cherry and blackberry tones are at their brightest. "

(Tasted: September 12, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The NV Brut Nature Blanc de Blancs Cuvée des Chevaliers Grand Cru melds together the verve of Côtes de Blancs Chardonnay with an extra touch of vibrancy from the no dosage style, an approach that works beautifully here. Vivid and chiseled, the Cuvée des Chevaliers is naturally taut. But there is more than enough depth for the fruit to keep the wine from being austere. This is such a gorgeous and expressive Champagne. The latest rendition of Lacelot-Royer's NV Brut Nature Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Cuvée des Chevaliers delivers aromas of honeycomb, almond paste, crisp orchard fruit and white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, pillowy and precise, with bright acids and a fleshy core of fruit, it's seamless and nicely balanced. This is a fine effort that comes recommended. "
4401,Zenato Lugana Riserva Sergio Zenato,2018,Trebbiano,Italy,44,13.5,0.0,0,"The 2018 Lugana Riserva Sergio Zenato blossoms in the glass, as a whiff of vanilla bean and almond paste give way to a pretty mix of crushed yellow apples, nectarine and gingery spice. This is deeply textural, almost oily in feel, with a dense wave of mineral-tinged orchard fruits that coast along a core of brisk acidity. It leaves the palate reverberating with citrus tension, yet also an enriching air of custard that balances it all out. The Riserva is fermented in a combination of 70% oak casks, which adds amazing depth and body without taking away from the zesty character of the Trebbiano di Lugana variety, and in 30% stainless steel tank. The Zenato 2018 Lugana Riserva Sergio Zenato is redolent of peach, baked apple and honeycomb. This medium-bodied wine from a 60-hectare vineyard site with clay soils is nicely textured and spicy. This wine paints a pretty portrait of the elaborate side of the Trebbiano di Lugana grape that is gaining in popularity. The Zenato family was one of the first to offer it. With handmade-looking paper labels, there were 18,000 numbered bottles released. A rich and creamy white defined by vibrant acidity, this offers a fragrant range of lemon curd, poached apricot and pastry cream flavors with accents of smoke and toasted almond. Lingering, mineral- and herb-laced finish. Drink now through 2026. "
4402,Titus Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,64,14.5,4.5,6,"An intense, sweet nose with lots of ripe, almost candied blackberries and blueberries. Some vanilla and pine wood, too.

The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon is a terrific value and has a classic Napa style in its ripe plum and mulberry fruits as well as toasty oak and chocolate-like aromas and flavors. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has ripe, supple tannins and the classic forward, delicious style of the vintage. Drink it over the coming 10-12 years as well. Best After 2022 The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon is vibrant and full of energy. Sweet red cherry, mocha, spice, new leather and licorice are nicely layered in this mid-weight, polished Cabernet Sauvignon. I would give the 2019 a year or two in bottle and then enjoy it over the next decade or so. Best After 2024 "

Evoking enticing aromas of orange marmalade, honey, medjool dates and almond blossom, the palate continues along similar lines. Unctuous and intensely sweet, there’s just enough acidity keep this from syrup territory. It would benefit enormously from a creamy, salty cheese pairing.  The NV Rosewood Vineyards Muscat appears only slightly less complex than the Muscadelle. Possessing a very pale brown color with a glint of gold, this wine is quite grapey on the nose with notes of brandied sultanas and spice cake. In the mouth it’s very sweet and rich with relatively medium-high acid to balance. The finish is very long with flavors of spicy grape syrup. As with the Muscadelle, this is also an amazing value. Here's a steal: a half bottle of rich, stylish muscat for $16. This is filled with luscious, plump peach flavor, perfumed tart cherry notes with a rummy, sugarcane sweetness in the finish. Serve it with hazelnut ice cream. "

The 2017 Vintage Port is mostly Touriga Nacional (70%), with the rest Touriga Franca, aged for 20 months in neutral tonels. It comes in with 89 grams of residual sugar. This was in bottle only a couple of weeks when tasted. This seems rich and fruity on opening, but not much more. Its fruit is just delicious, but I didn't get the sense of structure I saw from the 2016 last year. Yet, with two hours of air in a glass, this really blossomed, showing fine power, more focus and a serious backbone to go with its ripe fruit. This is another fine Romaneira, but I'm not sure yet that it exceeds the performance of the fine 2016. We will have to see how that goes in time and over the years. Dense, ripe and already open, this is a concentrated wine that has balanced tannins and juicy black currant fruits. Its richness is tempered by the fresh, dry streak of acidity and tannins.

Over the last few years, the Vajras have tamed some of the rusticity of Freisa, but there is still plenty of varietal character here. All the elements are very well balanced. Wild cherry, plum, spice, licorice, tobacco, grilled herbs and coffee abound. I would give the 2017 a year or two in bottle, as there is still a bit of edginess to the tannin. Then again, that is Freisa, when it is made with this level of ambition. This wine has developed its own cult following over the years. Named after a local dialectal expression for ""who is it,"" the 2017 Langhe Freisa Kyè is super intense in this hot vintage. The wine draws upon those vintage conditions to present an extra dark appearance, with aromas of Morello cherry, dried blackberry and spice.

Their freshness, good acidity, soaring aromatics, and unctuous flavors must be tasted to be believed. The real values are the less expensive cuvees generally produced from 5- to 6-year-old solera systems... The Victoria Tawny exhibits a medium garnet color in addition to sweet, unctuous strawberry and cherry fruit. It is a blend of four grapes, Carina, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, and Shiraz.

A complex Manzanilla blended from wines five years of age, it has the freshness of the sea breeze in Sanlucar, making it an ideal aperitif. How can one not love this wine? When I close my eyes and let the Orleans Borbon Manzanilla Fina aroma's take me over, I imagine fresh breezes from the ocean air. This wine is incredibly alluring, focused and delicious, perfect with sashimi. Medium straw color, strong and focused aromas of rancio and nuttiness, excellent depth; medium bodied, lively and persistent on the palate; dry, fine acidity, well balanced; rancio, salty and briny flavors, excellent; medium finish, crisp aftertaste.

Fermented in oak and stainless steel and aged on the lees for about eight months, the 2019 opens with a deep and intense, concentrated and mineral-scented nose of crushed stones, iodine and deep and spicy, serious blackcurrant fruit. Full-bodied, rich, intense and fine on the palate, this is a round and firmly structured Sancerre with spicy polyphenols and a stimulating salty and piquant finish. This is a dense and mouth-filling, textural wine that I like a lot because the fruit is not up front but spicy and intense. Excellent aging potential. 13.5% stated alcohol. Natural cork. A fruity and elegant pinot noir with notes of cherries, red berries, wet earth, peppermint and a mossy undertone. It’s medium-bodied with firm tannins and bright acidity. Vivid and joyful with a tight, succulent finish. Drink now. "

Generally speaking, vintners in Montalcino did an excellent job in the hot 2017 vintage by producing wines that are not jammy or baked. However, this wine definitely embraces a warm-vintage personality, and it flirts with the denser and softer side of Sangiovese. Oak spice and smoked tones help to flesh out this open and accessible release of 30,000 bottles. This Brunello is ready to go straight out of the gate. A big and rich Rasina with chocolate, berry and hints of meat. It’s full-bodied with round and juicy tannins and a long finish. Fresh at the end. Different and richer Brunello style from here.

She ferments with ambient yeasts in stainless steel, where the wine ages, before bottling, unfined and unfiltered. The wine’s stamina is apparent from the moment it’s first poured, “a rollercoaster in the mouth,” said Tina Vaughn, describing it as elegant and sexy. The youthful floral aspects of the wine develop from green-grape freshness toward gentian and rosebud as it opens with air, tight, refreshing, just on the edge of powerful.

Bright acids give the orchard fruit, citrus confit and floral notes a good bit of energy. There is a lot to like here. Light tropical accents develop with air, rounding out the finish nicely. Starting with the 2018 Chardonnay Anderson Valley Alesia from the value-priced lineup from Rhys, it offers a vivid gold hue as well as bright, Chablis-like notes of lemon curd, salty, chalky minerality, crushed citrus, and a kiss of sappy flowers. These carry to a more medium-bodied Chardonnay that shows more sweet fruit and texture than you'd expect from the nose, and it's a charming, fleshy, ready to go beauty to enjoy over the coming 2-4 years.

It's mostly Tempranillo with some Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot and has 13.9% alcohol. It fermented with neutral yeasts followed by an élevage that lasted 12 months in 70% used barrels, 20% new ones and 10% in concrete eggs.

You can never go wrong in buying a Le Mont and in particular this one. This is a great effort from a very particular vintage that forced the harvest team to make the strictest selections. It was well worth the effort. A harmonious white, with vivid complexity, offering glazed yellow fig, persimmon and Bosc pear notes intertwined with ginger, chamomile, marzipan and heather details.

4710,Quinta de Chocapalha Vinha Mae,2015,Other Red Blends,Portugal,41,14.5,3.9,16,"Vinha Mãe is a sibling to Chocapalha’s CH (also recommended here). It includes three varieties from the family’s original planting three decades ago: touriga nacional, syrah and tinta roriz, blended here in almost equal amounts. Fermented without stems in lagars, this aged for 20 months in French oak barriques, developing into a wine that’s gritty and grand. Open it and you’ll taste the flavor of fat grapes ripened to violet-purple intensity. Wait a bit and you’ll find more floral notes, rose and orange oil, adding a sense of sweetness even as the gentle tannins keep it dry. You can breathe the earthy smoke of the tannins after each sip, lengthening the savor of this beefy red, leaving a pretty impression. Elegant and well-crafted, this full-bodied red offers cherry, crushed red plum and raspberry notes that are pure and focused. Details of mineral, dried violet and licorice are lined with dusty, full tannins. Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Syrah. The 2015 Vinha Mãe is the current release. Chocapalha holds wines back to allow development in the bottle, so that's a fair part of the price you're paying. It is a roughly equal blend of Tinta Roriz, Touriga Nacional and Syrah aged in 30% new French oak for 20 months. Very elegant, this graceful red has substance but finesse, plus some grip on the finish. It's beautifully balanced and constructed—a hallmark of the winery—and should develop over the next decade. "

On the breezy slope of the Ruffoli hill in Greve, Poggio Scalette’s vineyards extend from 410 to 585 metres on sandy, stony soil. Despite fermentation and ageing in cement vats, scents of sweet spice, clove and nutmeg seem to suggest oak. Dark currant fruit provides a backdrop on the grippy, zippy palate. It's rather angular at the moment but with lots of character and an appealing bitter grapefruit peel accent which lingers on the finish. "

Its lemon curd and pineapple flavors are girded by a sturdy oak frame, firm with plenty of leesy grip. This shows dramatic tension and freshness for a four-year-old wine, fine and focused, the lemony accents firmed up by a salty tang and majestic oak elements. For the cellar.

This 60,000-bottle release is beautifully balanced. In addition to the creaminess of the Chardonnay and the slightly more lifted bouquet shaped by the two aromatic grapes (the Sauvignon Blanc and the Gewürztraminer), the wine feels dry, elegant and mineral driven. Underripe pear and white fruit add pretty tartness and considerable tension to this medium-bodied white. Salty notes last long on the finish. It ages in botte grande for 11 months. The upfront aromas of yellow grapefruit and ripe gooseberry are classic sauvignon blanc, but as it aerates, pear and ripe apple notes emerge. On the palate, there’s a parallel, nicely intertwined combination of brightness and creaminess, until you splash land in the juicy, exotic finish. Just reaching it’s best drinking form, but still fresh. A cuvee based on chardonnay with sauvignon blanc, gewurztraminer and pinot blanc. Drink or hold.

With just 13% alcohol, this Viognier is fleet of foot, with restrained fruit and spicy lift and drive. Lively fresh ginger leads the way, with pops of candied fennel and pastis to its subtle poached pear, white nectarine and honeysuckle-edged apricot flavours. Wild yeast and lees-ageing bring a touch of funk (and texture) to nose and palate. Bright straw-yellow. Mineral-accented scents of fresh pear, peach and violet are sharpened by a building citrus zest nuance. Silky and energetic on the palate, offering concentrated orchard and pit fruit, Meyer lemon and candied ginger flavors and a hint of honeysuckle. Closes with repeating florality, a hint of smokiness and impressive, mineral-driven persistence. A very direct, apricot, pear and white-peach nose with a strong, stone-fruit focus and some nutty notes. The palate has a very succulent feel with boldly fleshy, mouth-filling presence. Creamy and long. Flamboyant. Yalumba pioneered this rare Rhône variety in Australia, and its 2018 The Virgilius Viognier boasts copious apricot aromas and flavors. It's not overly floral but delivers lovely stone fruit notes, perhaps with a touch of cantaloupe. Medium to full-bodied, this classic expression of the variety is gently silky-creamy in texture, with a long, silky finish. Compared to early versions of this wine (first made in 1998), the oaking is really subtle these days, which Chief Winemaker Louisa Rose attributes to the increased use of puncheons (500-liter barrels) instead of barriques. Yalumba’s and Australia’s best known Viognier is a medium-bodied, food-friendly number, if currently a bit jangly. The nose is bright and appealing with notes of lime blossom, ground ginger, and apple and peach still on the tree. The palate carries these flavors through to the finish, but the acidity and oak never quite knit together, nor is the texture interesting enough to get past it. Nevertheless, Viognier fans should enjoy the honeyed complexity this will gain with time. Drink 2022–2028. "

TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of black fruit and licorice, with a hint of oak. Pair it with a grilled, well-marbled ribeye. (Tasted: April 10, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Asphalt, espresso and black olive notes define the nose of the 2015 Ben Schild Reserve Single Vineyard Shiraz. Savory and complex, it does reveal some blackberry fruit with air. It's full-bodied and velvety on the palate, with slightly coarse-grained tannins providing texture and length on the finish. It's a solid effort and doesn't show a ton of oak, despite having spent 18 months in barrel. Blackberry and blueberry flavors are juicy, accented by touches of cola, spice and peppermint oil.

The 2015 Emmolo Plumerai—made from a vineyard experiment where the winery used a brush to remove more than half the grapes on every cluster—is a different wine. TASTING NOTES: This is a full-flavored, smooth wine. It's unusually low alcohol—a mere 12.4% and high acidity put it a different category. Its ripe melon and citrus notes are bright and lively and should provide a perfect pairing with a dozen thick and plump raw oysters. (Tasted: May 11, 2018, San Francisco, CA) "

The 2016 Vintage Porto is a mostly an equal blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, with various others comprising the last 20% of the juice. It comes in with 95 grams of residual sugar. This was in bottle about two months when tasted. Dark in color, with fine and expressive fruit, this shows intensity of flavor more than pure power. The fruit demonstrates nice lift as it opens with air. As with the Offley, this is a very nice success in this vintage, showing me fine fruit and reasonable structure. The concentration is good too, but it's not quite as impressive as the first two components. It is still excellent overall, the most exuberant of the three Sogrape Portos. We'll see how it ages and develops. For the moment, it is worth leaning up. Tightly knit nose, with firm berry fruit plus more savory, meaty lines.

I love its purity as well as its balance, and it shows the lively, fresher style of the vintage nicely. Cedar shavings and pineapple mark the nose of the 2020 Crozes Hermitage Le Pontaix Blanc. Crisp and structured, this medium-bodied wine—the product of old-vine Marsanne grown on loess and granite near the village of Crozes-Hermitage—is out of the ordinary for the appellation, yet it works, showing ample concentration, focus and length.

Quite a serious tannin structure that’s married to crisp, mineral acidity. All this needs some time to fully harmonize, but this should age well. From organically grown grapes. Drinkable now, but best after 2023. Glistening ruby. Fresh red and blue fruits, violet and baking spices on the highly perfumed nose. Juicy and gently chewy in texture, offering sappy cherry and boysenberry flavors that flesh out and turn sweeter through the mid-palate.

It’s reminiscent of lemon candy, marzipan, raw almonds and butterscotch. A wonderfully zingy, lemony acidity and persistent mousse lifts the palate. It’s remarkably ripe considering England’s climate, but balance, length and freshness abound. No doubt here, the Hattingley Valley Classic Reserve Sparkling Wine puts England on the map as a bona fide producer of bubblies. This wine exhibits pleasing aged character and a long and crisp aftertaste. This is a perfect choice as an aperitif wine. (Tasted: January 17, 2018, San Francisco, CA USA) Disgorged in February 2019, the latest rendition of the NV Brut Classic Reserve is showing well, exhibiting scents of yellow orchard fruit, apricot, dried white flowers and crushed chalk.

It’s there in a kind of white-clay dustiness that underlies the yuzu blossom and lemon curd notes, the wine subtly rich, with a roasted-nut depth of flavor. For chilled prawns and romesco sauce.

Made with Nebbiolo, Vespolina and Croatina, this has aromas of eucalyptus, ripe berries, rose and a whiff of cellar floor that eventually blows off. Focused and linear, the rather austere palate offers red cherry, white pepper and ground clove alongside tight, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2023–2028. "

The white-golden colored NV Extra Brut Reserve, disgorged after 36 months with a dosage of two grams per liter in July 2021, offers a clear, deep, fresh and intense, well-concentrated, quite complex and mineral-defined bouquet of white, ripe fruits, cherries and chocolate intertwined with brioche aromas and flinty tones. On the palate, this is a rich and mouth-filling, very generous but precise and structured blend of colored grapes. The wine is full-bodied, intense and complex, and with this well-dosed richness, no gram of dosage will be missed. The finish reveals refreshing lemon aromas and otherwise rather red-wine notes such as cherries and black berries. In any case, this Extra Brut is utterly fresh and exciting. "

The combination is palate-whetting and powerful enough to stand up to a creamy mushroom fricassee. Where are the salads? Where is the pasta? Brimming with red apples, this is crisp and extremely animating with a pretty dry balance, the harmonious finish totally food-friendly. The 2019 Zeltinger Himmelreich Riesling Kabinett halbtrocken is clear yet intense and bright on the coolish, precise and elegant nose. Round, lush and piquant on the palate, this is a dense and textured Kabinett with good concentration and a crystalline mineral structure that leads to stimulating acidity.

Bouncy and chewy, the tannins are woven into the fruit. Fruit, oak, acid and tannins are integrated and elegant, showing cohesion and harmony from the get-go. Cool-climate elegance is the lasting impression of this wine, as is the fine, chalky tannin profile that ultimately carries the fruit over the course of the palate. Very detailed. Margaret River can be responsible for seriously beautiful shiraz – this is one. Red-cherry flavors meet the firm acidity of bitter melon in this sweet and tannic shiraz. The fruit is full enough to completely saturate those tannins, setting the wine up for barbecued brisket and burnt ends. This 2018 vintage shows all the perfume, vivid fruit and oak spice we've come to expect from the “Art Series” Shiraz, with more power on the palate than in previous years. Vivid aromas of black currant, licorice, florals and sweet oak spice lead to a mouthful of tannins. They're chewy and a bit drying, but they don't entirely muffle the lifted acidity and attractive fruit and floral flavors. Give this another year or two in bottle for those tannins to knit into the wine and then drink until 2030 or so. "

5173,Mendel Malbec,2020,Malbec,Argentina,26,14.6,4.0,20,"A perfumed red with notes of fresh wild berries, just-picked violets, sweet spices and cocoa-dusted walnuts. Medium-to full-bodied with layers of plush, polished tannins and a lingering, silky mouth-feel. Velvety and seamless with delicious blue-fruit and blue-flower character. Drink or hold. The estate 2020 Malbec was produced with grapes from their property in Mayor Drummond (Finca Mendel) that was planted in 1928. It fermented in stainless steel and matured in French oak barrels, one-third each new, second and third use, for 12 months. It has 14.5% alcohol and a soft and round palate with integrated acidity. De la Mota thinks this 2020 is very representative of the zone of Lujan even if they harvest it a little earlier, and it has a little more fresh fruit, using the oak to keep that character, a balance between ripe and fresh fruit that is very interesting. It is juicy and primary with very fine tannins. A wine that overdelivers for the price. 88,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2021. Best After 2022. "

So juicy and seductive on the palate, this has a depth which is beguiling, layering the dark fruit, herbal and salty flavours on the tongue - a sweet, sticky almost liquorice blackcurrant added to by a black pepper and minty aftertaste giving some minerality to the palate.

In a weighty style, but surprisingly energetic as well, offering sweet cherry cola, mocha and vanilla flavors that turn spicier on the back half. This is showing a lot of oak influence right now, but there appears to be ample fruit to back it up. Finishes long and smoky, with a reverberating dark berry note and strong tenacity. Best after 2024. This wine, which spent 16 months in French oak, slightly more than half of it new, retains tight and compact flavors of brambly blackberries, herbs and lightly composted earth.

sauce, blueberry reduction and raspberry pâte de fruit flavors glide along
effortlessly. Notes of violet, anise and black tea are beguiling in the
background before melding seamlessly on the finish. This shimmers with
fruit, balanced by depth and spine. Best from 2035 through 2055. This is an unusually powerful vintage of Warre’s— “A huge wine,” said Craig Ganzer, a rare-wine appraiser who joined our 2017 Porto panel. “As big and rich as it is, it’s not clunky or cloying.” The power and mass comes from different sides, including a heavy drape of oak and a complete range of fruit at what feels like optimal ripeness, with raspberry and darker blueberry notes creating a mouthwatering sensation. Notes of hibiscus and pressed flowers tie directly into the tannins through the wine’s beeswax density. This has the remarkable integration that is a hallmark of the vintage, and a vinous character that should be fascinating to revisit as the wine ages. A ripe, floral wine that has many layers of black fruits with a fresh touch of acidity. The wine is dense while also elegant and poised with tannins and fruit already in balance. That suggests the Port will age relatively quickly. Drink from 2025. "

It’s medium-to full-bodied with fine bubbles and a dry finish. From organically grown grapes. Drink now. The NV Brut Rosé Reserve offers a pure and fresh yet intensely aromatic bouquet of red berries intertwined with delicate brioche and lemon juice aromas as well as some flinty notes. Round and fruity on the palate, this is a well-balanced, very charming, finely structured and stimulating sparkling blend of the Kamptal's red grape varieties such as Pinot Noir and St. Laurent. This vinous and finessed rosé drinks perfectly well as an aperitif but has enough fruit and structure to be enjoyed with many lighter dishes based on veggies, white meat or fish. Disgorged with a dosage of just two grams per liter, this is in fact an extra brut or brut nature. This sparkler is open and airy in texture, offering graphite, cherry and a slightly oxidative nutty flavor, which adds to the complexity. It’s vinous, with a long mineral-driven finish. It’s perfect for sipping, but add some food to fully enjoy it. Fred Loimer blends this wine from biodynamically farmed zweigelt, pinot noir and St. Laurent, fermented first in stainless-steel tanks, then a second time in bottle, where it rests for 18 months before disgorgement.

The slightly tongue-in-cheek tech sheet suggests you pair it with “three shrimp, six oysters, and a cornet of French fries,” but we disagree—given the finish, you should have time for at least four shrimp. Lightly creamy and bright, this Champagne impresses for its pleasing harmony, with citrusy acidity enlivening the white cherry, lime blossom, green almond and minerally saline notes. Disgorged July 2018. Drink now through 2021. Disgorged in May 2017, the intensely yellow colored NV Cuvée des Moines Brut (green label) offers a rich and aromatic but fine and elegant nose with subtle mineral or chalky notes as well as citrus and tropical fruit (pineapples). Round, intense and slightly nutty, this is a full-bodied, charming, intense and elegant cuvée assembling Pinot Meunier with Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This wine combines richness and hedonism with purity and precision. It has a long, sharp, well-defined finish. Excellent in quality and style. Brioche and pie-crust character mixes nicely with cooked apples and lightly grilled lemons. Medium-bodied, tight and focused with a solid center-palate of attractive fruit and a lightly candied lemon undertone. Disgorged January 2022. Drink now With its high percentage of Pinot Meunier, a house signature, this Champagne is full of fruit that gives crispness to the relatively high dosage. The wine is balanced, creamed apples working well with the acidity and minerality. "

It’s medium-to full-bodied with firm, fine tannins that are integrated with a flavorful finish. Juicy with lots of flavor. Approachable now, but better in 2024. Aromas of ripe wild berry, blue flower and forest floor mingle with a balsamic whiff of camphor. Full-bodied and firmly structured, the palate offers ripe black-skinned berry, raspberry compote, licorice and menthol alongside tightly knit, fine-grained tannins. As its name suggests, this wine draws its fruit from five crus across the appellation. They are Brunate, Liste, Cerequio, Cannubi and Raviole. The 2017 Barolo Lecinquevigne is balanced and bright. If there are leading qualities to assign to the Damilano family wines, they are consistency and accessibility. This medium-term 2017 is linear and less constructed overall, and you do sense some of the ripeness of the vintage, thanks to that sweet spot on the close. Sweet red cherry and berry flavors are augmented by spice, tar and wild herbs in this lightly chewy red. Firm and finishes on the dry side in the balance, yet with fine length.

5466,Warre's Otima 20 year Old Tawny Port,(500ML),Port,Portugal,44,20,4.4,44,"Warre’s NV Otima 20 Year Tawny Port is great value in Tawny Port and is well worth seeking out. Offering a touch of Rancio-like sourness in its nutty, salty, fig, caramel, and dried orange aromas and flavors, this beauty hits the palate with tons of sweet fruit, yet always stays balanced, pure, and elegant. It’s would be a great aperitif with almonds or smoked nuts, as well as pair beautifully with any number of desserts. This is a smooth and richly ripe wine. It has a dry character that brings out the wood aging and the dried fruit flavors that are well in balance. There is a tang of spirit that gives a lift to the wine. Acidity and a dry aftertaste complete an impressive tawny. Very plush, with a buttery essence to the dried white fruit and nutty flavors. Elegantly spiced, featuring a long finish of dried ginger, sandalwood and shortbread. Warmer and spicier than the Otima 10 (also recommended here), this has complex scents of roots and curry to balance its red fruit. The structure is firm and lean, the flavors energized by the alcohol, which drives it through a peppery finish. Pour it with a savory almond tart. The NV Otima 20 Year Old Tawny Port was tasted from a typical 500ml bottle, this bottling from 2014. Symington/Warre's also makes a ""regular"" 20-year-old tawny (to which I would give the nod), but they are intended to be very different styles. Rui Ribeiro at Symington Family Estates said to me: ""They are two different wines, coming from different blends..Different lot selections and different barrels. We have a specific aging lot for Otima which differs from the normal Warre tawny lot...The Warre’s 20YO tawny is a classic profile, showing a bit more nuttiness and wood notes, warmer palate perception (comparing with OT20). OTIMA 20 is probably the most elegant wine in the category, evident freshness on the nose, really elegant palate, great acidity and a completely clean and integrated finish."" That is a pretty good summary, for better or worse. This is indeed remarkably elegant and refreshing for a 20, dancing on the palate with light footsteps. That also means it is far better on the nose than the palate, though. It seems sunny and bright, but it doesn't show the concentration of flavor, tension on the finish or even the intense aromatics that the best 20s can. For many, it will be just what they want, something fresh and lively, but it is a bit underwhelming. That said, it certainly enlivens the palate and it is remarkably easy and fun to drink. Plus, after it was open for a few days (who says they don't change?), it began to show more of those classic, mature Tawny nuances, certainly more than were there initially. Take note, though: it is still Port, there is a lot of alcohol, even if it controls the perceptible spirit influence very well, and it will knock you on your butt if you drink too much. You'll want to do exactly that–it goes down easy and tastes great. "

This balanced aged tawny combines the fruitiness of this style with hints of spice from wood aging. The wine is ready to drink. The NV 10 Year Tawny Port, bottled February 23, 2021, is a blend of typical grapes. It was bottled with 100 grams of residual sugar and a bar-top cork. Nicely done, this Tawny has good concentration for the level, rich flavors, leaning to a darker profile, and a lively feel. The finish is lingering and filled with flavor. This is a nice performance for the level and the price. This will have no difficulty holding for a while, barring cork failures, but that's not really the point, and it doesn't need aging. "

In the old times, there were up to 8,000 hectares of Sumoll in Penedès, but a lot was uprooted and used for homemade wine. Thankfully, the variety is coming back, as it has a lot of potential.

If I had a minor quibble, there was a reductive hint around the edges. That should get better in time—or give it some air. Overall, this seems dry, serious and impressive for the level.

Full body, chewy yet polished tannins and great depth and complexity on the finish. I love the spice and blueberry character on the finish. Vibrant. A sexy style of Mouton. Try drinking this in 2022. Unquestionably one of the great wines in the vintage, the 2014 Mouton-Rothschild offers more flamboyance, depth, and texture than just about every other release out there. Crème de cassis, violets, lead pencil, and ample creamy oak notes all emerge from this incredibly sexy, concentrated 2014 that has a terrific mid-palate, sweet tannin, and a great, great finish. Not far off the incredible 2015, it can be enjoyed anytime over the coming 3-4 decades, although 3-5 years of bottle age should do it good. This delivers a large core of pure, unadorned cassis, accented by notes of anise, plum cake, mint and bitter plum
coulis. The core has serious heft, supported easily by a riveting iron spine that shows superb length through the
finish. A prodigious display of power and cut. Best from 2022 through 2040. The 2014 Mouton-Rothschild was closed at first when I tasted the wine in bottle with winemaker Philippe Dhalluin. But as it transpires, this First Growth is just toying with you. Initially quite understated, it responds to aeration like a young child peeking from around a corner and then running out, waving its hands. It suddenly hits you with gorgeous black cherries, bilberry, cedar and wilted rose petal. The palate is medium-bodied with a silky smooth entry. This is utterly seductive: a wine without a hair out of place. It is not as powerful or as complex as the 2015 Mouton-Rothschild, yet the precision and focus here is beguiling. It will require five to seven years to absorb the 100% new oak, then it will be an utterly delicious and to use a term employed at en primeur, ""cerebral"" First Growth that is destined to give two or three decades of pleasure.

The texture is tannic and fresh, with tannins starting to loosen but still in evidence. A luminous, radiant wine that will doubtless improve for another half-century. Drinking Window 2022 - 2082. The 1996 Lafite-Rothschild was remarkably deep in color considering that it is now 20 years in age. The bouquet is classic Pauillac with pencil shavings and sous-bois infusing the black fruit, masculine and a little aloof, yet focused and very well delineated. The palate is very well balanced with crisp blackberry and boysenberry fruit, spicier than I recollect, a crescendo of flavors so that it seems understated at first but fans out with a sense of confidence towards the finish. The beauty and balance of this are phenomenal. Seamless tannins and fruit. Full body yet so balanced and refined. Sweet tobacco and berries. Minerals and cedar. A beautiful wine. The depth is superb.

While fruit is at the center of the wine, it's savory and sophisticated rather than overtly sweet. The flavors touch on small berries - black currants, wild blueberries - and also hint at herbs (terragon, tobacco). This is a terrific vintage of Monte Bello: It feels healthy and sound, with tension and drive that will sustain it for decades in the cellar. One of the lowest-alcohol prestige Cabs on the market, Ridge's 2010 bottling is dry, softly tannic and light in body for a Cabernet Sauvignon. Yet it’s complex in flavor, offering tiers of blackberries, cherries, currants, herbs and spices. One of the lowest-alcohol prestige Cabs on the market, Ridge's 2010 bottling is dry, softly tannic and light in body for a Cabernet Sauvignon. Yet it’s complex in flavor, offering tiers of blackberries, cherries, currants, herbs and spices. This year’s version of what has become one of California’s iconic Cabernets is introduced in the nose by a fine combination of juicy young fruit, black olives and undisguised oaky sweetness, and its mannerly, multi-layered flavors follow suit. It is surprisingly supple for a wine of its age, and its gentle tannins firm without being intrusive, but a distracting, vaguely toothpicky pucker emerges at the end and warns against hasty drinking. Allow for at least five years of patience, and, given its pedigree, we would not be surprised if it continues to improve for a decade or more. "

There’s a velvety plushness in the mouth but linearity and focus thanks to a nicely textured grip of spicy savory tannins. Still in its youth, those primary fruits will gain complexity should this be given another few years in bottle.	 "

This is clearly a great terroir, and that comes through in this savory, broad, expansive, pure 2005 Proprietary Red from Sloan. Offering black raspberry and blackcurrant fruit, silky tannins, notes of forest floor and spice box, and loamy soil undertones, the wine is dense, full-bodied, opulent, and just entering its plateau of maturity, where it should keep for another 15-20 years. This was one of the stunners in the great line-up that I tasted of 10-year-old North Coast Cabernet Sauvignons. A bold, rich and ripe style, with complex black cherry, plum and wild berry fruit and a cedary graphite edge. Plush, concentrated and full-bodied, coating the palate, yet for all its size and chewiness this remains elegant, balanced and supported by firm tannins, showing a trace of heat on the finish. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Wonderful aromas of cedar, cigar box, currants, and dark berries. Nice notes of cappuccino, that open up to mint and flowers. Full bodied, with velvety tannins and fresh acidity. This is spicy and juicy, with generous fruit but held back. An exciting wine with a warm and juicy finish, and hints of tar. "

6375,Sine Qua Non The Naked Truth (chipped wax capulse),2005,Grenache,California,999,0,0.0,0,"The 2005 The Naked Truth (a blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah) displays a backside portrait of Manfred Krankl’s wife, Elaine. (Krankl does all the artwork for his labels.) Approximately 38% whole clusters/stems were used during fermentation, and the wine is aged in a combination of small barrels and larger demi-muids. Contrary to everything I have learned about Grenache, this offering spends 38 months in wood, yet it shows no evidence of oak, and it possesses remarkable vibrancy and freshness. It’s the kind of wine that makes a mockery of all “conventional” wisdom about oak and Grenache. Made totally from fruit grown in the 11 Confessions Vineyard in the Santa Rita Hills, it is about as profound a Grenache as one is likely to taste. Krankl looks everywhere for inspiration, and there is a large picture (and I mean large) of the great southern Rhone oenologist, Philippe Cambie, hanging in the winery. There may be a spiritual kinship to what Cambie’s magic is unleashing in the southern Rhone and what Krankl is doing in California. The dense ruby/plum/purple-colored Naked Truth reveals an extraordinary bouquet of sweet black raspberries, boysenberries, kirsch, licorice, pepper, and spice. Full-bodied with noteworthy concentration, freshness, texture, and length, it is a tour de force as well as a mind-boggling example of Grenache that is likely to turn heads, but how many wine lovers have the guts, courage, and are willing to put up with the tiny yields and challenging maturity curve of Grenache in California to pull off something like this? Not many. That’s why we don’t see more than a handful of wines such as this emanating from California. Offers an amazing purity of dark berry fruit, stylish and multifaceted, gushing with tiers of blackberry, wild berry and huckleberry, joined by spicy, grapey floral scents, with mineral, anise and fresh earth delivered on a beam. Yet for all its richness and depth of flavor, this is elegant. Drink now through 2018. 218 cases made. "

It fermented in stainless steel vats and matured in new and second use barriques for 22 months. This is a more delicate version of the Reserva with added freshness and a touch of red fruit. It has contained ripeness, elegance and balance with very tasty flavors and abundant fine-grained tannins. Meaty berry and dried plum aromas form an earthy nose that leads to a palate with good weight, concentration and acidity. Red plum and currant flavors benefit from integrated oak, while this reserva exhibits complexity via lightly herbal tomato notes on finish that otherwise pushes red-fruit character. Bright and lively, this red shows cherry, currant, fresh herb and orange peel flavors that have a tangy edge.

You can taste the soil. 70% merlot and 30% cabernet franc. One for long cellar aging. Old-vine character. Try after 2027. The flagship 2018 Vieux Château Certan is based on 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Franc and was brought up in (I suspect) roughly 50% new French oak. It tips the scale at 14.5% natural alcohol. This rock star of a Pomerol offers a kaleidoscopic array of red, black, and blue fruits, white truffle, spring flowers, tobacco, and crushed rock-like minerality on the nose. It has perfectly integrated oak, gorgeous concentration, building yet ultra-fine tannins, and not a hard edge to be found. I was able to follow this bottle for multiple days, and the large Cabernet Franc component became more and dominant, yet it never truly shut down and was always a joy to drink. Nevertheless, a good 7-8 years of bottle age are warranted, and it should evolve for 30-40 years in cold cellars. Deep and richly spiced notes of cinnamon and smoked butterscotch along with Cabernet Franc-dominant savoury fruits. Expands in all directions, showing precision and delicately brushed tannins. They carried out extremely careful selection from their 23 plots to ensure nothing at all raisined or over-concentrated made it into the wine, and certainly there is not a trace of the drought in the flavours here, just a seductively rich texture to the body of the wine.

Offering up notions of marzipan, citrus oil flowers, marmalade and spiced apricots, it flows onto the palate with full-bodied richness and depth that-s balanced by beautiful underlying freshness and clarity. While I would lean towards drinking bottles over the coming 2-3 years, these can absolutely age, and have upwards of 10-15+ years of longevity. Drink now-2017+. "

It is full-bodied and voluptuously textured, with notes of spice box, licorice and Provencal herbs, copious quantities of black currant and kirsch liqueur, stunning richness and a finish lasting close to a minute. This amazing effort confirms Krankl’s meticulous and nearly obsessively detailed work in both the vineyard and the winery. Anticipated maturity: now-2022. Truly intriguing, showing gorgeous aromas of spice and pepper, with a medley of berry scents. There's wonderful purity of flavor, with depth, density, focus and intensity.

6398,Pride Mountain Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (slightly torn label),2004,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,139,14.5,0.0,0,"Soft, rich and ripe, this is one of those Cabernets that feels dramatic in the mouth. Partly it's the fruit; complex in cherries, blackberries, mocha and rum and cola. Partly it's the oak and partly it's the fabulous balance of rich, sweet tannins and acidity. Put it all together, and it's irresistible. Though percentages from the two counties imply a blend, this is, in fact, a wine from one contiguous estate, straddling the border of Napa and Sonoma at the top of Spring Mountain. Most of the Cabernet is planted at the higher elevations of Pride's property, where the soils are particularly thin: gravel patchworks of volcanic rock, sandstone, clay and loam. They grow a structured Cabernet with distinctively pure black currant flavor, this '04 potent with the mineral tannin of those mountain soils. Check on it ten years from the vintage; it should continue to develop beyond that. "
6399,Pride Mountain Vineyards Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon,2011,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,195,14.4,0.0,0,"There are 1,374 cases of the 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve, which spent 22 months in 40% new French oak. It exhibits classic notes of new saddle leather, unsmoked cigar tobacco, red and blackcurrants, and loamy soil undertones in a full-bodied, intense, opulent, fleshy style. 85% came from Sonoma County and 15% from Napa County. This beauty is on a fast evolutionary track, so drink it during its first 7-8 years of life. Pride’s wines rarely fail to find an extra measure of richness, and, even in a vintage where richness was not always easy to achieve, this ripe and generously filled Cabernet lives up to winery expectations. It is impressively concentrated but stops well short of excess, and, if fairly sturdy in build, it flirts with an early suggestion of polish that makes it easy to believe in its future. "
6400,Chateau Lynch-Bages,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,149,13.5,4.3,9,"One of the finest Pauillacs of 2015, Lynch-Bages is rich, racy and voluptuous. A rush of dark red and purplish stone fruit, mint, new leather, spice and blood orange give the 2015 a very decidedly exotic character that is impossible to miss. Raspberry jam, mocha, new leather and expressive floral notes appear with time in the glass, rounding things out nicely. Even though the 2015 is quite forward and open at this stage, the wine has plenty of stuffing as well as the underlying structure to support many years of exceptional drinking. This is a stellar showing for Lynch-Bages. Brambly and attractive ripe blackberries and red-plum aromas with some floral accents, too. The palate has a very plush, polished and regal shape as tannins frame up a core of ripe black fruit. Succulent, impressive finish. Best from 2022. This has an ample core of plum, fig and blackberry compote flavors, underlined liberally with graphite and smoldering tobacco notes. Fleshy and focused, with ample grip through the juniper- and tar-accented finish. Well-built. Best from 2023 through 2038. This is powerful and deep with high but careful extraction and firm tannins. At this stage it feels so much younger and more closed than almost anything else I’ve tasted from this vintage in Pauillac. This is going for a firm, impressive impact and it manages it, but it lacks some generosity in the fruit character that it has in spades in 2016. 2% Petit Verdot. 75% new oak. One-third malolactic fermentation in vats, two-thirds in barrel. Always on my radar screen as wines to buy, I have always found this 5th Growth to be under-classified. While many in the wine trade place this wine in the 2nd Growth, I see it comfortably in the 3rd Growth arena, and indeed this wine has sometimes overtaken some of the highly vaunted 1st Growths. The 2015 Château Lynch Bages is handsome in so many ways. This wine exhibits beautifully attired black currants and a shading of oak. Enjoy its perfectly claret disposition with a juicy ribeye.

6402,Chateau Ausone,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,049",14,0.0,0,"The 2016 Ausone is a blend of 50% Cabernet Franc and 50% Merlot. Deep garnet-purple colored, it's quite closed at first glance, slowly unfurling to reveal the most incredible perfume of violets, chocolate-covered cherries, warm black plums, Black Forest cake and roasted nuts with suggestions of charcuterie, wood smoke and cedar chest. The medium to full-bodied palate offers a quiet intensity of flavors that grow in the mouth to unveil layer after layer of black and red berries intertwined with beautiful savory notions framed by firm yet velvety tannins, finishing with epic length and amazing energy. It practically tingles on the palate! The incredible succulent power in Ausone puts a different perspective on other wines, as it so often does. The epitome of perfumed finesse. The yield is up at 40hl/ha, high for these poor limestone soils, and the remarkable clarity of expression that runs right through the delicate but fleshy raspberry and smoke-tinged palate is helped by a pH of 3.5 (compared to 3.6 last year). In my book this counts as one of the truly exciting signatures of the vintage and that is only boosted by the limestone terroir. Stunning, with enormous persistency and a finish that just doesn't want to quit. Very exotic and fascinating with dark-berry, floral and violet aromas that follow though to a full body that is tight and polished with ultra-fine and driven tannins. They really are amazing. A wine with such strength and finesse at the same time. Confident and real Ausone. The 2016 Château Ausone is up with the crème de la crème of the vintage and isn’t far off the thrilling 2015, although it shows a more seamless, elegant character. Loads of spice, crushed violets, floral notes and subtle oak give way to a full-bodied beauty that has thrilling cassis and black raspberry fruits, polished tannin, perfect balance, and a great, great finish. This thrilling Ausone needs 4-6 years of bottle age but will keep for 30 years or more. "
6403,Lanson Le Black Label,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,49,12.5,4.2,90,"Lanson’s famed nonvintage cuvée is back on form, giving a ripe style dominated by Pinot Noir. It has weight and already a fine balance between the fruits and touches of toast from four years on the lees. This bottling of this Champagne is very ready to drink. 50% Pinot Noir, 35% Chardonnay and 15% Meunier from 100 villages in all, and including 30% reserves from 10 vintages back to 1995; a small proportion now being produced with malolactic. Black Label remains the confident barometer of Lanson, and Hervé Dantan’s first blend is a class act, a resounding statement of his talent in preserving the style and integrity of the house while meticulously polishing the edges. It’s a very important cuvée in the grand scheme of Champagne: one of the best and most consistent of the bargain set. Balanced and refined yet ripe, rich, and generous with sweet fruit, charm, and good length, this is a marvelous sparkler from an always reliable house. A fresh, balanced palate with green apples, pie crust and pears. Medium body, fine bubbles and a crisp, dry finish. Nice center palate. Four years on the lees. Drink now. Racy acidity is tightly meshed to flavors of ripe red and black currant, preserved lemon, chopped almond and honeycomb in this sleek Champagne, with a fine, chalky bead. Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier. Soft, chalky tannins structure this wine, sur-rounded by notes of pink grapefruit and russet apple. That balance of sweet fruit and tannins will meld with pate de foie. The flagship of the brand, the NV Champagne Le Black Label Brut release is based on the 2016 vintage with 40% reserve wine spanning 10 vintages. Some of the reserve wine is aged in cask, the remainder in stainless steel. The nose is expressive and fragrant with ripe red fruits, white strawberry, red roses, and brioche. The palate is juicy and round, with primary juicy Anjou pear, Mirabel plum, and honeycomb. A crowd pleaser, this is perfect as an aperitif and for parties. Best after 2022. "
6404,Chateau Palmer,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,384,14,4.4,18,"I am breathless with the dark-berry, lavender and burnt-orange aromas. Some salt. Just so formidable and deep. Stunningly sexy on the palate with a density and power, yet it leaves things so clean and bright. You want to drink it and enjoy it now, but it has the structure to last forever. Drink in 2022. Bottled relatively late in mid-September 2017, the 2015 Palmer is a blend of 44% Merlot and 50% Cabernet Sauvignon with a small portion of Petit Verdot. Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, it offers vibrant red currants, black cherries, wild blueberries, earth and mineral characteristics to begin, with slowly unfurling floral notes of violets and dried roses plus compelling baker’s chocolate and fragrant earth layers. Medium to full-bodied, generously fruited and possessing firm yet very, very fine-grained, mind-blowingly ripe tannins, the multifaceted palate features something of a skip in its step in terms of freshness, while it goes beguilingly earthy on the finish with some mineral hints. Very classy, elegant and sophisticated, this vintage is downright regal in its juxtaposition between poise and audaciousness. Think 2005 Palmer with a tick more fruit intensity, perfume and passion. One of the gems in Margaux is unquestionably the 2015 Palmer. Possessing more elegance and purity, as well as concentration, than the Alter Ego, it offers up a gorgeous bouquet of crème de cassis, caramelized cherries, charcoal, and graphite, with just a hint of spring flowers in the background. A final blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 44% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot that was brought up in 70% new oak, this full-bodied, ripe, incredibly polished 2015 is already hard to resist given its elegance and purity, yet should be at its best from 2023-2043. If you have more than one bottle, it's sensational today as well. This is dark and muscular in style, brimming with bramble, warm tar and paving stone notes that are matched by the deep layers of fig, blackberry and cassis fruit. A gorgeous bittersweet chocolate detail adds spine to the finish while violet and iron elements lurk in reserve. Another large wave of fruit and dark earth courses through the finish. Best from 2025 through 2045. It's very interesting to watch a 'super-second' risk scaling back the muscular attributes of its wine. The key, says director Thomas Duroux, was building the blend carefully and using the press wines to preserve the mid-palate (12% press in this wine, around the same as the 2015). It's less powerful and concentrated than the last few vintages, and yet the wine feels sculpted and sewn into place. The fine tannins are extremely clear and precise, and there's a purity of fruit expression that gives an overwhelming initial impression. The aromatics are really striking, offering an abundance of violet notes on the nose with huge finesse. It just gets better and better in the mouth,, and the tannins do that slow-build thing that is so disarming. This has clear ageing potential. Very low SO2 use for the past few years, in keeping with their biodynamic principles. Just one plot of Petit Verdot for the grand vin was hit by frost. Harvested 20-29 September. 11,000 cases of Palmer, representing 55% of the crop. "

Impressive '93, deep in color and full-bodied, boasting plenty of currant, black cherry, mint and toast character. Well crafted, showing depth for this vintage. After less than persuasive performances in two potentially great years, 1989 and 1990, Mouton-Rothschild appears to have settled down, producing fine efforts in recent vintages, culminating with the enormously promising, unquestionably profound 1995. The 1993 is a beautifully made wine which could be considered a sleeper of the vintage. The wine boasts a dark purple color, followed by a sweet, pain grillee, roasted nut, and cassis-scented bouquet that is just beginning to open. In the mouth, the wine may not possess the body and volume of a vintage such as 1990 or 1989, but there is more richness of fruit, a sweet, ripe, pureness to the wine, as well as medium body and outstanding balance. Mouton's great winemaking comes to the fore in this wine in the face of the difficult year of 1993. It's a surprisingly substantial Bordeaux for such a wet growing season, even now displaying strong blackberries and mint flavors. Full-bodied with tannins that are just coming around. "

The winery remains one of the benchmarks in the production of fortified sweet wines from the warm terroir of Rutherglen. Bullers entry-level Muscat blend sourced from inside and outside Rutherglen itself is a terrific value. It's perfumed yet full bodied and rich, with sweet notes of golden raisins and dried figs, as well as darker hints of dates and molasses. Bright and sweet, with aromatic spices and prune flavors, picking up a nice hint of dried cherry and strawberry as the finish lingers. Drink now. 5,000 cases made. "

This full-bodied Syrah reveals surprising freshness, finesse, and elegance despite its size. The wine is long, rich, and French in style. Rich and intense, with complex, focused mineral, berry, leather, tobacco, white pepper and cedary notes. Concentrated, with a sense of elegance and polish. "

Slightly exotic, with notions of kirsch, flower oil, smoked meats, licorice and graphite, it hits the palate with full-bodied richness and depth, loads of fruit and a blockbuster finish. More approachable than the 2010 extended barrel age Syrah, this beauty will still have 15+ years of longevity. Drink now-2024. "
6413,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon,1991,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,549,0,0.0,0,"The superb 1991 Cask 23 Proprietary Red Wine appears to be one of the truly outstanding examples of this expensive proprietary red wine. The wine's saturated dark purple color is followed by a huge, unevolved but sexy nose of toasty new oak, dense, black-cherry and jammy cassis fruit, and vague scents of underbrush and spice. Extremely rich and concentrated, it offers intriguing blackcurrant and coffee flavors, full body, remarkable harmony, and a finish that lasts for nearly a minute. Still young, unevolved, and less flattering at present than the more open knit 1990, it merits cellaring of 2-4 years. Smells complex and keeps introducing new flavor nuances, with an array of stewed plum, coffee, currant, black olive, roasted pine nut, red plum and red licorice.

6414,Sine Qua Non Dangerous Birds Grenache,2007,Grenache,California,969,0,0.0,0,"This is shipping next April. This is 100% from Eleven Confessions Vineyard.

This is so deep. I love it. Just a baby. A wine you really have to get to know. You have to feel it. Reminds me of the 1989 Rayas. The evolution will be amazing for decades to come. The 2007 Grenache Dangerous Birds, from the Eleven Confessions Vineyard, is a big, huge wine loaded with dark cherries, plums, licorice and smoke, all of which come together in a sensual, captivating wine of the highest level. This shows gorgeous inner perfume and fabulous overall balance. The silkiest of tannins frame the long finish. If forced to choose, I have a slight preference for the 2008 among the Estate Grenaches, but both wines are beautiful. Dangerous Birds is 88% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 2% Viognier. A portion of the Grenache (36% of the total blend) was fermented with whole clusters. The wine spent 34 months in oak and was bottled in August 2010. A rich, graceful mix of dark berry, charcoal, subtle cedar and spice notes joins shades of dried berry. This is medium- to full-bodied and elegantly styled, ending with a pleasing lift. "

Full-bodied with candied-lemon and cherry flavors. Creamy texture and a fresh finish. 73% pinot noir, 24% chardonnay and 3% pinot meunier.  Darker in color than many roses, this Champagne is also rich, with a tight texture that is balanced by zesty acidity and ripe red and citrus fruits. The wine is full-bodied, its concentration impressive. Drink now Made from 73% Pinot Noir, 24% Chardonnay, and the rest Meunier, the NV Champagne Royale Reserve Brut Rosé is based on the 2018 vintage and has 9 grams per liter dosage. The nose is ripe and fleshy, with strawberry, cherry, and crushed roses. It is rounded and fluffy in its mousse, though it is dry, with raspberry, almond, and a silky texture on the finish. This is certainly a crowd pleaser to drink now or over the next ten years as an aperitif, on its own, or at the end of the night. Firm acidity creates a mouthwatering frame for this finely knit rosé, while the crunchy texture carries notes of ripe white peach and cherry fruit, Acacia blossom and salted almond.

Hints of Marcona almond, graphite and spice linger on the minerally finish. Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Drink now Heading towards dryness, this pale-colored rosé Champagne is also rich. Its red-currant and crisp apple flavors are laced with citrus zest to give a wine that has fine balance. A pale-pink rosé, this has shades of raspberries, rosehips and rhubarb touching the earthy limestone scent of Champagne. It’s concentrated and lasting, with a clean quinine bitterness that will pair well with sashimi. Softly textured and ripe with red fruits and tight citrus, this Champagne is rich and full in the mouth. The tautness of the acidity contrasts with the richness of the fruit. Drink now. The NV Champagne Grand Brut Rosé pours a medium salmon hue and is equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir (8% of which is red wine). It is juicy with ripe raspberry, crushed flowers, and sweet citrus.

6424,Levy & McClellan Proprietary Red,2007,Other Red Blends,California,599,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon has closed down slightly since last year. Now in bottle, it exhibits an opaque purple color as well as a similar but more subdued bouquet of lead pencil shavings, burning embers, blueberry liqueur, creme de cassis and flowers. Powerful, rich and pure, its statuesque structure, lavish concentration and formidable tannin levels suggest 3-5 years of bottle age is warranted. This may turn out to be the finest Cabernet Sauvignon produced in the short history of the Levy and McClellan Diamond Mountain winery, although the 2008 has the potential to equal it.

The alcohol levels must be between 15.5% and 16%, but the elegance and sublime nature of this wine make it irresistible. Its dense ruby/purple color is followed by an extraordinary bouquet of framboise, black cherry liqueur intermixed with blacker fruits, licorice and a hint of flowers. Pure with terrific layers of fruit concentration (although it's remarkably light on its feet), silky tannins, well-integrated acidity and a stunning personality, this monumental Rayas is breathtaking. This beauty will undoubtedly be drinkable early on (although Emmanuel Reynaud considers that to be infanticide), and it is capable of lasting 25-30 years. The 2009 Châteauneuf Du Pape Reserve from Rayas is a beauty that shows the hallmark elegance and complexity of this estate paired with plenty of opulence and sweet fruit. Incredible Provençal notes of kirsch liqueur, herbes de Provence, framboise, and flowery incense all emerge from the glass, and it’s full-bodied, has sweet tannins, and an almost over-the-top personality that’s a joy to drink. It’s impossible to resist today yet will evolve for 25-30 years or more. This comes closest in my mind to the 2007 with its opulent, sexy style. "

A ripe style of rosé Champagne, this has red fruits in profusion balanced by a crisp, tight acidity. The wine’s texture supports the touch of toast and the mature acidity. The NV Champagne Le Rosé is also based on the 2016 vintage, with the addition of 30% reserve wine and 7% still red wine. It has a pale salmon hue, with delicate and fruity aromatics of strawberry, orchard fruit, and soft floral perfume. The palate has an elegant but energetic mousse, with a rounded mid-palate of ripe peach, raspberry, and a fresh, cleansing finish. These wines are approachable in style and cast a large net. Best after 2022. This clean, fresh rose presents ripe citrus flavors up front, hinting at tangerine and sweet clementine. Then it turns toward bitter-almond notes in the finish. Built for roast fish.

The IVDP (Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e Porto), Portugal's official body now places these wines in the category, ""Ruby Reserve Port.""

Full and ultra-fine tannins. It shows such great tannins and finesse. It is the essences of Pavie. Pure perfection in a glass and unquestionably one of the great vintages for this cuvée, the 2015 Pavie is a blend of 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc, and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon that was brought up in 80% new French oak. Sharing some similarities with the 2009, this tour de force sports a saturated purple color as well as a sweet bouquet of crème de cassis, crushed rocks, white truffle, and licorice. Its oak is perfectly integrated and balanced by this wine’s massive fruit and structure. Full-bodied, deep, and superbly concentrated, with building tannins, it’s a massive wine by any measure, but what sets it apart is that it still glides across the palate and retains an incredible sense of purity, balance, and elegance. It’s drinking well today due to the vintage’s opulence, yet won’t hit prime time for another 5-10 years and I suspect will keep for upward of 50 years. In 2015, the blend is 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, and the wine was matured 80% in new French oak. Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2015 Pavie is still sporting a bit of its oak to begin, giving way to a glorious nose of crushed black cherries, blackberries and mulberries plus hints of dried roses, stewed tea, unsmoked cigars and garrigue. The rich, concentrated, full-bodied palate delivers an incredible structure of very firm, very ripe tannins and a racy line of freshness cutting through the dense layers of perfumed black fruits and savory notions, finishing with epic length.

It reveals many of the same aromatic and flavor components found in the 2001 Midnight Oil and 2002 Syrah-dominated, unnamed offering. A black color is followed by a seamless effort loaded with blackberry, honey, and flower aromas, and an extraordinarily long, concentrated finish. As with all great wines, tasting notes/descriptors just can't do it justice. Among the recent SQN Syrahs, it is a strikingly elegant and powerful wine that has a decidedly French flair to it. "

It has plenty of fruit and depth, but not quite the complexity or layered personality of the very best wines in the Rhys lineup. Today it comes across as a bit one-dimensional, with pure power reigning over all else. This is one of the riper wines in the range and it displays its wood treatment a bit more prominently as well with cassis, plum, spice and dried rose petal scents. There is good volume and a seductive mid-palate as there is good concentration and sap to the delicious yet entirely serious finish that is supported by firm but not aggressive tannins. This is really very good, if a bit of an outlier stylistically. "

The palate is medium-bodied with a slightly grainy texture, lovely black fruit here laced with Earl Grey, spice and sage, quite intense and fanning out gloriously towards the long finish. This seems to have gained precision after bottling and I did warn that it may merit a higher score. This is a deeply impressive L'Evangile that might challenge Lafite-Rothschild in the long term. Chapeau! The blackberry, mushroom and oyster-shell character really comes out. Full body and flavors of dark chocolate, walnuts and concentrated berries. Structured. Bitter-chocolate aftertaste. Try drinking in 2022. Big, bold and ripe, this is a rich wine with its 82% Merlot. It is jammy while keeping its tannins and structure. Ripe and full in the mouth, the wine is firm enough to age for a long time. It is going to be generous, full and ripe. Drink from 2025. This alluring red features velvety tannins carrying notes of crushed plum, warm blackberry preserves and dark licorice, gaining muscle through the charcoal-scored finish. There's a deep tug of warm earth throughout, and this needs a little time to stretch out. Best from 2020 through 2030. A blend of 82% Merlot and 18% Cabernet Franc from the team at Rothschild, the 2014 L’Evangile is a ripe, sexy effort that gives up lots of cassis and black raspberry fruits, toasty oak, Asian spices, and chocolate. A wine that gains depth and richness with time in the glass, it offers medium to full-bodied richness, a silky, expressive style, and sweet tannin, all making for a seductive, impossible to resist Pomerol. This beauty hit 14% natural alcohol, so it’s no lightweight, yet it lacks the depth and density of the 2015. Drink this impressive 2014 anytime over the coming 15-20 years. Slightly trimmer and less opulent in style with all the estate's Cabernet Franc in the blend (18%). Gently aromatic with attractive fruit. Long and silky on the palate. Touch of alcohol on the finish but balanced by the freshness of the tannins. "

Full-bodied, yet reserved and tight with very silky tannins that are energized and minerally. Takes off at the end. The freshness lifts it. Try after 2024. This has all the power that St-Emilion can deliver, but deals it out slowly with precision, gorgeous balance and a clean lift. It has great concentration, purity and depth, without sacrificing the integrity of the juicy blueberry and cassis fruits. It really is a great example of what the limestone plateau can do. The 2015 delivers a slightly more voluptuous edge to the fruits, whereas this vintage emphasises fresh mint leaf, salinity and grip. A wonderful wine, utterly delicious. The 2016 Château Canon is another beautiful wine from this estate, made in a more streamlined, elegant style compared to the richer, sexier 2015. Checking in as a blend of 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc all from a magical terroir situated on the upper plateau just outside of the village of Saint-Emilion, it saw a small percentage of the blend go through malolactic fermentation in barrel, and the wine spent 18 months in 70% new French oak, with the balance in once-used. Gorgeous notes of blueberries, cassis, spring flowers, white truffle, and crushed rock nuances all come soaring from the glass and it has notable intensity as well as complexity. Medium to full-bodied, with vibrant acidity, ultra-fine tannins, and a straight, silky texture, I don’t think it matches the 2015 on concentration, but it’s perfectly balanced and has a texture to die for. It needs a good 4-5 years of bottle age (or more) and it’s going to be long-lived. Tasted three times. Very generously appointed with ripe, black cherry fruit and decked
out with a broad sweep of sweet spice in both scent and taste
and showing lovely continuity and fine concentration, Château
Canon is a serious, far-reaching St.-Emilion wine that compels
contemplation and seems to reveal a little more interest with
each sniff and sip. It is not an immense wine, but it is one of
great strength and real beauty that is guaranteed to pay even
greater dividends when laid away and allowed to develop for six
to ten years. "
6437,Berlucchi '61 Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,Italy,43,12.5,4.0,10,"Bright and savory, this refreshing, polished sparkler boasts alluring aromas of juicy raspberry, wild cherry, baking spice and a whiff of bread crust. The inviting aromas follow over to the vibrant palate along with a continuous refined perlage. A tangy candied nectarine note closes the finish. Delicate red forest fruit, pastry and lemon curd nose. Notes of red blossom and toast on the palate. A good effort, finishing lengthily. Blend : 60% Pinot Nero, 40% Chardonnay Enticing aromas and flavors of ripe strawberry and raspberry fruit are set on the fine, lively bead in this clean-cut, mouthwatering rosé, with a chalky underpinning. Lightly spiced on the lingering finish. Pale pink; crisp, citrus nose; juicy and tangy with lively acidity and snappy style; good depth, balanced and finesse. A grapefruit-colored rosé with sliced apples, raspberries, blood orange and some brioche on the nose. It’s medium-bodied with silky, soft bubbles and bright acidity. Crisp and fresh with a savory finish. Dry feel. Drink now. The NV Franciacorta '61 Brut Rosé (disgorged in 2017) represents a nicely balanced blend of 60% Pinot Nero and 40% Chardonnay aged in the bottle on the lees for 24 months. Some 140,000 bottles were produced. This is a delicate but festive wine that shows a steady succession of small berry, lilac and floral aromas. There's a refreshing kick of acidity on the close. "

6439,Sandeman 30 Year Old,Tawny,Port,Portugal,114,20,4.6,59,"This is a beautifully concentrated wine. Rich and dense, it offers dried fruits, spice and intensity. The wine’s spirit edge acts as a lift, bringing out acidity, honey, walnuts and a complex perfumed aftertaste. Drink now Though the final blend comprises 25- to 40-year-old wines, with its reddish-orange topaz hue, freshness and fruit intensity, this is a relatively youthful-seeming 30-year-old. Caramelized oranges, dried apricot and fig take center stage, with hints of café crème and toasted hazelnuts. Slinky, its gentle barley-sugar sweetness is cut with elegant acidity, making for a clean, controlled finish; The NV 30 Years Old Tawny Porto is a typical Douro blend. It was bottled in August 2022 with a Vinolok stopper and 121 grams per liter of residual sugar. Complex and darker in flavors, yet still lively and fresh, this elegant 30 Year first shows its age when it coats the palate and proves how concentrated it is. It is remarkably delicious too, with the dark chocolate and caramel-laced fruit slammed into the palate. The melted chocolate of the 20 Year leans more to dark chocolate here, but it never goes too far in the direction of bitter. If it often seems mature, it never seems old. It's always enlivening, and the structure might be even better that the fine flavor profile. It acquires a tightly wound feel and some power on the juicy, mouthwatering finish. This is a fine success. Best after 2022. Candied cherries and light caramel with honey and brown sugar on the nose. Dense and rich with plenty of mahogany and nutty undertones to the very sweet palate. Shows lots of age. Sort of dusty and aged, like old furniture in England. Drink now. Pretty, with bergamot, date, fig and caramelized peach flavors
gliding through, framed by a caramel note that lingers on the
polished finish. This gains intensity as it opens in the glass. Lovely.
Drink now. This wine had W&S associate editor David Paradela imagining himself on a velvet couch in an old library. Maybe it has the comforting complexity of being surrounded by all the ideas in old books. At your dinner table, it may bring to mind dried cherries and apricots, along with the warmth of toasted almond in their tawny skins. "
6440,Chateau Mouton Rothschild (US label),1993,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,519,0,0.0,0,"Mouton comes through again. Impressive '93, deep in color and full-bodied, boasting plenty of currant, black cherry, mint and toast character. Well crafted, showing depth for this vintage. Give the tannins some time to mellow. After less than persuasive performances in two potentially great years, 1989 and 1990, Mouton-Rothschild appears to have settled down, producing fine efforts in recent vintages, culminating with the enormously promising, unquestionably profound 1995. The 1993 is a beautifully made wine which could be considered a sleeper of the vintage. The wine boasts a dark purple color, followed by a sweet, pain grillee, roasted nut, and cassis-scented bouquet that is just beginning to open. In the mouth, the wine may not possess the body and volume of a vintage such as 1990 or 1989, but there is more richness of fruit, a sweet, ripe, pureness to the wine, as well as medium body and outstanding balance. This moderately tannic, well-focused, surprisingly rich 1993 is capable of 15-20 years of evolution. Mouton's great winemaking comes to the fore in this wine in the face of the difficult year of 1993. It's a surprisingly substantial Bordeaux for such a wet growing season, even now displaying strong blackberries and mint flavors. Full-bodied with tannins that are just coming around. "
6441,Delamotte Blanc de,Blancs,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,89,12,4.2,59,"Based on the Côte des Blancs, the Champagne home of Chardonnay, it’s logical that this producer should make a fine Blanc de Blancs. This wine has all the attributes, with crisp apple and a mineral texture that is tightly prominent. This is a fine wine, just hinting at toastiness. Drink now. Vineyard Brands. A graceful blanc de blancs, with racy, lemony acidity acting as a bright spine, backing flavors of poached apricot, biscuit, oyster shell and fresh thyme on a plushly creamy mousse. Drink now. Subtle but pretty yeast and dried floral nuances are present on the cool green apple and petrol aromas. The utterly delicious, intense and attractively textured middle weight flavors are supported by a firm but fine mousse before culminating in a crisp, mildly austere and sneaky long finish that drinks drier than the stated dosage would suggest. This is a wine that could easily be enjoyed now or held for another 3 to 5 years as I suspect that the complexity will markedly improve with a few years of bottle age. Lovely. Baked-apple, light cream and vanilla aromas with some citrus, too. Full-bodied with candied-citrus and ginger character. Croissant undertones on the finish. Biscuit-like note, too. Drink or hold. Moving into the NV Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut, this release is from the 2016 base vintage with 7 grams per liter of dosage. The nose is very pretty and pure and starts to show the character emblematic of the house style. The aromas have classic charm, with ripe green pear, brioche, white flowers, and crushed stone, while the palate offers more tension and mineral drive, with bright green apple, melon, and citrus pith. With its wonderful concentration and a refreshing nature, this textbook Blanc de Blancs offers a lot of pleasure. Best after 2022. "

It's full and voluptuous in the mouth, with rich buttery brioche characters. As the palate evolves, the wine's freshness comes through, sweeping in with lemon and grapefruit and underpinning that cherry and almond frangipane richness with tense power. A light hint of Battenberg cake emerges on the finish. With 11ha in the Bouzy terroir, well known for exceptional Pinot Noir, brothers Antoine and Quentin actually have a high proportion of Chardonnay vines for this area, and this wine unusually is majority Chardonnay (65%), with the remaining Pinot Noir, 5% of which is red wine. They put a lot of focus into the health of their soils, and they farm organically. "

6447,M. Chapoutier Ermitage Le Pavillon,2016,Syrah/Shiraz,France,789,14.5,0.0,0,"Aged entirely in barriques (25% new), the 2016 Ermitage le Pavillon shows only a hint of warm pencil shavings on the nose, beautifully setting up notes of fresh blackcurrants. Full-bodied, concentrated and plush across the mid-palate, it turns rich and velvety on the nearly endless finish, marked by savory notes of beef, licorice and espresso. If you wish to catch a glimpse of this wine's greatness, it would be no crime to open a bottle upon release, as I suspect it will close down for a number of years soon afterward. More structured and tannic, yet sensationally concentrated, the 2016 Ermitage Le Pavillon comes all from the broken granite soils of the Bessards lieu-dit and was brought up in just 30% new French oak. It gives up awesome notes of blue fruits, crushed rocks, graphite, and lit gunpowder. Rich, full-bodied, and incredibly massive and opulent on the palate, yet with serious amounts of tannins, extract, and depth, it's a tour de force and one of the gems in the vintage as well as a monumental Hermitage. Hide bottles for 5-7 years, count yourself lucky, and enjoy over the following 4-5 decades. Matured in 28% new oak for 20 months. Aromas of soy, plum sauce, blackberry and blackcurrant. Exceptional smoothness of tannin, very seductive, almost drinkable now. There's lovely purity and acidity running through to a long finish. Exceptionally pretty and pure, but powerful. A black stallion of a wine. Drinking Window 2022 - 2040 Smoldering black tea, bay leaf and tobacco hints swirl around a core of gently mulled black cherry and blackberry
fruit flavors, ending with singed mesquite and sassafras notes. Sneakily long. This will take time to unwind in the
cellar. Best from 2021 through 2040. Luminous blackberry and raspberry flavors are edged by shards of stone and smoke in this deeply fruity but intensely mineral Syrah. It’s fresher and brighter in fruit than the producer’s other 2016 Hermitage, full bodied but taut and bracing in feel. Rigid tannins should meld as the wine opens and gains complexity. Best enjoyed from 2022, it should reward cellaring well through 2040. "

The 1996 is long, with a deep mid-palate. It also reveals tannin in the finish. This wine is remarkable. It is muscular, concentrated, and classic. Bottled in late June, 1998, it exhibits a saturated ruby/purple color, as well as a knock-out nose of minerals, licorice, cassis, and an unmistakable lead pencil smell that I often associate with top vintages of Lafite-Rothschild. It is sweet and full-bodied, yet unbelievably rich with no sense of heaviness or flabbiness. The wine possesses high tannin, but it is extremely ripe, and the sweetness of the black currant, spice-tinged Cabernet Sauvignon fruit is pronounced. This profound, backward Ducru-Beaucaillou is a must purchase. It will be fascinating for readers who own the 1996 to follow the evolution of this exceptional vintage. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2035. The 1996 Ducru-Beaucaillou is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot harvested from the 23rd of September to the 8th of October. Medium brick colored, it delivers mature notes of sweaty leather, camphor, tobacco and dried mulberries with a core of kirsch, charcuterie and dried cranberries plus a waft of sandalwood. Medium-bodied, the palate has fantastic freshness with a light chewiness to the texture and loads of herbs spark red and black fruits, finishing earthy. Intense aromas of cedar, vanilla, leather and blackberry. Full-bodied, with coffee, vanilla, ripe fruit and a medium finish. Just about ready.

Showing good concentration without weight, this is a vibrant, well-tailored example. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.  Generous and expressive, the latest rendition of Vilmart's NV Brut Premier Cru Cuvée Rubis is showing very well, bursting with aromas of red berries, plums, blood orange and dried flowers. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, with a sapid core of fruit, a pillowy mousse and a lively, delicately phenolic finish, it's already drinking well. This is based on the 2017 vintage, with reserve wines from the 2016 and 2015 vintages, and it was disgorged with nine grams per liter dosage. The NV Cuvée Rubis is vibrant pink, with aromas of wildflowers, wild raspberry, and juicy fruit. The palate is juicy and round, with blood orange, and perfect for relatively near-term drinking over the next 6-8 years. "

The NV Sibarita Oloroso VORS is produced with Palomino grapes, balanced with 2% of Pedro Ximenez, something quite common to polish the edges of very old wines, in a solera created in 1792. It has a dark mahogany color, and the nose shows some toffee notes intermixed with roasted coffee, tar, ash and incense. The palate shows good depth, strong acidity, well compensated by the sweetness, and a slightly bitter finish. It stands apart from other Olorosos, with a unique range of aromas and flavors. 1,500 bottles are filled each year. Drink 2013-2020. Sibarita is dry—extremely dry—but also exquisitely sophisticated in flavor: smoky, earthy and sweetly complex. Its saline acidity and steely mineral structure lend a firm backbone. A classic Oloroso, this comes from a solera established in 1792; the current bottling represents wines that are at least 30 years old. This has good range, with walnut and Brazil nut notes weaving around dried orange, date, clove, black tea and salted caramel accents.

The palate has a super powerful and long, linear core with plenty of fruit flesh strapped in tight for a long and thrilling ride into the finish. A blend of 86 per cent cabernet and 14 per cent merlot. Try from 2024. This is so vivid as it brims with pastis-soaked plum, blackberry, black currant and blueberry paste flavors, all carried by a perfectly integrated brambly spine. Tar and ganache notes give the finish an extra kick while everything stays within the mouthwatering roasted apple wood frame. Both regal and rambunctious, this is St.-Julien to a T. Best from 2025 through 2040. A brilliant young wine, the 2016 Léoville Barton unwinds in the glass with aromas of cassis, dark berries and cigar box mingled with subtle hints of loamy soil. Medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, it's seamless and exquisitely balanced, with beautifully refined tannins, bright acids and a long, penetrating finish. Its structural refinement is such that it's far from forbidding to open right now, yet patience will be richly rewarded. This vintage is dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, making it comparable to some top Pauillacs. The Barton family has owned these vineyards for centuries and always makes very fine claret, but this is exceptional. Opulent and vibrant nose, crammed with blackcurrant. Depth, grip and concentration, but balanced and stylish too, with notable freshness. For the long haul. Drinking Window 2024 - 2045 Effusively fruity and fresh on the nose and very well-concentrated if showing a bit of youthful tightness on the palate, this wine starts out with a real sense of promise only partially kept in its slightly taut, not-fully-developed flavors. It in some ways recalls the reticence of the wine from its slightly more northerly-sited neighbor, Château Leoville-Poyferré, but it is slightly deeper with more fruit consequence and is the one we would more readily choose to age.

Great silky texture despite all its power. Sadly, there are only 7,700 bottles of the 1998 Cote Rotie La Landonne. This spectacular offering boasts a deep purple color in addition to a dense nose that the French would call a confiture of black fruits, particularly plums, blackberries, and black currants. Superb aromatics jump from the glass of this young, unevolved 1998. On the palate, it is deep and dense, with a multi-layered texture, and terrific purity and concentration.

6471,Chateau Latour (1.5 Liter Magnum),1994,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,399",0,0.0,0,"This is an interesting as well as great vintage for Latour. As indicated in my barrel tasting report, Latour's 1994 possesses an atypically high percentage of Merlot (27%) in the final blend. Because of this, the wine appears to have a sweeter, more fleshy texture than is typical for a young Latour, but do not make the mistake of thinking this will be a commercially-styled, easy to drink wine. It exhibits an opaque dark ruby/purple color, and a backward, intense textbook nose of walnut and cassis scents complemented by smoky pain grille notes that build in the glass. This full-bodied, powerful, layered Latour reveals high tannin, but no bitterness or astringency. The superb purity, fabulous precision, and remarkable length should ensure 35-40 years of longevity. Readers will find more fat, flesh, and glycerin than usual for a young Latour (save for such great vintages as 1982 and 1990), but don't be deceived, this wine requires 8-10 years of cellaring. Anticipated maturity: 2005-2035. Classic Cabernet style. Intense aromas of plums and cherries, with hints of new wood. Full-bodied, with juicy and ripe tannins and a long finish.

It's beautifully textured and has a solid mid-palate, good density, and a clean, crisp finish, all making for a high-quality Champagne to enjoy over the coming 5-7 years. This Champagne is rich while well balanced. Good bottle age gives spice and maturity to the apple and pear flavors. A solid structure and a zesty texture add extra dimension. A clean Champagne, green-gold in color with the flavor of peaches just coming into ripeness, this wine’s cool mineral savor brings to mind grapes sautéed in butter, as in sole Véronique, with which this wine would partner well.

Rich and smooth, backed by firm, refined tannins. Shows excellent balance and length. Best from 2021 through 2038. Carpineto farms Sangiovese and other grapes in the most important wine appellations of Tuscany, including Chianti Classico, Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. This is the first time I am seeing a Gran Selezione from this far-reaching estate. The 2015 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione shows dark fruit, plum, prune and soft touches of potting soil. The wine delivers thick lines and dense contours that are even more evident in this hot and sunny vintage. This would be a nice Sangiovese to pair with a Tuscan peposo—meat stewed in tomato and red wine. "

Until the 2007 is in bottle, the 2005 is clearly the greatest wine made at this estate since the 1995. Made from 100% Grenache, it boasts an unusually (for Rayas) dark ruby/purple-tinged color as well as an exceptionally sweet bouquet of black cherry jam, truffles, incense, licorice, and raspberries. Full-bodied with a stunningly rich, concentrated mouthfeel, an explosive mid-palate, and a finish that lasts more than a minute, it is a wine of superb power and intensity admirably displaying the terroir’s hallmark delicacy and ethereal nature. This utterly profound Chateauneuf du Pape should drink beautifully for 25+ years. "
6479,Chateau Bellevue Mondotte,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,199,14.5,0.0,0,"This almost pure merlot shows a solid core of dark berries and a hint of dark chocolate. Full-bodied, ripe and round with compact tannins. Extremely long and intentional. Gorgeous finish. Drink after 2025. A very polished and frankly ripe style, with caressing cassis and creamed raspberry notes cruising through, infused with anise and warm licorice flavors that drape across the finish. Despite the obvious style, this has density without coming off as heavy, with a very long finish that lets the fruit sing. Will have fans for sure. Best from 2021 through 2035. The six-acre vineyard sits on the plateau of Saint-Émilion. Juicy acidity and fresh black fruits give this wine an immediately attractive character. It is enhanced by perfumed tannins: not dry, almost sweet and certainly rich. Drink this wine from 2024. "

A far more challenging vintage to get everything right, and especially in St.-Emilion, where many disappointments have been produced, this is one of the wines of the vintage and (along with Pavie) among the finest wines from the Right Bank. It possesses a deep purple color as well as a gorgeous nose of creme de cassis, blackberries, wet stones, and wonderfully perfumed floral notes. When the wine hits the palate, it exhibits impressive purity, medium to full body, a multi-layered texture, and extraordinary precision and intensity with a finish just short of 50 seconds. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2035. Beautiful blackberry and decadent aromas of meat and earth. Full-bodied, with velvety tannins and a rich, long finish. Should develop really nicely in the bottle.

6488,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon,2014,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,329,14.5,4.5,32,"The 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon Cask 23 is a smoking effort from this team. Revealing a deep purple color and stunning notes of blackcurrants and black raspberries like fruit, it offers loads of spice, cedar and dried flower nuances, full-bodied richness, a ripe, full-bodied, majestic texture, beautiful tannin quality, and a great finish. This sensational 2014 has a rare mix of power and elegance and will keep for 20-25 years. Winemaker Marcus Notaro blends this wine from two adjacent estate-owned vineyards farmed by Kirk Grace. Fay, with its alluvial soils, provides 44 percent of the blend in 2014; the balance comes from S.L.V., where the vines rise higher up the eastern bench of Stag’s Leap, rooted in the crush of volcanic rock that has washed down off the palisades. They combine in a cabernet with cool richness, layering fruit notes of chocolate and wild mushrooms with a rush of satiny fruit tannins. There are no barriers to obscure the wine’s youthful integration or its complexity, still incipient, but there in the breath for minutes, compellingly fresh and satiating in its savor. Glorious aromas of blacberries and blackcurrants follow through to a full body, ultra-fine tannins and an alluring finish. It shows such polish and verve. Try it in 2020, but it's already a show to taste. Shows the pedigree. Deftly balanced, creamy and smooth-textured, with an elegant array of red and dark berry, anise, cedar and mocha flavors, ending with fine-grained tannins and a splash of mocha. Drink now through 2032. "

Layered, sweet and sensual, the 2009 is laced with attractive scents of mocha, cloves and violets, all of which add complexity to the dark fruit. The 2009 needs a few years to soften, but ultimately it stands out for its textured personality and terrific balance. This undeniably appealing wine is likely to be at its best over the next 10-15 years, give or take. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2029. "

Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier. Lovely floral and red cherry nose, carrying through to oranges on the mid-palate with notes of dark chocolate and cream. Long, rich finish. The latest release of Perrier-Jouët's NV Brut Blason Rosé is generous and charming, delivering notes of ripe peach, strawberries and pears complemented by hints of fresh bread. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, its sweet core of fruit is girdled by ripe acids. This is an immediate, demonstrative rosé that will appeal to a broad audience and drink well young. "
6492,Chateau de Beaucastel Chateauneuf-du-Pape (1.5 Liter Magnum),1989,Rhone Red Blends,France,649,13.6,0.0,0,"This is a floral and elegantly complex edition of this wine with dried meat and leather, iron and graphite, tobacco and dry spices. More elegant palate than the 1990, it has a very fine stream of red fruit and spiced cherries and a central, linear focus. The flavors hold so very long, deeply concentrated and focused. The fruit livens up at the finish and opens very impressively. Drink now. Perhaps the greatest Beaucastel ever produced. Has the class and structure of a great vintage of Mouton-Rothschild. Deep, inky in color, with intense herb, plum, game and spice aromas, this full-bodied wine has an explosion of fruit and an iron backbone. The 1989 is inkier/purple in color than the 1990, with an extraordinarily sweet, rich personality offering up notes of smoke, melted licorice, black cherries, Asian spices, and cassis. Full-bodied and concentrated, it is one of the most powerful as well as highly extracted Beaucastels I have ever tasted "
6493,Osborne Pedro Ximenez,1827,Sherry,Spain,27,17,4.0,52,"The House of Osborne was founded in 1772 by Thomas Osborne and has been continuously family owned and operated ever since. The non-vintage Pedro Ximinez 1827 is amber/brown in color with sweet candied aromas. Viscous in texture, it offers sweet flavors of fig, apricot, and raisins. So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It’s rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious. There is a tense saltiness to balance the viscous texture of this PX. Its intense cappuccino and caramel flavors gain more presence with air. Pour it with crema catalana. "

Chardonnay from three of the Côte des Blancs villages gives a strongly mineral character that has benefited from five years aging to produce a tight, taut wine that is just reaching maturity. Drink now. Crushed white cherry and slivered almond notes are framed by clean-cut acidity in this balanced, creamy Champagne, with accents of orchard blossom and ground ginger on the finish. Drink now through 2019. "

Extremely fresh on the palate, offering nervy redcurrant and raspberry flavors and a strong spicy underpinning. A zesty note of blood orange comes up with air and adds a tangy edge to the long, precise, floral-accented finish.

6500,Glaetzer Anaperenna Shiraz/Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Other Red Blends,Australia,83,15,0.0,0,"I love what Glaetzer's inclusion of Cabernet brings to the 2017 Anaperenna Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon, giving it additional fragrance and length. Lifted aromas of mint, raspberries and dark chocolate mark the nose, while the full-bodied palate is rich and velvety but never heavy, framed by supple tannins that turn silky on the long, long finish. Showing great focus, energy and intensity, expect it to still be going strong in a decade. My repetitious tasting note reads ‘very sexy, very flashy, demonstrative and juicy, spice and leather, very sexy, layered, delicious, forward’. With 18% Cabernet it gets a guest pass in this line-up. I like the anchoring effect of the cabernet in this blend, which really adds a central spine to the palate and brings length to the wine. Plenty of ripe dark fruit – cassis and blackberries – that really hold the finish long. Opens with a mouthful of perfectly ripe, thick wild blackberry and kirsch flavors, with details of white pepper, bay laurel and orange zest, plump and smooth. Offers thick but seamless tannins, revealing a touch of malt on the finish. Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now through 2034. "

On the palate the wine is powerful, framed by firm but fine tannins and underpinned by a tensile line of acidity. It's the most structured and powerful of the Vérité wines, sapid and serious. Aromas of lead pencil, graphite and hot slate. Blackcurrants, too. Full-bodied, very tight and tannic. Linear and driven on the finish. Very fresh and energized. Racy and focused. Primarily cabernet sauvignon. Needs three to four years to come around completely. Try in 2021. "

With fruit from Castiglione Falletto, it also has what tastes like riper, darker and more fleshed-out fruit flavors. This wine delivers lots of power (with 15% alcohol), stems, structure and large-scale tannins, as expected. It's a lot to take in. Best After 2024 A medium-bodied Barolo with pretty easygoing wild-strawberry and fine-tannin style. Compact and tight, this is tempting even now, but give it another year. Light orange red color in the glass. Unusual but super expressive nose, really fragrant cherry notes, delicately perfumed, but so distinct - like potpourri, dried flowers with touches of cola and caramel. Precise and driven on the palate, certainly with a distinct coffee, cherry stone flavor. Good acidity, juicy, mouthwatering and incredibly fresh - freshly picked strawberries and cherries - but it's the savory touch with a real mineral stone cleanliness that grips the tongue and takes hold that is so captivating. Lovely depth on the mid palate, quite a driven style but very linear, direct and taught at the moment. More savory than overtly fruity. Super elegant. "
6505,Rhys Vineyards Horseshoe Vineyard Pinot Noir,2009,Pinot Noir,California,109,13.3,0.0,0,"The 2009 Pinot Noir Horseshoe Vineyard is the most virile wine in this lineup. Black cherries, mint, iron and crushed rocks come together in this dramatic, generous Pinot. The fleshiness of the fruit nearly covers the tannins, but they are lurking beneath the wine’s considerable fleshiness. Menthol, pine and a host of other dark, balsamic notes wrap around the insistent, powerful finish. Exhibits enticing hot brick and earthy traits, with a dense core of beefy dried berry, black tea, white pepper and cedar, holding its focus and ending long and persistent. Should reward cellaring. "

Just a baby—this needs time! Dark and chocolatey with a lot of richness, but also a cool herbal freshness this is a very impressive Medoc wine that's already delicious to drink. Very long, surprisingly supple finish for this château. A perfect wine. Drink or hold. This seems to come full circle, with a blazing iron note and mouthwatering acidity up front leading to intense, vibrant cassis, blackberry and cherry skin flavors that course along, followed by the same vivacious minerality that started things off. The tobacco, ganache and espresso notes seem almost superfluous right now, but they'll join the fray in due time. The question is, can you wait long enough? "

It opens very reluctantly, requiring considerable air with vigorous swirling and doggedly demands a few hours before it offers glimpses at this slumbering giant of a wine. As it eventually unfurls, it slowly morphs into a powerful, fantastically pure nose of preserved plums, blackberry preserves and blueberry compote, followed by nuances of molten licorice, dark chocolate, black truffles, iron ore and, still later, floral notions of lilacs and rose oil come through. The full-bodied palate is taut, muscular and oh-so-tightly wound at this stage, revealing peeks at many, many layers of perfectly ripe black and blue fruits, exotic spices and earthy notions for which words simply fail. Clear flesh to the plump damson fruits, alongside grilled caramel, graphite, cassis bud and cocoa bean. The tannins are plentiful, but they are plush, ripe and flexible, and as such are full of Pomerol signature. As it opens through the palate, you realise just how much grip and persistency there is, and the more serious side asserts itself, with bitter cocoa shavings and fresh acidities. A more approachable Petrus at this early stage than in many years, but the kick is there and this is getting set for the long term. 50% new oak. Bottled in July after two months in vat following end of barrel ageing. Drinking Window 2026 - 2048 Plush and inviting, with steeped red and black currant and fig flavors that meld nicely with fruitcake, Christmas pudding and anise notes through the finish. Subtle dark earth hint at the end keeps it grounded. The vintage's slightly austere edge is here, but is minimized by the fruit, helping this stand apart from the pack. Best from 2023 through 2034. "

Medium to full-bodied, the palate has bags of elegance and grace with layers of earthy and savory nuances and a good core of black fruit preserves, flanked by firm, fine-grained tannins, finishing with a quiet intensity.

Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. This is a big, hard, tannic wine. It’s so buttoned up, the question is whether it will age. Most of the signs say yes.

There is plenty of beauty and richness in the glass, but not quite the sheer visceral thrill of the very best Costa Russis. Although I wouldn't open any of the 2009 single-vineyard wines in the near-term, the Costa Russi is the most expressive of the three. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2029. Wonderful aromas of crushed cherries, peaches, and ripe strawberries follow through to a full body, with chewy tannins and a mineral and floral aftertaste.

The medium to full-bodied palate is chock-full of muscular black fruits, delivering compelling vivacity and tension, framed by velvety tannin's and finishing epically long and perfumed. The intense, bright, energetic fruit on this 2018 has been impeccably preserved. Stunning! Beautiful all the way, the deep purple hued 2018 Château Clos Fourtet comes from one of the prized terroirs on the upper limestone plateau, just outside the village of Saint-Emilion.

Gorgeous minerality as well as cassis and ripe black cherry fruits emerge from this full-bodied 2018 that has lots of tobacco and spice-driven aromatics, again, an almost searing minerality, beautiful overall balance, and ripe, building tannins. It benefits from air if opening bottles anytime soon, and it’s going to benefit from 3-5 years of bottle age and cruise for two decades in cold cellars. Beautiful blueberries and black cherries with crushed-stone and limestone notes. Juniper, too. It’s full-bodied, yet so linear and energetic with focused, fine tannins. Fresh acidity. Really fine-grained tannins here. Drink after 2025. Juicy, winey and very compact in feel, with racy acidity and chalky minerality imbedded deeply in the core of sleek cassis, bitter cherry and damson plum flavors.

I was able to taste through all the foudres of the cuvée as well as one that’s a final blend, with all showing beautiful red and black fruits, peppery garrigue, and floral nuances.

From Quinta do Bom Retiro in the Cima Corgo, this is a bold style with savory depth. Ruddy tawny in hue, with caramelized tarte tatin, black cardamom, marmalade and intriguing earthier molasses and ozone riffs to its dried apricot fruit, as well as praline and coffee notes. Rich, mouth filling and velvety. Tightly wound, this delivers a wiry, focused beam of dried peach, date, green tea, almond husk and bergamot notes. Long, racy finish has excellent cut. Drink now. The NV RP 20 Year Old Tawny Port Quinta do Bom Retiro is a single-quinta Tawny coming in with 126 grams of residual sugar and a bar-top cork. It was bottled in February 2020. This seems pretty much on track for what the brand normally shows, but it is especially enticing right now. It shows power, depth and spice. There are classic hints of caramel and a fresh feel. That wonderful freshness is what really sells this elegant Tawny and makes it irresistible. It is impeccably balanced. The lift to the fruit gives this some extra juiciness on the bright finish. On opening, it was a bit more ponderous, but it really woke up a couple of days later. This is pricey for a 20 Year, but it is certainly a terrific one. As always, the end-date drinking window is just a placeholder—these are very resistant and age indefinitely if there is no cork problem, although they are ready on release and do not need aging. The Ramos Pintos 20 Year Tawny Bom Retiro exhibits a superb balance of fruit and wood. The aromas show a fine mix of nuances —hazelnut, apricots, sweet oak, nutmeg and the palate is smooth and well-textured. The wine's generous finish pairs it well with poached pears in a light caramel sauce. (Tasted: October 27, 2016, San Francisco, CA) From Ramos Pinto’s estate across the river from Pinhão, this wine’s complexity starts from a green tea and dried leaf scent before it fills the mouth with juicy orange and rich oak flavors. It builds from austerity to riches, generous, warm and inviting. "

The crisper aspect still shows in the lime and red-currant flavors. Great Champagne, with elegance. Notes of leaves, red dried cherry, red apple and toast. Crunchy acidity, long finish with complexity. Blend: 25% Chardonnay, 25% Pinot Noir, 50% Pinot Meunier. Salmon-orange color with aromas of raspberries, red apples, grapefruit zest, toasted hazelnuts and biscuits. Medium-bodied with sharp, vibrant acidity. Fine bubbles. Fresh and energetic. Dry feel. Drink now. This disgorgement of the NV Cuvée des Moines Brut Rosé is from September 2017 and is (probably) based on the 2014 vintage. The salmon colored wine leads to a delicate, fresh and vinous nose with intense red fruit and floral aromas and a refined chalkiness. It's a bit reductive perhaps but nicely round and fruity on the elegant and refined palate. An excellent cuvée of Pinot Meunier (40%) and equal parts of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. "

This light gold-colored effort offers up a classic, mineral-laced bouquet of crushed citrus, white flowers, toasted almonds, and spice. Rich, medium to full-bodied, concentrated and incredibly elegant, it's a thrilling white wine that can be drunk today or cellared for over a decade. This cuvée is 100% Marsanne aged in 15% new demi-muids. Pale yellow. Intense, mineral-dominated nectarine, pear nectar, chamomile and fennel qualities on the nose, along with a sexy floral topnote that expands with aeration. Seamless, concentrated and lively on the palate, offering powerful white peach, tangerine, Anjou pear and honeysuckle flavors. Focus and mineral lift are carried through an impressively persistent finish that features suggestions of Meyer lemon and sweet butter. Scents of crushed stone and scorched earth mark the nose of the 2017 Saint-Joseph Blanc Les Granits, a pure, barrel-fermented Marsanne offering from the decomposed granite slopes of the Saint-Joseph lieu-dit. Grilled tangerines, hints of bergamot and honey appear on the palate, although the rich, medium to full-bodied wine is clearly dry, with a lingering, citrusy finish. Abundant aromas of ripe pears and peaches here with wet-stone and flinty nuances. The palate has a very smooth and supple feel with a wealth of poached peaches and pears on offer. "

Floral tones persist on the palate with abundant violets. Cigar leaf comes in midway before the saturation of blue fruit takes over and washes through the oak-kissed finish. Roasted coffee bean, tar, melted butter and dark chocolate aromas are up front. An assortment of fruit and barrel flavors follow. Lightly chewy tannins back it up. The freshness is compelling. Best after 2024. "
6640,Bevan Cellars Curmudgeon,2014,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,299,14.8,0.0,0,"Bevan's 2014 Curmudgeon, a Cabernet Franc/Cabernet Sauvignon blend, emerges from one of the top sites from Pritchard Hill. Exotic, super-expressive aromatics, super-ripe black fruit, mocha, espresso and plum are some of the many notes that flesh out in the glass. All the elements are in the right place. The Curmudgeon boasts extraordinary aromatic intensity and deep layers of fruit, which makes it one of the best wines in the range. The 2014 The Curmudgeon Proprietary Red, 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of his smaller cuvées of only 132 cases. The wine is soft, round, juicy, and has essentially a near-perfect fragrance of flowers and blue and black fruits, but unusual for a Russell Bevan, the aromatics eclipse the palate impression with aggressive tannin and a slightly angular, austere character. This stands out – especially in the company of the rest of the otherworldly products he has produced. This is still an outstanding wine and it may come further together over the next 10-15 years. "

The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Hypothesis is a charming, relatively straightforward effort, yet it brings beautiful fruit. Blueberries, cassis, cedary spice, and violet notes give way to a medium to full-bodied, nicely textured, sweetly fruited beauty that's about as easy-drinking as they come. It's undeniably delicious and should be enjoyed over the coming 7-8 years. The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Hypothesis has a deep garnet-purple color and pronounced notes of baked blackberries, warm plums and blackcurrant cordial plus suggestions of pencil lead, clove oil and camphor. The full-bodied palate has a sturdy frame of grainy tannins and bold freshness supporting the generous black fruits, finishing with an invigorating lift and impressive purity. "

Released only in magnum (it's a tiny production cuvée), it reveals a translucent ruby/purple hue to go with a beautiful perfume of black raspberries, kirsch, orange blossom, candied violets, and peppery garrigue-like nuances. Gorgeous on the palate as well, it shows a medium to full-bodied, incredibly seamless style carrying polished tannins, a layered, elegant mouthfeel, good overall freshness (I'm sure the acidity is low), and a great finish.

The wine continues to unfold and evolve on the palate, offering complex terroir expressions. Concluding with a long, drawn-out and persistent finish, flavors of dusty citrus linger for more than a minute. There’s no wonder why these wines are so highly allocated and sought after.

Crisp acidity frames a ripe profile of dried apricot and candied pink grapefruit peel flavors in this balanced blanc de blancs. Offers fine, satin-like texture, and a subtle streak of salinity that chimes in on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now.

Lovely, with date and persimmon notes that are melded seamlessly, picking up light bitter orange, ginger and green tea accents along the way. Echoes of sweet golden raisin and hazelnut linger on the finish, which is polished and long. A beauty. Drink now. Earthy rather than fruity, this is all about umami, its cool cellar tones layering dark mushroom and savory black bean flavors over papaya. It lasts with intriguing complexity that would work with a range of umami-rich foods, like seafood in an XO sauce. This is a hugely dry, burnt style, very concentrated. The licorice and bitter coffee flavors are dense, layered and well balanced with the acidity. A serious wine that demands attention. "

Disgorged in July 2019, the latest release of Gaston Chiquet's NV Brut Rosé Premier Cru is showing very well, bursting with aromas of fresh peach, red berries, mint, green apples, rhubarb and pastry cream. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, crisp and fleshy, with a charming core of fruit, racy acids and a lingering, flavorful finish. This is an elegant, inviting Rosé based on Pinot Meunier. A vibrant, balanced rosé Champagne, with the creamy mousse carrying a lively mix of macerated raspberry, pomegranate and juicy blood orange fruit, with light herb, chalk and spice notes.

6698,Chateau Haut-Bailly (1.5 Liter Magnum),2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,249,13,0.0,0,"Blackberry, walnut, iodine, and sandalwood aromas follow through to a full body, round and juicy tannins and an intense, flavorful finish. This shows richness with structure. Excellent 2017. Try after 2023. A dry wine firm with dark tannins, this is destined for long aging. Concentration and a solid structure are balanced by the dusty texture and dry core. It will take a while for the potential of the juicy black fruits to come through, so this wine needs to wait until 2024. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 4% Petit Verdot and 4% Cabernet Franc, the 2017 Chateau Haut-Bailly spent 16 months in 50% new French oak. It reveals a medium ruby hue as well as a classic, medium-bodied, elegant yet also ripe style that's common in the vintage. With medium body, ripe, polished tannins, beautiful elegance and purity, and a great finish, it's a terrific wine in the vintage that will drink well for 25-30 years. A bold tarry note coils around the core of plum, black currant and blackberry fruit, while licorice root and bramble details check in on the finish. Packed and grippy, this is a touch rustic in profile at this early stage but should unwind easily enough with time, as all the pieces are in place. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2023 through 2038. "

The wine is full-bodied, its concentration impressive. Drink now Firm acidity creates a mouthwatering frame for this finely knit rosé, while the crunchy texture carries notes of ripe white peach and cherry fruit, Acacia blossom and salted almond. Clean-cut and lightly spiced on the chalky finish. Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier. Good reserve and freshness to this Champagne, which shows peonies, rose petals, bread crumbs and cinnamon and spice. A vertical palate follows, where tangy acidity punctuates integrated and creamy bubbles and carries subtle stone fruit medium-long. Drink now. Made from 73% Pinot Noir, 24% Chardonnay, and the rest Meunier, the NV Champagne Royale Reserve Brut Rosé is based on the 2018 vintage and has 9 grams per liter dosage. The nose is ripe and fleshy, with strawberry, cherry, and crushed roses. It is rounded and fluffy in its mousse, though it is dry, with raspberry, almond, and a silky texture on the finish. This is certainly a crowd pleaser to drink now or over the next ten years as an aperitif, on its own, or at the end of the night. This is remarkably closed and inexpressive with a timid and not especially fruity nose that is by contrast quite fresh. The effervescence is abundant but not especially aggressive as there is good roundness and volume to the delicious, forward and easy to like flavors that offer good but not outstanding depth and length. While the nose certainly needs time to open, the palate impression is almost ready... Disgorged in February 2020 with nine grams per liter dosage, the NV Brut Rosé Royale Réserve wafts from the glass with aromas of raspberries, strawberries, peach, white flowers, blanched almonds and pastry cream. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and insipid, with a gently phenolic grip and a racy spine of acidity, like these other new Royale Réserve cuvées it's based on the 2016 vintage. "

It comes in with 97 grams per liter of residual sugar. In this tough year, this is pretty nice, one of my happiest finds in Port. The fruit is wonderful (which is more than many can say) and it is simply delicious on opening, if seeming to lack a bit of power. If it is not the most concentrated or powerful VP ever, the next day it showed more seriously, lacking the initial flamboyance and fruitiness, but finishing with focus and precision. It has classic Port flavors. It adds great aromatics and a juicy, lifted finish. This should be approachable relatively young and it will be interesting to see if it is a long-term ager, but it is still Port and it should hold reasonably well. If it develops well, it may even be entitled to an uptick. Enticing, with a relatively high-pitched açaí and blueberry core that lets violet, menthol and star anise notes fill in easily. The floral edge stays prominent through the finish. Best from 2020 through 2035. "

Honey and bergamot notes mark the nose, while the palate features more citrus and folds in hints of pineapple as well. Long and sticky on the finish. The team at Giesen farmed two estate vineyard blocks without spraying, to encourage botrytis, then netted the vines to allow the fruit to hang protected from the birds. This is a big, honeyed wine in 2013, its concentrated apricot and lemon richness spiced by botrytis, with enough freshness to keep the sweetness in check. It finishes firm, juicy and clean, dessert on its own or with fresh peaches next summer. Peach cobbler, vanilla and spice flavors mingle together on a smooth and juicy frame, with candied lemon peel, hazelnut and chai tea accents on the finish. Drink now through 2030. "

The tannins are equally imposing. Today the wine comes across as painfully young, but the Reserve has a track record of aging beautifully in bottle, so it will be interesting to see where the 2008 goes over the coming years. Sweet mint, new leather and licorice are some of the nuances that add complexity on the focused, articulate finish. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2028. Intense and at points rustic and chewy, full-bodied and dense, with complex, firm and tannic, giving the dark berry flavors a dry savory edge.

The aromas draw you down to the palate. Full-bodied, creamy and beautiful with extremely polished, refined tannins. Yet, it’s powerful and long. Highest percent of cabernet sauvignon ever. Juicy and almost exotic, but very tidy with ripe tannins. Try after 2025 and onwards. This wine is poised, gathering freshness and good acidity in the same structured container as the pure black-currant fruits. With 97% Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine has a classicism about it: fruity and structured at the same time. Drink from 2024. Deep ruby in colour but not so inky as to be impenetrable - that is not their style. Nose subdued at first, but on the palate it unfurls to show violet edging and rich but well defined black fruits. Lafite never tries overly hard to please everyone in its early years, and this will take some time to open up. There is plenty of concentration - there are hefty tannins but they are so finessed that you don't feel them at first. It will almost certainly take a full ten years to reach its drinking window, unlike many in 2017. Its 97% Cabernet Sauvignon means a lot of the power is implied at this point, with only a hint of Merlot to soften and gently layer up through the palate. Extremely impressive. A yield of 40hl/ha, only very lightly affected by frost. 99% new oak. 3.75pH. This is a youthful tumble of warmed black currant, fig and blackberry paste flavors, entwined with bay leaf, tobacco, savory, lilac, smoldering charcoal and warm cast iron notes. Terrific stony minerality zips everything up for now, but riveting acidity and excellent energy should carry this easily in the cellar. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Best from 2025 through 2040. The grand vin 2017 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild checks as a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated blend that includes just 2.5% Merlot and less than 1% of Petit Verdot, brought up in new French oak. It shows the classy, elegant style of both the vintage and the estate, revealing a ruby/purple hue, complex notes of red and black currants, lead pencil, and cedary herbs, medium-bodied richness and depth, and both present tannins and acidity. It checks in behind the 2015 and 2016 yet is nevertheless a classic Lafite. It will benefit from a decade of bottle age and keep for 30 years or more. "

The 2016 Mazoyères-Chambertin Grand Cru is the darkest of four wines tasted from this vineyard. It has a very seductive bouquet with pure dark cherry and plummy fruit, some high quality new oak that is neatly enmeshed. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent ripe tannins, well-judged acidity, perhaps more modern in style than its peers, but you cannot deny the precision, the delineation and mineralité in the finish. Great persistence here, a Mazoyères with pedigree. Tasted blind at the 2016 Burgfest tasting. "

This was partly (38%) aged in wooden vats for eight to 12 months (depending on lot) and bottled in October of 2019. At this great price, this focused and powerful LBV is classic in every way. The structure is gorgeous and so is the fruit, although it is undeveloped just now. Its precise finish shows grip, length and flavor. This is actually not ready to drink—it's pretty tight just now. It looks like it can age a couple of decades from the vintage date. This is another super LBV from a producer who has a habit of making terrific ones. This is a beautifully perfumed wine. With its violet aromas and rich floral flavors, it has both structure and great balance. Black fruits, sultanas and a poise between richness and great fruits, the Port is still young and will benefit from a few more months. Drink from 2021. "

A classical balance of the fresh and the mature, this 20-Year-Old offers warm honey, apple and almond notes on a supple texture with just a touch of grip. The flavors are rich while the structure holds them tight. The NV 20 Year Old Tawny was bottled with a bar top cork in 2013. It comes in at 111.6 grams per liter of residual sugar. A big mouthful, this is a 20 that first coats the palate and then ends with silky texture and concentrated flavor. Very graceful, it is not as impressive in terms of mid-palate density, but it is more than respectable. It shows fine complexity, appropriate to its age category.

6760,Deovlet Zotovich Vineyard Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,California,44,13.2,0.0,0,"The 2019 Chardonnay Zotovich Family Vineyard (15 months in 20% new barrels) offers up a toasty, apple, and brioche-scented bouquet that has lots of salinity and oyster shell-like nuances, medium body, a round, mouth-filling texture, and a great finish.  The 2019 Chardonnay Zotovich Family Vineyard blossoms slowly to detailed aromas of yellow peach, pie crust, honeycomb and flint with savory undertones of roasted almonds and mushroom. The medium-bodied palate is satiny and expansive with concentrated, savory fruits, seamless freshness and a long, latent finish that hints at more to come with time in bottle. The 2019 Chardonnay Zotovich Family Vineyard is bright, airy and effusive, not to mention incredibly appealing. Lemon peel, crushed rocks, white pepper and mint give this mid-weight, taut Chardonnay terrific energy to match its saline-infused personality.   "

6767,La Ganghija Barbaresco,2016,Nebbiolo,Italy,57,14.5,0.0,0,"Leather, tilled earth, grated clove and black cherry aromas take center stage along with a whiff of fragrant blue flower. The taut, velvety palate doles out raspberry extract, ripe cranberry, tobacco and licorice alongside firm acidity and close-grained tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink 2024–2032. Enzo Rapalino from Treiso triumphed with his 2015 at the Decanter World Wine Awards, and the 2016, which is aged in barriques as well as large casks, is of comparable quality. It's very ripe on the nose but without jamminess, displaying vibrant cherry and raspberry aromas. The attack is fresh and lively, and the mid-palate is concentrated with ripe tannins and acidity. It's animated and zesty, with real flair, energy and length. Should age well, but accessible young. From three areas of Giacosa, Bricco di Treiso, and Giacone, the 2016 was aged for 24 months in French and Slavonian oak casks. The 2016 Barbaresco is rich with dark red fruits, fresh leather, cedar, and forest floor. The palate is full of black cherry fruit up front, cinnamon and sweet tobacco, firm tannins that emerge, and a long finish. Drink 2024-2040. The La Ganghija 2016 Barbaresco offers a classic read of the vintage with balanced aromas of wild berry, dried fruit, licorice, aniseed and camphor ash. If you are looking for an honest and straight-shooting Nebbiolo, this wine offers pretty authenticity and complexity. The tannins are integrated, dry and silky, but the wine should continue its easy aging trajectory over the next 10 years. A beefy style, this red shows a beam of cherry, shaded by oak spice, earth and licorice notes. Turns leaner, with dense tannins lining the finish. This will need some time in bottle to relax. Best from 2022 through 2040. "

Composed of 90% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec, the 2015 La Muse sports a very deep garnet-purple color, leaping from the glass with exuberant crème de cassis, blueberry pie and licorice notes plus suggestions of Indian spices, dark chocolate, menthol, sautéed herbs and potpourri. Full-bodied, rich and seductive in the mouth, it delivers tons of black and blue fruit preserves flavors, accented by exotic spices, framed with velvety tannins and finishing on a persistent earthy/mineral note. 3,900 cases were made.

Aromas of dusty black cherry, sage, thyme with blackberry reduction and dusty red flowers sway out of the glass. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is dusty with ripe fruit flavors that continue to be marked with a green herbaceous note before lifting tannins elevate the expression across the mid-palate.

The power is obvious, the range and definition more subtle. Drink now. You can drink this wine at the end of a meal just for the pleasure of feeling its exuberant complexity and sweetness. But you can also add a couple drops to your vanilla ice cream and enjoy the way this PX dissolves its pecan pie and candied almond flavors in the chill of the vanilla. An ample wine, this has the texture of chocolate seconds before melting. "

With some air, the plump blueberries and currants are underpinned by flowers, spice, hoisin and warm stone nuances.

The vintage gives it a precocious silkiness that is atypical. A blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it showcases this fabulous terroir on the steep hillsides of the Vaca mountains, behind the luxury resort of Auberge du Soleil. The 2012 offers up beautiful notes of blueberries, blackberries, cedarwood, graphite, espresso, licorice and chocolate along with copious quantities of glycerin and fruit. This is a big, surprisingly savory and fleshy effort from Sloan that comes closest stylistically to their magnificent 2002. It can be drunk now but will be even better in 7-8 years, and should keep for 25-30 years. "
6796,Recanati Reserve Wild Carignan (OU Kosher),2016,Carignan,Israel,49,14,0.0,0,"The 2016 Wild Carignan Reserve was aged for ten months in 50% new French oak and comes in at 14% alcohol. In a theoretical sense—not every year—this is my personal favorite of Recanati's lineup, for the combination of style and quality. This seems like a pretty fine year for it. As surprisingly lush as the Marselan was this issue, this adds a layer of depth and goes one step further. The texture runs from silk to velvet and makes this very sensual at the outset. There is plenty of flavor, some raspberries supported by acidity, all finishing very dry. The fine structure supports the fruit beautifully. You can drink this right now, but give it a year or so in the cellar to pull in the wood better if you can. Wild raspberry and currant fruit are concentrated in this full-bodied red, with savory accents of white pepper and herb adding depth to the graphite-infused finish. Full tannins. Kosher. Drink now through 2025. "
6797,Domaine Etienne Sauzet Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,2011,Chardonnay,France,799,0,0.0,0,"Tasted blind, the 2011 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is a vintage that I omitted during my Burgundy tasting. I missed out because here it out-flanked the Montrachet from Sauzet. It has developed a complex bouquet with apple blossom, hazelnut and a soupcon of cold granite. I appreciate the drive and intensity of the Chevalier-Montrachet. The palate is lively with superb precision, offering the crescendo you expect from this vineyard. It is still primal yet there is impressive energy and nervosité that will stand it in good stead for long-term aging. This is an excellent Chevalier-Montrachet from Sauzet that should repay bottle aging.  "
6798,Vaughn Duffy Suacci Vineyard Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,California,57,14.5,0.0,0,"This has a very rich and ripe feel with such intense aromas and flavors of red berries and dark cherries, delivered in a rich, suave palate that has impressive depth.

This leads to a beautifully proportioned, elegant, satin-textured wine with plush fruit, plenty of structure, and a lengthy, seamless finish. It can be approached now although it is still evolving and should drink well through 2027. Senor Lopez de Lacalle’s description of the 2007 is 'delicate, pure, and a wine of finesse.' "
6801,Schiavenza Barolo Prapo,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,78,15,0.0,0,"Lots of dried orange peel, strawberry and watermelon on the nose. Full-bodied with loads of intense fruit and chewy tannins. Really big and structured, but remains energetic and solid. The 2017 Barolo Prapo parcel is 0.9 hectares at 350 meters elevation. With the highest proportion of limestone soils, it provides the most structure of the Schiavenza wines. The Prapo is more introverted aromatically, with licorice, balsamic, and baked cherry. The structure is balanced and firm, warranting time in cellar to soften its grip. Brooding with tobacco, cherry pit, and stony minerality, the Prapo is classic, dark fruited and grounded. Forest floor, incense and menthol aromas mingle with whiffs of blue flowers and baked plum. Young and primary, the brawny palate offers dried cherry, licorice, grilled herbs and the heat of evident alcohol framed in close-grained tannins that grip the close. Give the tannins a few years to unfurl then drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit and freshness. Best After 2024 The Schiavenza 2017 Barolo Prapò is a mostly subdued wine in terms of aromas but a powerful wine in terms of mouthfeel (and its 15% alcohol content). The bouquet shows soft touches of cherry liqueur and dried blackberry that progress to smoke, tar and rusty nail. The wine is not especially intense in terms of its bouquet, but it does show a lot more intensity and determination to the palate with fine tannins and tight structure. Like the other releases from this estate, this 2017 vintage of 2,200 bottles is best suited for near and mid-term drinking, perhaps with a fatty liver pâté. This Barolo is firm and linear, with assertive tannins making their presence felt early and lingering on. Menthol, leather, plum, fruitcake and iron flavors ply the rustic profile. "
6802,Philipponnat Royale Reserve Brut (1.5 Liter,Magnum),Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,162,12,0.0,0,"Disgorged in June 2020 with eight grams per liter dosage, the latest release of Philipponnat's NV Brut Royale Réserve is based on the 2016 vintage, with 27% reserve wines. Offering up aromas of peach, pear and plum mingled with apple blossom and sweet pastry, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and expressive, with a pillowy mousse and a generous core of fruit, underpinned by bright acids. A fragrant element of lightly toasted hazelnut is a rich base note in this fine and creamy Champagne, layered with finely meshed flavors of baked white cherry, lemon curd, spun honey and pickled ginger. Plush in texture, with a fine spine of lemony acidity providing focus and definition. A very attractive and quite flavorful style with vibrant citrus and peachy stone fruit, leading to a palate that carries gently toasted cashews and quite a vibrant, fleshy mid-palate. Drink now. The current release of the NV Champagne Royale Reserve Brut is 69% Pinot Noir, 28% Chardonnay, and the rest Meunier, mostly from the 2018 harvest and 26% reserve wine. It has a pale straw color and is fresh with white flowers, ripe peach, and rounded brioche. The palate is approachable and refreshing, with pithy citrus of lemon and orange, red fruits, and bread dough. Its ripe but fresh style casts a large net. Best after 2022. "
6803,Opolo Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,35,14,0.0,0,"Deep ruby, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon features graphite-laced black cherries with touches of aniseed and sweet spice. The medium-bodied palate is grainy and fresh with restrained flavors and a long, baking spice-laced finish. It's a bold, ripe, oak-driven style that will offer enjoyment over the next 3-5 years. Black cherry and black plum aromas are cut by dark incense and savory mushroom on the nose of this bottling. There's a toasted mahogany spice to the palate, where dark cherry, soy and more mushroom flavors also arise. "

Its dense purple color is accompanied by sweet aromas of new saddle leather and roasted meats. Although monolithic, it is medium to full-bodied and intense. Given my confidence in Kongsgaard’s winemaking, it will undoubtedly reveal more “music” with 3-4 years of bottle age. A blend of 72% Merlot and 28% Syrah.  "

Firm, tight, edgy and backwards, with good acidity and a medium to full-bodied, structured palate, this smoking Pinot Noir needs short-term cellaring, but will be long-lived. "

Muscat and Chardonnay. Following in the footsteps of the Evolution White, this nonvintage blend is labeled by edition, as the mix of grapes does change from release to release.

6817,Sloan Proprietary Red,2011,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,439,0,0.0,0,"Medium to deep garnet colored with a touch of purple, the 2011 Proprietary Red is a little youthfully closed, the nose slowly revealing beautiful lilacs and lavender scents with a core of blackcurrant cordial, blueberry pie and raspberry preserves plus wafts of oolong tea and forest floor. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is gracefully expressed with stacks of mineral, floral and black fruit layers and a firm, grainy frame, finishing long with lingering earthy sparks. So wonderfully elegant. "
6818,Coup de Foudre Les Bouquinistes Chapter Four,2018,Other Red Blends,California,79,14,0.0,0,"The 2018 Les Bouquinistes is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Grenache. Bright and intensely perfumed, the 2018 is strongly marked by the aromatic top notes of Zinfandel and Grenache, which lends it an incredibly appealing dimension. Sweet red/purplish fruit, spice and flowers all race out of the glass in this mid-weight, beautifully poised red. The Bouquinistes has a bit less heft than the other Coup de Foudre wines and will be especially appealing to readers who enjoy a lighter (in relative terms) style. Lots of plums and currants with chocolate, walnut and vanilla character. It’s medium-bodied with round, chewy tannins and a flavorful finish. A little tight at the end. Better after 2022. Starting with the 2018 Les Bouquinistes, this beautiful field blend reveals a ruby/purple color to go with an up-front, complex bouquet of red and black fruits, spring flowers, candied orange, and cedar pencil. Medium to full-bodied, it has a rounded, charming, supple mouthfeel, terrific overall balance, and a great finish, all making for an already delicious red blend from Napa that I would be happy to drink any time over the coming 5-7 years, if not upwards of a decade. "
6819,Taylor Fladgate 30 Year Old,Tawny,Port,Portugal,144,20,4.8,107,"A bright, ruddy tawny, with an olive rim. Vigorous on both the nose and palate, with a classy Cognac-like spirit character and lifted drive. Well-structured, with a walnut, green (tomato plant) and black cardamom edge to its tightly focused fruit notes of dried apricot and fig, along with hints of salted caramel. The penetrating, back-of-the-net finish is very precise, lingering and in the Taylor’s house style. This is lovely, displaying warm date, toffee and persimmon notes
entwined with sesame oil, green tea and ginger flavors. Shows a
lovely interplay of sweet and dry, with flashes of hazelnut cream
and juniper contrasting each other on the long and deep finish.
Drink now. From Portugal. Caramel and butterscotch with some figs and dried fruit. Medium-bodied with a very fine texture that turns creamy. The finish shows milk chocolate, nuts and fruit. Medium sweet. Pecan pie. This wine starts with a burst of flavor, trumpeting preserved lemon, mincemeat and baking spice over a luscious, creamy texture. Then it mellows into the finish, clean and lasting, ending on the savor of roasted almonds. It would be a delicious match for sheeps milk cheeses from the mountains, whether Ossau Iraty or, within Portugal, Queijo Serra da Estrela. The NV 30 Year Old Tawny Port was bottled in February 2016 with a bar-top cork and comes in with 126 grams per liter of residual sugar. The last release of this I saw was the 2014. Obviously, the differences are typically small from year to year and they are not side by side, but this didn't show quite as well early on, whether due to it being a different release or just a different context. It shows good concentration while retaining some mid-palate finesse. It is complex, then it adds a powerfully intense finish laced with burnt orange peel and molasses as it warms. If I had a quibble, there was some noticeable alcohol, especially when retasted the next day. Some three or four days later, it was far smoother, but it is always a little edgy. Overall, this is a fairly stern style, dry and brooding, with that hint of spirits in the background. It reminds me of the stereotypical scene with Port (or Cognac), cigars and blue cheese. It just has that serious feel to it, along with that long finish. It seems to be one, as discussed in the accompanying article, that leans more to a 40-year Port. As always, these last indefinitely, barring cork failures, but they are not really meant to be held. "

Chalky finish. Drink now. The NV Champagne Brut Nature Rosé is also 100% Pinot Noir and gets its pale pink hue from short maceration with the grape skins. It pops with fruity aromas of fresh raspberry, redcurrant, and crushed seashells, while the palate is more focused with citrus of grapefruit peel, pomegranate, and saltiness on the finish. It is a lovely, food-friendly rosé that would be fantastic with roast chicken. Best after 2022. The latest rendition of Drappier's emblematic NV Brut Rosé de Saignée is performing well, bursting from the glass with notes of red berries, plums, orange oil and ripe orchard fruit. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and textural, it’s vinous and enveloping, with a generous core of fruit, succulent acids and a saline finish. "

Like the other Barolo crus from Parusso, this one is aged in barrique on its sediments for about 18 months. The result is a rather loosely knit wine bringing out dark fruit, spice and toasted nut. There is also some candied orange peel at the back. The effect is soft and smooth, and it's a pleasant drinking wine. It's another very nice Barolo from a legendary vineyard. Aromas of dried flowers, dark berries and orange peel follow through to a full body with very finely crafted tannins to the ripe and succulent fruit. Flavorful finish. Try in 2021. For Marco Parusso, the vineyard is crucial, which means farming as well as winemaking practices need to be adapted to climatic conditions. He's an enthusiast for barrique ageing his Barolos, and the nose here is distinctly toasty, but there are also aromas of raspberries, woodsmoke and dried herbs. Plump and sumptuous, it's very concentrated in the mouth, with firm tannins. It's weighty but not heavy-handed, with a long, stylish finish. Drinking Window 2021 - 2036 "

Beautiful notes of black cherries, blueberries, cured meats, pepper, tree bark, and new leather all emerge from the glass, followed by a rich, medium to full-bodied, tight, backward and unevolved Mourvèdre that needs forgotten for 4-5 years. As always, this cuvée is primarily Mourvèdre (it’s normally blended with Grenache and other varieties, even some white varieties) and there are a scant 100 cases made.

The aromas include the variety’s signature white and green pepper and blackberry. Mild and voluminous in the mouth, it is defined by its easygoing nature and herbal hints. I love the herbal and peppery nose of the 2019 Legado Carmenere, which has moderate ripeness and alcohol (13.5%) with mellow acidity and very fine-grained tannins. It has character and is varietal and a little austere on the palate, where the wine comes through as very balanced. Zesty, with plenty of fresh green herbal accents to the dried red berry flavors.

Extremely rich, full bodied, and awesomely proportioned, this heroic wine should be drunk from the late nineties through the first two decades of the twenty-first century. It seems bigger, fuller, and more powerful than even the celestial 1985. Tight and beautifully focused, with a laser beam of plum, raspberry and tart cherry flavor, hinting at cola and spice around the edges, nailed in place by lavish tannins and sharp acidity. It's an age-worthy package, already showing a glimmer of silky texture. Mature aromas of jam, spice and violets lead to amazingly powerful yet velvety medium-bodied flavors that are supported by firm but softening tannins which the extract buffers on the delicious, long and mouth-coating if ever-so-slightly warm finish.

It offers a beautiful perfume of sweet kirsch and blueberry fruit intermixed with loads of licorice, sweet spice, violets, and crushed rocks.

All the hints are there that this could warrant a higher score after a few years in bottle, but as usual, I've been conservative and called it as it is today. Score aside, this is a very exciting, unmistakably singular wine.

This is a reassuringly profound Rayas that seems to suggest that Emmanuel Reynaud has finally figured out this cold-climate terroir in a warm climate appellation. Lovely perfume, with tightly woven red and black cherry, graphite, incense, mineral and sous bois notes that stay fresh and focused thanks to finely imbedded acidity. Stylish finish. "

Full-bodied, layered and seamless, it's deep and multidimensional, with lively acids, beautifully refined tannins and a long, resonant finish. Checking in at 14.4% alcohol (rather higher than, for example, the brilliant 2009's 13.7% or the 2016's 13.3%), this is an undeniably powerful, ripe Montrose, but for now everything appears to be kept in check. Best After 2029 The flagship 2019 Château Montrose is also brilliant, although it's not going to match the all-time greats from this estate. Gorgeous cassis, graphite, damp earth, cedar pencil, and tobacco are just some of the nuances here, and it's medium to full-bodied, with a pure, graceful, layered mouthfeel, building tannins, and a great finish. It doesn't have the overall density or mid-palate of the 2018 or 2016, but it’s flawlessly balanced and just incredibly impressive. Showing more and more tannins with time in the glass, it will need a decade of bottle age and will evolve for 30+ years. Best After 2032 Lush and lovely, showing a mix of creamed loganberry, plum, boysenberry and mulberry flavors that borders on exotic, but everything stays harnessed by sleek floral and iron notes through the finish.

There’s such attractively intense chocolate and dark-cherry flavors on the palate. Super fine tannins. Some baking spices, too. Very integrated and balanced with sustained freshness and a long finish. Second wine of Chateau L’Evangile.  The 2017 Chateau L'Evangile Blason De L'Evangile is a blend of 50% Merlot and 50% Cabernet Franc, aged in 14 months in used barrels. Its deep ruby color is followed by a ripe, complex red that has lots of Cabernet Franc assorted red and black fruits, leafy herbs, lead pencil, tobacco, and cedar aromas and flavors. With an almost Left Bank style, it's medium-bodied, has silky tannins, beautiful elegance, and a great finish. The Blason is a 50/50 blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, taking a month, from 4 September to 3 October, to pick due to 50% of the vines being affected by frost, which cut yields and delayed ripening - the optical sorter came in useful to identify the best bunches. This has good freshness and a sense of energy, with bright cherry fruits. The yield for the frosted vines was down to 4hl/ha, and on the non-frosted vines it was 40hl/ha, giving a final yield of 21hl/ha. Composed of 50% Merlot and 50% Cabernet Franc, the medium to deep garnet-purple colored 2017 Blason de l'Evangile features expressive notes of crushed black cherries, mulberries and plum preserves with touches of kirsch, dark chocolate, lavender and cloves.

Linear and savory, the lithe palate is already immediate, featuring juicy raspberry, red cherry, crushed mint and star anise accompanied by taut, polished tannins. Tangy acidity keeps it fresh and bright. The 2017 Barolo Coste di Rose has bright aromatics of candied raspberry, apricot, anise, and dusty earth. The palate is medium-bodied, with fine tannins and notes of dried wild strawberry, fresh roses, and mineral-rich earth. This wine is open and inviting, while maintaining freshness and drive.  With fruit from higher-elevation vineyards in the village of Barolo, the 2017 Barolo Coste di Rose is quite elegantly downplayed and fragile. The wine reveals wild berry, cassis and lots of blue flower or lilac. A pretty mineral note recalls crushed limestone and is present through the long and polished mouthfeel. This wine overperforms, considering the challenges of this vintage that saw extreme weather, from spring frost to scorching summer temperatures. These vineyard sites performed better than most. Some 4,800 bottles were released. This wine is bright and buoyant, its midweight frame and finely honed tannins making it more imme-diately accessible than many 2017 Barolos. Scents of fresh rose petal leap from the glass, followed on the palate by tangy cherry and pomegranate flavors enlivened by notes of licorice. The wine keeps gaining verve with exposure to air, and was still delivering plea- sure three days after the bottle was opened. Sweet-strawberry, flower, iodine and stone aromas follow through to a full body with firm, polished tannins that show finesse and form. Give it a year or two to soften and come together. Aromatic, this evokes hay, cherry, currant and loam aromas and flavors. Wild herbs and tobacco accents seep in on the finish. On the dry side, but nothing food won't mitigate. Best from 2024. "

Wonderful purity of fruit, medium to full body, ultra-fine tannins, and complex notes of blackcurrants, spiced plums, bay leaf, cured meats, and exotic pepper all make for an incredibly compelling, layered, singular Syrah. This meaty, gamey Syrah would pass undetected in a lineup of top Cornas (although I think its pure California fruit might give it away). While approachable today, it will keep for at least 7-8 years. This feels effortlessly balanced. It’s fully ripe and yet hasn’t lost its beautiful savory accents—the bacon fat, the gingerbread, the smoky briary intensity that seems to have a gravitational pull on the dark cherry fruit. It’s velvety and gorgeous. Tri-tip, please. Vibrant raspberry, blueberry and red cherry aromas leap from the glass of this elegant and refined Syrah, with faint hints of iris petals and thin mint for added depth. The palate is smooth and silky, with fine, well-integrated tannins and lively, saline-inflected freshness that keeps the palate lifted and the finish vibrant and enduring. Pepper and cola-like spice unfolds on the close. Medium to deep ruby, the 2016 Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah has a pretty nose of blueberry and boysenberry preserves, cassis, bacon fat, smoke, garrigue and lavender with a dense black fruit core. The palate is full-bodied and dense with lush black and blue fruits and tons of savory accents. The tannins are firm but ripe, and it finishes long and savory. "

Once again there is a whisper of cigar ash character but in this case it is barely perceptible and does not detract from the cool aromas of various red barriers, lavender and earth hints. The energetic and well-delineated medium-bodied flavors possess a lovely texture that carries over to the dusty, linear and nicely persistent finish.

Unwinding in the glass with scents of cassis, dark berries, cigar wrapper and pencil shavings, it’s full-bodied, layered and tightly wound, with a deep core of fruit, lively acids and an abundance of rich, powdery tannins. Concentrated and serious, much like its immediate neighbor Château Latour, it is likely to emerge as one of the vintage’s longest lived—and greatest—wines. Best After 2035 Remarkably sleek and pure, considering the generally burly and obvious tannic profile of the vintage. Delivers a pure and unadulterated beam of cassis and plum reduction flavors inlaid seamlessly with a glistening iron girder that seems to have no endpoint through the finish, where violet, anise and black tea notes shimmer. Reserved overall, with a beautiful austerity, this is an example of how great terroir always shines through—even in extreme years. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2030. More backward, deep, and layered, the Grand Vin 2019 Château Léoville Las Cases is 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc that saw 90% new French oak. Just awesome aromatics of pure crème de cassis, graphite, tobacco leaf, burning embers, and gravelly earth all soar from the glass. This is followed by a quintessential Léoville Las Cases that's medium to full-bodied, pure, concentrated, and regal on the palate, with beautiful tannins. The purity of fruit is spot on, it's flawlessly balanced, and it’s going to age for decades. While it offers pleasure today, I'd wager it will take 10-15 years to hit maturity and will be a 50+ year wine. Best after 2022. Rating: 97+ "

The Castello Romitorio 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Filo di Seta comes from a high-altitude vineyard with dark soils and pockets of slate and shale. It is isolated in the mountains and surrounded by thick forests and Mediterranean shrub oak. That combination of unique elements has shaped a very articulate and attuned expression that boasts vibrant fruit, smoke, spice and wet stone. The finish is sharp and especially focused with age-worthy tannins and bright acidity. This is a muscular 2017 with a dense palate of airy tannins that give form and composure to the young wine.

Firm, tight, edgy and backwards, with good acidity and a medium to full-bodied, structured palate, this smoking Pinot Noir needs short-term cellaring, but will be long-lived. *** Outstanding *** A subtle application of wood blends into the ripe plum and dark raspberry suffused nose where again there are pretty floral and spice notes. There is fine verve and a more elegant mouth feel to the delicious and relatively round medium weight flavors that possess fine depth and really lovely balance on the lingering finish. I really like the delivery as it's lacy but serious and like the straight pinot noir this should drink well young yet age effortlessly thanks to the impeccably good balance. "

Seamless in texture and lively on the palate, offering sharply defined red and dark berry and bitter cherry flavors that flesh out and turn sweeter on the back half. The floral and spice notes repeat on a persistent finish framed by polished, late-arriving tannins.  After 18 months in 10% new French oak, the 2017 Miamup Cabernet Sauvignon has emerged with a gentle coating of baking spices and cocoa over its fruity core of plum and cassis. It's medium to full-bodied, with a velvety feel, a streamlined shape on the palate and a long, softly dusty finish. This is a solid and affordable Margaret River Cab in which chocolaty oak notes sit atop red currant, cassis, sweet spice and tobacco leaf flavors. Medium bodied, the fruit in the mouth feels plush and ripe but still vibrant and silky. Tannins offer a lovely sinewy texture. The oak flares up on the finish. Drink now–2027.

Deep ruby/purple-hued, with a smorgasbord-like array of red, blue, and black fruits as well as violets, candied flowers, tobacco, and sappy herbs, it hits the palate with medium to full-bodied richness, a deep, layered, concentrated mouthfeel, flawless balance, and that rare mix of power and elegance that truly great Pessac can deliver. Showing the more elegant style of the vintage, it checks in behind the magical, perfect 2018 but is very much in the style of the 2016. Readers will love having this beauty in the cellar, and it will evolve for 40-50 years if stored correctly. Hats off to winemaker Guillaume Pouthier for another thrilling wine. Best After 2022 What a great nose with such complexity of blackberry, forest floor, mushroom and bark. Like walking in a deep forest. Full-bodied with a dense palate, yet it remains energetic and focused. Very fine texture. Flavorful finish. Extremely persistent. Fantastic young 2019. Best after 2028. The 2019 Les Carmes Haut-Brion has turned out very well in bottle. Mingling aromas of plums and cassis with notions of blood orange, warm spices and new oak, it's full-bodied, velvety and seamless, with an ample core of bright, succulent fruit that's framed by an elegantly muscular chassis of ripe, powdery tannins and lively acids. Concluding with a long, expansive finish, it's reminiscent of a more giving, extroverted version of Pouthier's superb 2016. As is now the rule at this address, some whole bunches were retained during maceration, and the wine saw a long élevage in a variety of vessels, from classic 225-liter Bordeaux barriques to foudres and amphorae. The blend is dominated by 42% Cabernet Franc, complemented by 31% Cabernet Sauvignon and the balance Merlot. Best After 2026 "

But in this case, the two vintages show more similarities. Both wines show varietal notes and the stony minerality of the soils from Maipo where the grapes grow. "

The palate is medium-bodied, lifted, floral and fresh, with a gently chalky texture and long, uplifted finish. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Band of Vintners Cabernet Sauvignon is soft, enticing, and well structured. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of black fruit, licorice, and oak. Pour a glass and serve with a grilled ribeye. (Tasted: January 9, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "

The palate is textbook Oloroso, round, ample, warm, a little spirity, ending with dry walnut flavors. It manages to balance power and elegance quite well. Displays a flicker of sweetness running through the golden raisin and date notes, adding a flattering hint to offset the dry Brazil nut, clove, powdered ginger and salted caramel details. Stays elegant through the finish. Dominated by notes of salted almonds, this Oloroso has its fair share of sweetness to balance that saline side, making it more readily accessible to a wider range of palates and fitting perfectly with smoked pork. True as dry oloroso comes, with nutty aromas combined with caramel richness. Feels raring to go, with pumped-up acidity that boosts otherwise normal flavors of dried white fruits, mixed nuts and brine. Tight, long and driving on the finish. "

Michele Satta remains committed to the Sangiovese grape and may be the only producer in the Bolgheri appellation to produce a 100% expression of the mighty Tuscan grape. The 2016 Cavaliere pours from the bottle with a medium-dark appearance. The bouquet offers tertiary tones of leather and smoked bresaola followed by potting soil or tilled earth. This hot-climate expression shows a dark and savory side of Sangiovese. Michele and Giacomo Satta have been producing this flagship Sangiovese from Bolgheri since the appellation's inception. Despite officially not being included in the DOC because of the use of 100% Sangiovese, this is still an iconic wine of Tuscany. From this year, researching the fragrance of fruit, they have started to vinify one-third of the harvest with whole clusters. The wine is pale ruby in colour, expressive of delicious and precise raspberry fruit with roasted nut toastiness. It shows great balance between its tight-knit structure of ripe tannins and crisp acidity. Drinking Window 2019 - 2029 "

There is a bit more size and weight to the rich and solidly voluminous flavors that possess an attractive mouthfeel that is at once caressing but powerful, all wrapped in a driving, mouthcoating and balanced finish. At least some patience is advised for this youthfully austere effort. Beautiful lemony fruit, with mineral notes and bright aromas of acacia flowers. On the palate the texture is silky and lively, but there is a pleasant creamy edge to give balance. First-rate Chardonnay. This cuvée is a blend of many parcels over 9.5ha. The grapes were picked at 13% potential alcohol and fermented in stainless steel tanks, with a large percentage of the lees to give it more body - more were used in 2020 than ever before. After fermentation, the wine was aged in used tanks. Gently reductive aromas of pear, white flowers, freshly baked bread and nutmeg introduce Ferret's 2020 Pouilly-Fuissé, a medium-bodied, satiny and fleshy wine that's seamless and lively, offering plenty of immediate charm in a nicely balanced format.

The 2014 Brunello di Montalcino Vecchie Vigne takes full advantage of those low yields and deep root systems that are associated with old vines to offer a stable and consistent expression. In a vertical tasting, the 2014 vintage represents a fitting continuum between the sharpness you get in 2013 and the more pronounced ripeness and softness you will get in the upcoming 2015 vintage.

Dried roses, fresh cranberries, citrus and spices. Medium to full body, a driven line of acidity, firm tannins and a fresh finish. Scorched earth, leather, underbrush and a balsamic note of camphor slowly take shape on this. The palate is lean-bodied and focused, offering sour cherry, cranberry and a hint of baking spice alongside fine-grained tannins and surprisingly bright acidity given the hot vintage. Give it time to fully come around. Drink 2023–2030. The 2015 Barbaresco Bric Turot has a toasty front nose and not much grit in the mouth, but it's more polished and relaxed overall.

Gattera is characterized by bright fruit tones, cassis and dried raspberry. You might also recognize powdered licorice and pressed blue flower. There is a hint of cherry sweetness on the close, and Gattera offers a little more tannic structure and firmness. This is very tight just now, with a compact bead of red fruit, nutty spice and dried flowers running through the wine. Medium-bodied with firm tannins and a tight, savory finish. Excellent promise, but wait for it to open and expand. Try from 2024. Fermented with indigenous yeasts at controlled temperature for at least 10 days, then macerated on the skins for 3-4 weeks using the submerged cap technique, Bovio's Gattera is finished with 24 months of ageing in Slavonian oak. A quintessentially traditional Barolo from an austere MGA, its earthiness is a signature. Slightly garnet in the glass, its smoky woodland aromas shine, with earthy strawberry and rhubarb fruits. The fruit is vibrant on the palate with a dried cherry flavour, good acidity and great intensity. Silky at first, it has a velvety mid-palate with a dusty finish. Its slight lightness of concentration is typical of this vintage. A frank interpretation. "

A zesty acidity enlivens the palate from front to back, carrying toasty flavors of pan-seared apple, cashew, sea salt and white flower. A Burgundy lover’s Chardonnay from the Santa Cruz Mountains, the 2018 Chardonnay Estate is another terrific effort from this estate. Lots of honeyed citrus, nectarine, toast, crushed stone, and white flower notes define the bouquet, and it opens beautifully with time in the glass, gaining both richness and complexity. Medium-bodied, it stays tight and compact on the palate, with bright yet integrated acidity, solid mid-palate depth, and a great finish. As with all of Patterson's wines, it's brilliantly made, balanced, and well worth checking out. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Mount Eden Vineyards Estate Chardonnay is racy, rich, and persistent; it is a real success story. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of tart apples, mineral notes, and dried spices. Pair this with oven-baked game birds. (Tasted: October 19, 2022, Los Gatos, CA) Mount Eden’s chardonnay vines—descended from cuttings that Paul Masson brought from Burgundy around 1900—grow a powerful, earthy white with structure to spare. Fermented in French oak barrels (50 percent new), this is smoky and savory, with a refreshing lemony cut that should serve it well through several years of bottle aging. "

I know there is usually an ovest version of this wine, but if it was produced, I did not receive a sample. The Tenuta di Sesta 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Duelecci Est opens to an inky dark appearance and rich color concentration. With a big 15% alcohol content, this is a powerful wine that hits the senses from all sides. There is plenty of black fruit, wild rose, potting soil, spice and cured tobacco in this bold, hearty Brunello. Only 3,000 bottles were made. A fresh and linear Brunello with stone and lemon-rind undertones to the black-cherry and walnut character. It’s medium-bodied with a racy texture and a long, intense finish. Lovely length and focus.

The Castello Banfi 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Poggio alle Mura brings that primary intensity up a notch, and the wine shows nicely integrated aromas of spice, cedar, tar and tobacco. The emphasis here is on freshness and linearity—Poggio alle Mura is also distinguished by the sharpness of its fruit—but you get more fruit weight here and a longer, more determined level of power on the lengthy close. This brawny red is marked by leather, earth, plum and sanguine notes, with vibrant acidity keeping things focused and fresh. Muscular tannins underline everything, yet this is balanced and long. "

Starting with the 2018 Touriga Nacional Numero Quatro, which also includes 9.1% Syrah, 7.2% Grenache, 6.2% Petite Sirah, and 1.5% Roussanne, it’s a full-bodied, deep, rich monster of a wine that still stays balance and elegant, with a terrific perfume of blue fruits, violets, gravelly earth, and peppery spice. It has building tannins, but the balance is as good as it gets, and it has a finish that won’t quit. Fermented with 35% whole clusters and aged 32 months in 60% new French oak, it’s going to keep for a solid 15 years or more. This cuvée comes entirely from the Krankl’s “home” vineyard—the Cumulus vineyard in Oak View, just south and inland from Santa Barbara, on the road to Ojai. There are now just over 12.5 acres planted at Cumulus. The first plantings of Syrah, Grenache and Roussanne took place in 2004. A little more Grenache was planted in 2005.

Based on vines that average 25 to 30 years of age on loam and calcareous conglomerate soils and predominantly vinified in stainless steel, the 2021 shows a clear, bright, fresh and spicy nose. Elegant and lush on the palate, this is an intense, textured and finely tannic Grüner Veltliner that was fermented with indigenous yeasts to fully dry in three weeks. A smaller part of this cuvée was vinified in oak, which gives this elegant texture and suppleness. This is an excellent gastronomic Veltliner that can be served today as well as in 10 years. 12.5% stated alcohol. Best After 2022. "

The nose is clear, bright and open but intense and nicely developed, with spicy and even some very discreet oaky notes. Round and charming on the palate, this is a finessed and filigreed, persistently salty and stimulating phenolic wine in the off-dry style. The finish is very good and refined with vitality and mineral tension. A fabulous wine. Bottled with 13.7 grams of residual sugar. Tasted from AP no. 3 19 in August 2019. Johannisberg’s Gelblack (yellow seal) hits a fine balance between sweet citrus and racy acidity in 2018. The flavors last, steadfast on their mineral underpinnings. "

This has all that it should, with a little soft oaking, some gentle pear fruit, the barrel now adding a little toast on top. Low but adequate acidity, does not show through the volume of fruit. Very engaging. Here the equally expressive nose is quite similar to the Pucelles if perhaps just a bit spicier. The mouthfeel of the slightly bigger and richer flavors is also agreeably caressing with a positively gorgeous texture that carries over to the impressively long finish that also flashes that lovely quality of 'presence'. This is both stylish and very classy and while one could wish for better depth, more should almost certainly develop as the Pernot BBM has an excellent aging track record. "

I love the clarity and the tautness on the palate, with elegant but gutsy flavors of minerals and fruit, together with firm tannins that show Barolo etherealness and power at the same time. Already approachable. While at the village level in 2018 we seem to find more dilute wines, Massolino should be considered an exception because they produced just a village Barolo, a blend of all their MGAs, including Vigna Rionda. The wine shines for its bright ruby colour, meaty and tarry with a incredible depth of rhubarb and minerality. Open-knit with its wild strawberry and cherry fruits, it flows on the velvety palate, lean yet refined, with polished tannins and brilliant integrated acidity. The finish is all cherry kernel and liquorice root. With this 2018 the estate confirms its consistency. This red packs loads of floral, strawberry, cherry and white pepper aromas and flavors. Slim and fruity for the most part yet with a solid underlying structure. Austere for now on the finish, but well balanced overall. "

An equal blend of Merlot and Sangiovese, this is a beautifully rich and determined wine with sharply delineated black fruit that veers towards Japanese plum, blackberry, spice and cured leather. Both grapes are persuaded to show their most elegant and soulful side in this classic vintage. Hints of cedar, balsamic, citrus and red cherry on the nose. Medium-to full-bodied with firm, chewy tannins that are fresh and vivid. Tight and reserved, but exciting at the same time. A wine made by Avignonesi and Capanelle. "

Looking at their red, which is based on 70% Grenache, 10% Syrah, and 10% Mourvèdre, with the balance a mix of permitted varieties, the 2018 Châteauneuf Du Pape was not destemmed and was brought up mostly in tank, yet had 20% of the blend brought up in new French oak barrels. Despite the new oak, it has a classic bouquet of gamey red and black fruits, garrigue, ground pepper, and smoked game, with hints of flowers and violets thrown in for good measure. Beautiful on the palate as well, with medium to full body, a focused, clean, precise texture, and a great finish, this is classic Châteauneuf du Pape all the way. It can be drunk today or cellared for 10-12 years or more. It’s a terrific 2018 that I’d be happy to have in the cellar. Vivid ruby-red. Smoke- and spice-accented cherry and dark berries on the nose, along with suggestions of cured meat and succulent flowers. On the wild side, in a good way, offering ripe cherry, black raspberry, licorice and botanical herb flavors that take on a sweetening vanilla flourish with air. Supple tannins add shape to the long, spicy finish, which leaves a hint of mocha behind.  Scents of leather, clove, allspice and garrigue emerge on the nose of the 2018 Chateauneuf du Pape, a wood-aged blend of 70% Grenache, 10% each Mourvèdre and Syrah, plus small amounts of Cinsault, Counoise, Muscardin and Vaccarèse. Medium to full-bodied, it's silky-smooth on the palate, with no hard edges, showing more raspberries on the lingering finish. For drinking over the near term, 5–7 years. "

An elegant, mineral-inflected red from Grupo Faustino’s 395-acre vineyard project, started in the 1990s in Ribera del Duero’s northern reaches, this grows at the Pago Carronda in Gumiel de Mercado, where the vines rise above 3,000 feet. This takes ripeness to the very limit with a deeply saturated plum nose and a blueberry and dark-plum core. The palate has impressive depth and richness. Holds it all together. Deep, lurid magenta. Expressive, oak-spiced cherry, blackberry and floral pastille aromas are complemented by building suggestions of vanilla and licorice. Sweet, seamless and pliant in the mouth, offering plush dark berry, cherry preserve, dark berry and spicecake flavors and a repeating vanilla note. Shows very good focus and energy on the long, juicy finish, which features repeating spiciness and velvety, slow-building tannins. Malo and 13 months of aging in new French oak barrels.   "

For now it’s a little funky and a touch volatile, but the watermelon and fleshy red berry flavors win out. The palate is on the fuller end of the spectrum, but there’s freshness of character.

Tight and focused. Pretty clarity to this. Give this three or four years to open. Try after 2023. I tasted the Capanna 2016 Brunello di Montalcino side by side with the estate's 2015 Riserva and found that these two wines illustrate the vintage differences with clarity. This wine, the so-called ""classic Brunello"" from the slightly cooler vintage, is immediately more direct and expressive in terms of its bouquet. Aromas of cherry, earthy spice and rosemary essence are lifted and buoyant. However, the mouthfeel is surely more compact and tannic compared to the softer 2015 Riserva. What this wine lacks in texture, it delivers in terms of length and finish Aromas of wild berry, violet and forest floor take center stage along with whiffs of new leather and menthol. The full-bodied palate offers dried cherry, orange zest, licorice and tobacco alongside firm tannins and fresh acidity. Best between 2024 and 2031. "

The full-bodied palate combines elegance and structure, featuring ripe Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and a dollop of vanilla alongside firm, refined tannins. It's already tempting but hold for more complexity. Drink 2024–2032. Opulent and very sexy with perfume, cedar, dried flowers and dried strawberries and just a hint of nutmeg. It’s medium-to full-bodied with round and finely velvety tannins and a flavorful finish. So seductive. Drink after 2025. According to Luca Sandrone, his key to success in the hot and dry 2017 vintage was resisting the temptation to pick too early, before the grapes reached optimal phenolic ripeness. While some producers began picking in September, the San- drone team waited until early October, when cooler temperatures refreshed the vines. Le Vigne, a blend of fruit from four communes (Barolo, Castiglione Falletto, Novello and Serralunga d’Alba), indicates that the team’s timing was spot-on. The wine’s rich dark cherry flavors are laced with notes of licorice, carob and warm spice, the flavors gliding on smooth, polished tannins in a long, layered finish. Bright cherry, plum, leather, tar and underbrush flavors are the highlights of this solid red. A firm grip of tannins lines the finish, but not before the fruit builds nicely. Fine freshness, balance and length. "

There's so much transparency here, you can almost smell the compacted sandstone characteristic of Friuli's Ponca soils and the soft breezes that bring salinity and wild aromas along from the Adriatic.

Flavors of dusty black raspberry, dark cherry and plums continue their parade to a pleasurable conclusion that lingers with finesse and persistence. This may be one of the best buys in all of South Africa. Bravo! "

The 2020 Pinot Grigio Uterebner is very pretty and floral in the glass, holding my attention firm with its hints of gingery spice, chamomile and pear. This is silky, communicating a sense of opulence through its textures, yet nicely balanced by brisk acids, with a vivid note of baked apple that settles upon the senses. It finishes fresh and focused on minerality, as the mouth waters for more. The Unterebner is a wonderfully harmonious Pinot Grigio. The Cantina Tramin 2020 Alto Adige Pinot Grigio Unterebner hits its marks, thanks to great freshness and balance. This is a more elaborate expression of Pinot Grigio that shows soft apple, quince, dried herb and crushed stone. This lean-bodied white embodies mountain freshness in a bottle. This creamy white offers lush flavors of ripe white peach, guava, pickled ginger, dried thyme and blood orange sorbet framed by lightly juicy acidity and a minerally underpinning of stone and chalk. Round and balanced, with a pretty floral finish. "

8293,Duckhorn The Discussion (1.5 Liter Magnum),2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,289,14.5,0.0,0,"Breaking from Duckhorn’s focus on varietally labeled wines, Renee Ary blends The Discussion based on favored estate parcels. In 2016, it’s 55 percent cabernet sauvignon, 43 percent merlot and one percent each of franc and petit verdot. Given enough time to evolve past the almost peachy ripeness of its fruit and the significant presence of oak (it spends 18 months in new French oak barrels, then another six months in neutral barrels), the wine feels complete and completely rich. It has none of the stodginess common to cabernet, instead presenting a powerful structure, intense and gracious in its bitter-chocolate tannins. All the elements point in an upward trajectory, a path they should follow with extended bottle age. COMMENTARY: The Discussion 2016 by Duckhorn Vineyards exemplifies an excellent synergy of Bordeaux grape varieties. TASTING NOTES: This wine comes right at you with aromas and flavors of black fruits, anise, and blackberries. Pair it with a juicy, grilled, well-marbled ribeye topped with finely minced shallots.

8296,Ballot-Millot Meursault,2017,Chardonnay,France,79,13.5,0.0,0,"The 2017 Meursault Village is a blend of lieux-dits Les Pelles (below the premiers crus) and Chaumes des Narvaux (below Narvaux and above the premiers crus) with Les Corbins and Les Peutes Vignes (which touch Les Santenots). Offering up aromas of pear, green apple, peach and oatmeal, framed by a light touch of reduction, the wine is medium to full-bodied, nicely concentrated and tight-knit, with good structuring extract and back-end grip. This is a fine cuvée that's a touch old-fashioned in the best sense. This is a blend of Pelles, Corbins, Peutes Vignes and Chaumes de Narvaux. It is showing a little bit of reduction but underneath there is a firm bright fruit. Racy, dancing but also with layers of tension. The detail needs time to show, but this is promising. "

Hands off for now. Best from 2022 through 2028. Lovely aromas of blackberries, along with hints of pepper and smoke, lead into a tasty wine with even more berries and plums. Aged 17 months in 30% new oak, it's got a streak of roasted coffee, and further highlights of Dr Pepper, buoyed with ample acidity. "

Scents of violets, tree bark, truffle, purple raspberries and blackberries all appear on the nose, while the full-bodied palate is rich, dense and velvety, and the finish shows enormous richness and length. Breathtaking stuff. The tiny production 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape Hommage A Jacques Perrin is the customary blend of roughly 60% Mourvèdre, 15% Grenache, and the rest Syrah and Cinsault that’s brought up in foudre. One sexy, powerful, full-bodied Southern Rhône, it sports a dense purple hue as well as a kaleidoscope-like array of blueberry, scorched earth, candied violets, pepper, and some almost northern Rhône-like meaty, smoky nuances. Full-bodied and incredibly pure, with a stacked mid-palate and ripe, supple tannins, it’s another vintage of this cuvée that will undoubtedly offer pleasure in it youth yet won’t hit prime time for a solid 7-8 years, and it should see its 30th birthday in fine form. This is really packed, with a stunning core of pure violet, raspberry and plum pâte de fruit flavors that glide through seductively, belying the power that's in reserve, thanks to a well of singed alder and mesquite, worn leather and warm stone notes. The finish cuts a broad and deep swath, with the fruit showing serious staying power and superior definition. Mourvèdre, Grenache, Counoise and Syrah.  Gorgeous perfume just jumps out the glass here, strongly scented and inviting. This is succulent and sweet, with an almost cherry kirsch, alcohol kick to this but in an excellent way. Mouthwatering and brimming with energy, there's depth, spicy edges and a silky smooth mid palate. It's seductive and heady while also complex, nuanced and layered. A long life ahead. Such beautiful black cherries, fresh earth, sage, basil and flowers on the nose, following through to a medium to full body, firm and silky tannins and an attractive, lightly chewy finish. This is very long and fresh with balance and purity. Give it five or six years to come around and show itself. "

8305,Jean-Luc Colombo Cornas Les Ruchets,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,France,119,14.5,0.0,0,"This inky, intensely plummy Syrah balances rich, pulsating black-fruit flavors against lip-smacking cassis and accents of tapenade, charcuterie and blood. Sourced from 90-year-old vines and aged 22 months in oak (15% new), the penetrating wine is framed by fine, firm tannins and lingering notes of vanilla, chocolate and earth. Drink 2023–2040. Nicely packed, with a mix of dark currant and blackberry compote notes that are still coiled up, along with bay, dark olive and racy sanguine flavors. Persistent and focused on the finish, with plenty in reserve. Best from 2023. Maybe a touch more concentrated than Colombo's la Louvée bottling but also having a slightly coarser, more open-knit texture, the 2018 Cornas les Ruchets leads off with hints of mint, fennel, crushed stone and blackberries. It's full-bodied and rich, expansive and generous without crossing over into being jammy, with savory notes of black olives and roast meat to balance out the ripe fruit and a lingering, softly tannic finish. Laure Colombo now works with her father, Jean-Luc, to make the wines at this Cornas estate. Les Ruchets remains the family’s flagship wine, from a steep, 5.4-acre plot of 90-year-old vines. She’s kept the house style clean and fruit-forward, working with destemmed berries fermented in stainless-steel tanks, but she’s pulled back on the new oak for aging, so that it’s easier to taste the quality of the fruit on release. That quality is clear in this 2018, which brims with a mix of fruit, florals and herbal notes that makes it feel wild and fresh. The flavors run deep but stay firm, trimmed by fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. As W&S editor Corey Warren said, “it’s complex and convincing right out of the bottle,” and it’s sure to become even more so with time in the cellar. Very deep and intense. Ample blackberry and autumnal hedgerow fruit and creamy, ripe tannins. Powerful and imposing.  "

The grapes were harvested quite early and then fermented in stainless steel, managing to keep the alcohol to 13.5% in this warm and dry year. It's balsamic and medicinal, with notes of yellow fruit and some spicy smokiness, as 35% of the wine matured in new barrels for seven to eight months. It's soft and creamy without excess, combining volume and tasty flavors and a bitter twist in the finish. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Catena White Clay White Clay is a clever blend of Semillon and Chenin Blanc; fresh, bright, and zesty.

The juicy, dark cherry fruit of Merlot is teamed with the curranty qualities of Cabernet in this one’s deep, nicely concentrated aromas that show more and more layering with a bit of time in the glass, and the wine makes good on its aromatic promise with generous, fully packed, likeminded flavors of impressive length. There is a fair bit of tannic grip to contend with just now, yet its terrifically long-lasting fruit never yields center stage, and, though never so tough or gruff as to warn off drinking with juicy cuts of beef in the shorter term, this is a seriously good Merlot deserving of age that should ideally be laid away for another four to six years.

There is fine mid-palate concentration to the medium-bodied flavors that possess solid power and focus on the sneaky long, balanced and firm finish. "

A real benchmark for the true character. Needs at least five or six years to open and come around. best after 2029. The Grand Vin 2019 Château Cos D'Estournel checks in as 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Merlot coming from 43 hectoliters per hectare and hitting a healthy 14% alcohol. Brought up in just 55% new French oak, it's a pretty, elegant, seamless Saint-Estèphe that has plenty of redcurrant and cassis-like fruit as well as lead pencil, graphite, and chalky minerality. Medium to full-bodied, it has supple, fine tannins, wonderful purity, and a classy, regal profile that will be loved by staunch traditionalists out there. Exceedingly elegant and finesse-driven, with a touch of Château Lafite-like character, I compared this wine to a more elegant version of the 2016 from barrel, but now from bottle, I think 2014 is a better comparison in its weight, balance, and just overall style. It has a silky, charming style that already offers pleasure but won't hit maturity for a good 7-8 years and will have 25+ years of prime drinking. Best after 2029. Dark and winey, featuring black currant, fig and blackberry preserve flavors laced with a smoldering hint of cast iron, plus notes of anise, apple wood, sweet bay leaf and warm earth.

Polished and smooth with an array of succulent berries and blue flowers in the aftertaste. Drinkable now, but better in two or three years. Try after 2024. This is a well-balanced red with small amounts of other varieties like Merlot. Spicy, it shows well-integrated oak and tannin within a taut, elegant and lengthy palate of blueberry and black currant. A sleek, polished style, with cassis and plum notes driving through, carried by a graphite spine and backed by tobacco, briar and savory notes. Drink now. The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon includes small proportions of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec and was aged 16 months in 44% new French oak. For entry-level Napa, it's a solid effort, marrying ripe cherries and hints of cassis with gentle notes of sage and cedar. Medium to full-bodied, it's soft enough to drink now, yet it shows enough velvety tannins to age at least through 2030. Nicely done. "

Game, camphor and blue flower aromas make their way to the forefront along with crushed fennel seed. The firm, elegantly structured palate offers juicy strawberry, blood orange and star anise alongside baking spice accompanied by taut, polished tannins. Bright acidity keeps it lifted and fresh. Drink 2024–2029. This supple red is marked by macerated cherry, plum, fruit cake, floral and leather aromas and flavors. Lively and balanced, with a light coating of tannins on the long aftertaste. Best from 2024   The Salicutti 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Piaggione (closed with a black wax capsule) is pure and genuine in character, but it also shows simple lines and not as much depth as we saw in the previous vintage. However, if the goal in 2017 was to avoid overt ripeness or heaviness, those two objectives have been accomplished quite successfully in this wine. Aromas of wild cherry, rose and grilled herb are lifted and pretty, and the wine shows varietal character that is especially pure. Fruit comes from the tiny Piaggione vineyard, which measures just over a hectare and is farmed meticulously by hand. "

The 2014 Predicador I tasted had only been bottled for two weeks and was a little dizzy. But if you wait or can read between the lines, it's terribly perfumed and intoxicating, with penetrating aromas of macerated cherries and very decayed violets, a little decadent.

The base 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape is a blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah sourced from the Escondudes, Font de Michelle, le Grand Pierre, and le Mourre de Gaud lieux-dits. It reveals a ruby/plum color as well as a round, medium to full-bodied, charming style offering lots of red cherry and framboise fruits as well as spice, flowery incense, and peppery notes. It's already hard to resist and offers lots of fruit and richness while staying elegant and seamless. Brought up all in old barrels, this classic, satisfying Chateauneuf du Pape will drink nicely for 10-15 years.

The palate is taut, fresh and well-balanced with a fine bead of acidity; the 2020 gains weight towards the finish with a long, lightly spiced aftertaste that urges you back for another sip. Great potential. A rich, almost opulent style, this white delivers melon, apple, lemon cake and lanolin aromas and flavors backed by a lively structure.

They planted a massal selection in different vineyards in the village of Villafranca del Bierzo at 700 meters in altitude on very poor sandy soils with decomposed slate. It fermented in 500-liter oak barrels, where the wine matured with the lees for nine months. The wine has 14% alcohol and a pH of 3.2. It's the most approachable and fruit-driven of the years they have produced. It's quite round, with white and yellow fruit, and didn't go through malolactic fermentation. The oak is neatly folded into the fruit, and it's tender and polished, quite easy to understand. COMMENTARY: The Mauro Godello Blanco is complex and beautiful.

It’s full-bodied with super integrated tannins that give a dusty texture and creaminess. Flavorful finish of fruit and hazelnut with some smoke. The 2017 Barolo Le Coste di Monforte is an attractive, but surprisingly delicate wine from this Monforte site. Bright red-fleshed fruit, chalk, lavender, rose petal and blood orange fill out the layers effortlessly. The tannins are a bit gritty, but otherwise this is nicely done. There's good freshness here, and plenty of verve, too. Best after 2024. Aromas of cherry, strawberry and plum are joined by flavors of eucalyptus, iron and tobacco in this powerful red. Feels open initially, then astringent tannins clamp down on the finish. There's plenty of fruit here though. Understated on first nose, the Pecchenino 2017 Barolo le Coste di Monforte lacks the precision that is delivered in cooler vintages than this one was. I'd go with a medium-term drinking window and don't expect too much complexity. The bouquet delivers cherry cola and dried plum aromas with tarry spice. There is more bite or crunch in the mouth, thanks to acidity and structure. "

The lilting and refined medium weight flavors exude evident salinity on the delicious if again ever-so-mildly drying finish that also strikes me as being due to the recent bottling.

(Tasted: August 22, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The more traditional 2012 Gran Reserva comes from one of the driest years on record. It's mostly Tempranillo with some 3% Graciano matured in American oak barrels, 25% of them new, for 26 months, despite which, the wine is not excessively oaky. They wanted to keep the traditional profile but adjusted the toast on the barrels to adjust the excessive vanilla and coconut. This is structured, powerful, ripe without excess, spicy and balsamic, developing the bouquet, still young and with very good balance. It should be long lived. "

Due to a possible trademark dispute, this wine may get a name change prior to release, potentially to be called, “The Other Lady.” The small proportion of Viognier in this blend was co-fermented with red grapes, but interestingly, because it ripens earlier than the reds, the white berries were frozen and added to the reds at the time of fermentation. As an added bonus, these frozen grapes help to cool and, therefore, slow the fermentation. This wine was recently bottled, on May 22, 2020, after spending 32 months in French oak, 12% new. Coming from the more sandy soils of the estate The Third Twin Vineyard and just bottled, the 2017 The Other Lady TBD checks in as 42% Grenache, 17% Mourvèdre, 15% Petite Sirah, 12% Graciano, 11.5% Syrah, and the final 2.5% Viognier. It saw just a touch of stems (18%) and spent 32 months in just 12% new French oak. Deep purple/blue, it offers a stunning bouquet of blueberries, black cherries, bay leaf, smoked game, pepper, and violets.

The destemmed grapes were foot trodden and fermented with yeasts selected from their own vineyards for 18 days. Malolactic was in barrel, and the wine matured for 14 months in French oak barrels, 30% of them new and the rest second use. Despite the new oak, the wine is very fruit-driven and does not come through as oaky. It's floral, spicy and juicy, ripe without excess and with a velvety mouthfeel. This is approachable from early on, and even now, it has the silky tannins from 2019. It's less tannic than other vintages and has very good balance. There is more depth here, provided by the older vines, and there's more nuance too.

Aromatically unique, with Sichuan-peppercorn florality and blackberry-liqueur richness, this wine’s alcohol points up the lip-smacking tannins. Pour it next to roast pork belly with cracklings. The excellent pure Malbec 2018 Amorío comes from Paraje Altamira and shows clean varietal characteristics, floral aromas and very fine tannins, with the chalky texture of the limestone soils. It's medium-bodied and has integrated oak in the shape of some spices. It's tasty, with the 2018 freshness. "

8929,Penfolds RWT Shiraz,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,169,14.5,0.0,0,"Sourced only from the Barossa Valley, RWT is aged exclusively in French oak, giving it two major points of difference from the rest of the Penfolds range. Always a sexy, voluptuous wine (and admittedly a personal favorite), the 2018 RWT Shiraz ratchets that up to new heights in a great Barossa vintage, boasting layers of berry-like fruit, refined vanilla shadings and baking-spice notes, plus more exotic elements like star anise and cocoa powder. It's full-bodied and plush without being unstructured in any way, with a lingering, complex finish and the concentration to age two decades or more. This wine offers layers of appealing aromas straight off the bat, from black cherry and currant to cedar, mocha, graphite, herbs and black olive. Concentrated yet impeccably balanced, the palate is smudged by savory tannins while spice and dark berry flavors weave seamlessly together. This delivers power and polish. Drink now–2040. This has a very attractively fresh, showy feel to the nose with aromas of ripe red cherries, blackberries, goji berries and redcurrants, as well as red plums and some wild-herb and licorice notes on offer, too. Very expressive and fragrant. The palate has a super intense and powerful delivery of ripe red-cherry and plum flavors and immaculately fresh French oak (64% new) that really clasps and holds the finish long. The tannins are so ripe and well positioned. Drink over two decades. Complex and intense, starting with a core of juicy crushed raspberry, cherry puree and huckleberry flavors, oozing with details of Earl Grey tea, vanilla bean, sandalwood and anise that swirl around on the long, expressive finish, backed by dense, muscular tannins. Powerful, but showing plenty of restraint and promise for the cellar. Drink now through 2045. "

Medium to full body with firm and velvety tannins, which are delicious with the fruit at the end of the palate. Drink now. Leans toward the exotic side, with raspberry jam, boysenberry, vanilla, toast and tobacco flavors. Ripe and flamboyant, yet with serious structure underneath. Fine length. Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Drink now through 2024. "

Scents of violets, tree bark, truffle, purple raspberries and blackberries all appear on the nose, while the full-bodied palate is rich, dense and velvety, and the finish shows enormous richness and length. Breathtaking stuff. The tiny production 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape Hommage A Jacques Perrin is the customary blend of roughly 60% Mourvèdre, 15% Grenache, and the rest Syrah and Cinsault that’s brought up in foudre. One sexy, powerful, full-bodied Southern Rhône, it sports a dense purple hue as well as a kaleidoscope-like array of blueberry, scorched earth, candied violets, pepper, and some almost northern Rhône-like meaty, smoky nuances. Full-bodied and incredibly pure, with a stacked mid-palate and ripe, supple tannins, it’s another vintage of this cuvée that will undoubtedly offer pleasure in it youth yet won’t hit prime time for a solid 7-8 years, and it should see its 30th birthday in fine form. This is really packed, with a stunning core of pure violet, raspberry and plum pâte de fruit flavors that glide through seductively, belying the power that's in reserve, thanks to a well of singed alder and mesquite, worn leather and warm stone notes. The finish cuts a broad and deep swath, with the fruit showing serious staying power and superior definition. Mourvèdre, Grenache, Counoise and Syrah. Best from 2025 through 2045. "

(There's a splash of Hungarian oak as well.) Darker currants, mulberries, new leather, lead pencil, and plenty of herbal, floral notes emerge from this medium to full-bodied red, a pure, incredibly polished, balanced effort with loads of character. It already offers pleasure today yet should evolve for another 20 years if stored correctly. Red cherry, redcurrant and black tea on the nose. Full-bodied with silky tannins. Very focused on the palate with clear, articulate acidity. Sleek and concentrated. 93% cabernet sauvignon and 7% petit verdot. Drink or hold. "

This is a 60/40 cuvée of Aux Jarrons and Les Peuillets, fermented with 50% whole bunches and aged in 10% new wood. Sweet, tangy, savoury and autumnal with notes of aromatic spices and forest floor. Noticeable wood and menthol nuances surround the notably ripe aromas of plum liqueur, violet and soft warm earth nuances. The slightly finer though still obviously powerful flavors possess outstanding richness while delivering better depth and persistence on the firm and ever-so-slightly warm finale. "
8940,Purlieu Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,115,0,0.0,0,"Sporting a deep garnet-purple color, the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon comes galloping out of the glass with energetic scents of ripe black cherries, fresh black berries and blackcurrant cordial plus nuances of unsmoked cigars, cedar chest and pencil lead with a waft of wild sage. Full-bodied, rich and decadent in the mouth, the palate is beautifully poised with bags of freshness countering the concentrated flavors and a fine-grained frame, finishing long with a minty kick. The appellation 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley is a beauty and well worth seeking out for those who love up-front, opulent Napa Valley Cabernet. Lots of cassis, blueberries, violets, cedary herbs, and tobacco notes define the bouquet, and it's full-bodied, with a rounded, expansive texture, sweet tannins, and a beautiful finish.

Fiano is simply radiant and lusciously rich in this medium-bodied expression. The 2019 vintage shaped nicely concentrated and flavorful fruit of apricot, honey and baked pear. Only 10% of the wine sees oak, but that's more than enough to render the extra depth and soft textural richness that puts this wine a cut above the other more one-dimensional interpretations of this indigenous Italian grape. Smoke is the first thing that comes to mind as you take in the 2019 Fiano Cometa. Musky dried peach and nectarine, crushed almonds, fennel and gorgeous yellow florals join the mix with time in the glass. This is soft and lifted, as an inner flintiness gives way to savory baked apple and wild herbal notes. There’s a deeper richness here that only cellaring will help bring fully to the surface, as this tapers off poised yet long and almost salty in character. The 2019 Cometa already provides a lot of pleasure, but the best is yet to come. This is a serious glass of Fiano.   "

Like the other offerings from Snowden, it's medium to full-bodied and silky, with fine-grained tannins and a softly dusty finish. This is a very pretty wine, and while it may not have the concentration for true long-term greatness, it should offer delicious drinking for more than a decade. Lots of ripe berries and cherries with floral and walnut undertones. Full and juicy, yet fresh and linear, with lots going on. Needs time to open. Try after 2025. "

It has 13.5% alcohol, very good parameters of acidity and freshness and a medium-bodied palate with a strong chalky sensation. It's pure, clean, precise, symmetric and austere.

Lean and toned with dense tannins, yet remains balanced and long. Best from 2025. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Domaine Chanson Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru exhibits excellent concentration that is enticing and long. TASTING NOTES: This wine comes to the table with attractive aromas and flavors of blueberries, earth, black fruit, and oak. Enjoy it with a slow-roasted, rosemary and garlic-infused leg of lamb. (Tasted: February 24, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Immediately bold, rich and round, this is a grand cru wine that seems facile at first, supple, honeyed and generous. Then, the energy within the wine begins to show, tugging you back for another taste, chasing and playful in its light touch. It’s gamey and multilayered, needing to shed some of the overt generosity of the vintage, then to integrate its energy with the stemminess of the structure. This will be fascinating to watch as it ages over the next decade.  Prominent wood and menthol nuances are present on the ripe aromas of dark berries, the sauvage and discreet floral whiffs. The exceptionally rich, suave and plush larger-scaled flavors possess a seductive texture that culminates in a relatively refined and moderately powerful finish. This too is going to require at least some patience before it will be completely ready for prime-time drinking. "

Bright, floral perfume of lime blossom, ozone, blackcurrant and green apple. A strong spectrum of citrus flavours are the currency here: lemon, lime and a squirt of pulpy grapefruit zing with a faintly yeasty, almond-like character to finish.

Drink this elegant, classic, impeccably made Washington State Cabernet Sauvignon over the coming 15-20 years.

TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of black fruit and mineral notes. Serve it with a grilled, well-marbled ribeye. (Tasted: September 6, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The 2019 Vacqueyras Castillon is in the same ballpark quality-wise. Based on 55% Grenache, 40% Syrah, and 5% Mourvèdre, it’s loaded with Provençal notes of red plums, jammy cherries, garrigue, and incense. Concentrated, full-bodied, and mouth-filling, it stays perfectly balanced and has enough tannins to warrant a year or two of bottle age. "
9070,Il Borro Petruna in Anfora,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,83,13,0.0,0,"The previous edition of this wine was a proud participant of the Valdarno di Sopra designation, but mysterious bureaucratic forces came into play with this vintage, and for whatever reason, this wine was excluded from the appellation. As a result, the 2017 Sangiovese in Anfora Petruna is part of the IGT Toscana denomination. It's too bad, I suppose, but the wine's exclusion certainly does not boost my confidence in the officials charged with deciding who is in and who is out. My reaction to this wine is overwhelmingly positive. This is a pure expression of organic Sangiovese that is farmed with extreme care, down to one kilogram of fruit per plant. The grapes are fermented in clay amphorae with daily punch-downs. The clay vessels are then sealed with steel lids, and the wine is left in contact with the skins for 12 months. The results are offbeat and provocative for sure, but the wine pleases the senses thanks to its grape-skin purity and firm mid-weight texture. The freshness and energy of the fruit comes through loud and clear, and you don't feel the heat of the vintage whatsoever. I give it my thumbs up. Bright and fresh with cherries, watermelon and orange peel. Light body. Fine tannins and crisp acidity. A pure, single vineyard sangiovese made in amphora. "

Prinz noted that the older vines with their tiny berries on which he relies for his Jungfer Kabinett Goldkapsel – which, as usual, he would auction, and didn’t let me taste – conduced to excellent acid retention. But this “regular” bottling is already impressive on all counts, especially given that Prinz indicates it incorporates at least a small volume of must that he lightly acidified. "

The integration of deep fruit, richness and dense powdery tannins is breathtaking, the plush finish extremely long. The best vintage ever of this unique wine. The Cantina Terlano 2019 Alto Adige Lagrein Riserva Porphyr is an opaque and richly concentrated wine that is almost impenetrable in appearance. Prune, raisin and all sorts of black fruits emerge heavily from the bouquet. The wine spreads richly over the palate, pushed forward by considerable fruit weight and pretty acidity.

It's light to medium-bodied with a silky texture and intense, spicy, earth-accented fruits, framed by grainy tannins and great freshness, finishing very long and very spicy. From the Anderson Valley, the 2017 Pinot Noir Bearwallow Vineyard reveals a deeper ruby/purple color as well as a powerful, fruit-forward bouquet of scorched earth, toasted spices, earth, and forest floor nuances. It's a rich, powerful Pinot Noir with a more mouthfilling, chewy style that lacks some of the elegance found in the other releases here. Give it a year or two. "

COMMENTARY: The 2018 Parker West Pinot Noir shows an excellent al dente bite on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine is lively and fresh with aromas and flavors of red fruit and minerality. Pair it with fresh salmon and avocado handrolls. (Tasted: April 14, 2021, San Francisco, CA) The 2018 Pinot Noir Parker West is a more earthy, spicy wine and has plenty of mulled red and black fruits, forest floor, black tea, and herbal notes.

It’s silky and round, almost creamy in feel, contrasted by tart cherries and minerals that give way to grippy tannins toward the close. This tapers off structured, more so than expected from the Rosso category, yet also with enough primary fruit lingering on to balance. There’s a bit of a rustic edge to the 2019, yet I find it to be a nice accent to the full experience. Give this another year of cellaring to settle down. "

About 15% (a deliberate increase from what used to be a nominal 5%) of the blend was aged in second use French oak for six months, the rest in tank. Crasto's idea with the increase in oak going forward is to change the wine's texture a bit and add a bit of gravitas. This has come together really well since last seen, fleshing out, showing a bit more power and (most importantly) vivid flavor. I'm not sure if this will hold serve throughout its useful life, but at the moment, it is worth leaning up on this succulent but fresh Tinto. It comes in at 14% alcohol. "

9124,Domaine Della Graham Family Vineyard Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,79,14.5,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 Domaine Della Graham Family Vineyard Pinot Noir is a wild treat for the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine is alive, bright, and sassy. Its tight-knit aromas and flavors of ripe strawberries, earth, and black olives would pair nicely with rosemary and black peppercorn-infused lamb kebobs. (Tasted: April 19, 2020, San Francisco, CA) Medium ruby, the 2018 Pinot Noir Graham Family Vineyard takes its time to unfurl to smoked cranberries, blood orange, amaro, cola and dried herbs, with more nuance emerging with time in the glass. Medium-bodied, it walks a lovely line of broody fruit and bright amaro character, with a grainy frame and great freshness, finishing long. Bumping up the price, the 2018 Pinot Noir Graham Family Vineyard comes from the Russian River and spent 15 months in 52% new French oak. It's another ripe, powerful effort displaying lots of candied red fruits, violets, and spice notes to go with a medium to full-bodied, upfront, sexy style on the palate. It packs plenty of fruit, stays balanced, and has a great finish. It's not for those craving nuance and elegance, but if you like ripe, sexy Pinot Noir done well, you'll love this. Ripe cherries, strawberries, fresh flowers, wild mushrooms and vanilla on the nose. Subtle coffee-bean notes, too. It’s medium-to full-bodied with sleek, silky tannins and bright acidity.

Fine tannins, good length and fresh - a success in 2019. From seventy-year-old vines on a granite slope in the north of the appellation. Spends 12 months in barriques, 20% new. Much like the Les Pontaix bottling, the 2019 Crozes Hermitage Clos les Cornirets starts off with hints of crushed stone on the nose, plus blueberries and cassis and a handful of pencil shavings. From older vines (70+ years of age) and a more granitic site, it's also medium to full-bodied but comes across as slightly more concentrated and structured than Les Pontaix, with ripe tannins that shape the palate into a long, softly dusty finish. It should drink well for at least the rest of this decade. Slightly more expensive, the 2019 Crozes-Hermitage Clos Les Cornirets is more ruby/purple-hued and offers a rocking bouquet cassis, violets, bouquet garni, and orange blossom. It's pure, medium-bodied, and elegant on the palate, with silky tannins and a great finish. It's another terrific wine from this estate. "

Interesting interplay of delicate coffee and mineral at the very satisfying finish. This has many years ahead of it. From organically grown grapes. Drink or hold. Made with organic fruit, the Gulfi 2016 Etna Rosso Reseca is 100% Nerello Mascalese drawn from a 1.5-hectare vineyard located at a steep 800 meters above sea level on the blackened cone of the volcano. The wine delivers both power and grace, or the two contrasting qualities that define the great wines of Etna. This vintage reveals intact primary intensity and doesn't immediately show the age of this late-release Etna red. Indeed, the classic 2016 vintage is rather timeless in that way. That fresh fruit should carry this wine easily up to the 10-year mark and probably beyond. The wine is aged in large oak casks for two years, and 4,500 bottles were made. "

There's a lot of wine here, showing yet again that 2021 is a excellent year for quality Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough.  Mouthwatering and vibrant, with a note of salted melon, peach, mango and dried ginger on a juicy, succulent frame, showing plenty of intensity on the finish.  "

This blanc de noirs was fermented in wood before bottling. Produced from the 2014 harvest, the Champagne is now maturing well, showing richness as much as fruit.

It blends fruit from Greve where their vineyards range from 350 to 550 metres, with grapes from Radda's high altitude stony sites and Gaiole's limestone rich soils. The 2016 is restrained but precise. Intriguing scents of spring blossoms, cranberry bush and potting soil are subtly laced with vanilla and smoke. Very polished and pure on palate with mouth-watering, tangy acidity and sinewy tannins. This sophisticated, buttoned-up Riserva could do with another year in the bottle. Drinking Window 2021 - 2033. Shows real concentration for a Chianti Classico with notes of brambleberries, blackcurrants, black cherries and baking spices. Full body, grippy tannins and loads of fruit. But this remains refined and elegant, all thanks to the precise acidity. Saturated black cherry and plum flavors are framed by earth, iron and tar notes in this dense, powerful red. Shows depth and a solid structure, but this is tightly packed and should be forgotten about for another three years. Best from 2024 through 2040. This comes from biodynamically farmed, high-elevation vineyards, and the wine’s tart cherry and strawberry flavors capture the brightness of the 2016 vintage.

Heady, densely wound fruit, a greater suppleness than the Echezeaux, more flesh on the bones, sumptuous dense black fruit notes, brought back to base camp by the freshness of the finish. The lightest dusting of cocoa powder which was less evident on the Echezeaux. The pinpoint pricks of fresh mineral acidity do this wine a world of good. Perfect harmony! Showing more tannin and backbone than DRC's Echézeaux bottling, which tends to be the case, this comes from vines aged between 70 and 90 years old and benefitted from it cooler, more moisture-retentive soils in 2018. Intensely spicy, with clove and tobacco pouch aromas, impressive texture and weight, refreshing supporting acidity and lots of underlying concentration. Here too there is a touch of oak toast surrounding the notably ripe but markedly restrained aromas of black cherry liqueur, violet, lavender, exotic tea and sandalwood. The rich, full-bodied and muscular flavors also brim with sappy dry extract that possess a seductive mouthfeel before culminating in a hugely long finish. Like the Echézeaux, this is a big, bold and robust effort that should develop gradually over the next 25 to 30 years. This contrast of power and refinement is potentially one of the greatest Grands Echézeaux the Domaine has produced in the 21st C though the 2019 will be a worthy rival. The 2018 Grands Échézeaux Grand Cru is a rich, muscular wine, unfurling in the glass with aromas of cherries, sweet berries, red fruit compote and plums mingled with subtle hints of exotic spices and peonies. Full-bodied, fleshy and broad-shouldered, with an ample core of fruit, powdery tannins, ripe acids and a long, heady finish. Out of the gates, the 2018 is something of a fruit bomb, but with time it should metabolize that puppy fat to become something special. Best after 2028. "

The bouquet of the golden-yellow 2018 is noble, perfectly ripe and concentrated in its elegant stone fruit aromas that intermingle with precise and refreshing slate as well as lemony notes. Filigreed, finessed and perfectly round and intense on the palate, this is a gorgeous Chenin with intense fruit, lush fruit concentration, lots of extract, fine tannins but also finesse and balance.

Pear, spices, flowers, menthol, a mouthfeel of roundness but with remarkable vibrancy on the mid-palate and then a light-footed finish. A fresh, complex Anjou white that has rectitude and precision. This seems subtle at first, with notes of candied ginger and persimmon, but the fruit and spice elements keep unravelling one after another, all backed by finely beaded acidity that lends definition and stretches out the long, fresh finish.

9317,Wine & Soul Pintas,2018,Other Red Blends,Portugal,109,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2018 Pintas is a field blend (over 40 grapes, but the dominant grapes are Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional) from old vines (around 90 years) aged for 20 months in 30% new French oak. It comes in at 14.8% alcohol. Big, fruity and textured with velvet, this is a sexy Pintas with good balance, intensity of flavor and plenty of concentration. The oak needs to be pulled in over a couple of years, but this delicious Pintas is hard to resist even now. It should develop well and improve over the next decade (or two). How well it develops will determine its final ceiling. It is already a star. The question now is how brightly it will shine. I'm not sure it will outdo the recent vintages, but it should hang with them just fine. This red offers power, with full, supple tannins containing the ripe black cherry and steeped boysenberry flavors infused with toast, graphite and baking spice accents. A vibrant acidity keeps this focused, with elements of anise and herb marking the finish. Trodden by foot in open lagars and then aged in wood for nearly two years, this wine is darkly colored and densely textured. It comes from a field blend of old vines. It is richly structured and sure to age well. Don't drink before 2024. Closing in on 90 years of age, the Vale Mendiz parcel that Jorge Serodio Borges and Sandra Tavares farm for Pintas yielded a voluptuous 2018. The fruit comes first, effusive berries in reds and blues, then the flowers and herbs back it up, and the wine lasts on scents of bay leaf and rosemary. It’s clean and brisk with peppery refinement to the tannins keeping the wine focused and showing off its youthful energy. This will need years in the cellar to reach peak drinking. "

This cuvée comes from the Charbonnieres and Les Esqueirons lieux-dits, which are mostly more sandy soils. Its deeper purple color is followed by a concentrated, medium to full-bodied, powerful yet elegant Grenache offering ripe cherry and darker berry fruits, notes of ground pepper, garrigue, and licorice, ripe yet certainly present tannins, and a great finish. This has power and concentration to the graphite- and smoke-edged black fig and currant flavors, with a steely mineral undercurrent and charred aniseed. In spite of the decadent fruit profile, this has a nice framework and lovely salinity driving freshness and impressive length. A blockbuster red with staying power. Best from 2024. "

The wine broaches a mid-weight texture, showing some creamy density and waxiness, but it ultimately pulls back to a lean-bodied approach that is pushed forward by the wine's bright and snappy acidity. It delivers aromas of orchard fruit, tangerine skin, sweet almond and poached pear. It has the 360-degree latitude to pair with vegetarian dishes, fish or white meat.

Medium to full body, bright blackberry and mineral character. Just a baby now. Give it three to four years to soften. A beauty. Try in 2021. This balanced red shows muscle without losing grace. Black cherry, leafy, forest floor and toasty notes mingle over well-integrated tannins in a silky texture, with fresh acidity giving way to a floral, minerally finish. Not showy, but harmonious. Drink now through 2030. The analysis of the 2015 Imperial Reserva is almost identical to those of the Viña Real Reserva from the same vintage, but the profile is quite different. This is the more serious Haro-style red, and it has slightly darker fruit and a medium to full-bodied palate with very good grip, powerful but with great balance. The blend is also similar—85% Tempranillo and the rest split between Graciano, Mazuelo and Garnacha—but these are grapes from Rioja Alta fermented with yeasts selected from their own vineyards. The wine matured in French and American oak barrels for two years. The wines are different, but the quality level is similar. Savory oak and spicy foresty berry aromas are a touch gritty. A grabby palate with controlled astringency tastes of salty, lightly stalky plum and raspberry, along with vanilla. Earthy berry and oak flavors dominate a finish with tannic rub. Drink through 2035. Made only in the best vintages from CVNE's oldest vineyards, Imperial is always a reliable, go-to Rioja. There's a lovely balance here between primary fruit and slightly evolved characters. Fermented in French oak vats, the wine is then aged in French and American oak for a year followed by further ageing in bottle. A classic, expressive Rioja full of strawberries and cream flavours.

It's varietal with a Mediterranean touch, and the palate is velvety, with noble tannins, round and lush. With time in the glass, it turns more balsamic, with some minty notes and hints of camphor. 9,244 bottles, 400 magnums and 20 double magnums were filled in May 2017. It's been nicely polished by one year in bottle and has the components and balance to age nicely in bottle. Bright violet. Powerful cherry, cassis, incense, smoky oak and roasted coffee aromas are energized by a jolt of zesty minerality and a building floral nuance. Deep-pitched cherry liqueur, black currant and vanilla flavors expand and become livelier with air, picking up a hint of toasty oak spice and showing very good clarity. Finishes smooth, spicy and extremely long, with mounting tannins and lingering suggestions of cherry liqueur, mocha and cola. Raised in new French oak barrels.  A lot of charred-wood and bitter-chocolate character from the oak, but there are plenty of ripe blackcurrants behind it, showing much better on the palate than the nose.

The 2017 Pinot Noir Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard comes all from the estate vineyard in the Edna Valley and was 75% destemmed and brought up in one-third new French oak. Burgundian notes of spiced cherries, forest floor, and dried flowers all emerge from this medium-bodied beauty, which has a beautifully balanced, elegant texture, moderate tannins, and outstanding length. It will evolve for a decade. Bob and Louisa Lindquist planted this vineyard in 2005, and though they sold it in 2013, they still purchase fruit from the property. Farmed under biodynamics from the start, in 2017 it grew a savory and exotic pinot, driven by scents of five-spice and pepper, a whiff of balsamic and plum compote. It’s texture has a whole-cluster feel, pleasingly grippy, with firm tannins that give the wine a cool reserve. "

Three small plots make 6 barrels in a normal year, from a fine selection of pinot with some age (50 to 65 years). Medium deep purple, with some elegance to the nose and a bit more weight of fruit than the Volnay Santenots. Delicious perfume with some cherry notes, a very slight bitterness. Picked at the right time. Indeed Charles picked this earlier in the series than usual, a good idea. This is aromatically quite similar to the Santenots though the partial whole cluster vinification adds a floral top note. There is equally good volume to the medium-bodied flavors though not quite the same vibrancy on the textured, complex and ever-so-mildly rustic finish where a hint of bitter pit fruit arises. "

The palate is softly framed, fresh and open, with intense juicy berry fruits and a long, uplifted finish. This comes mainly from the Yu-ki vineyard this vintage. Ripe strawberry, toasted thyme and cardamom on the nose. Medium-to full-bodied with good depth of flavor. Tight tannins carry punchy, bright red and black fruit and an earthier note pushes through toward the end. Really fresh. Drink or hold. "

9498,Vina Ventisquero Enclave Cabernet Sauvignon,2015,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,67,13.5,0.0,0,"Their top Cabernet from Maipo, the 2015 Enclave Cabernet Sauvignon is from a warm and dry year, despite which the wine has 13.5% alcohol. The overall sensation is quite ripe, coupled with some notes of fountain pen ink, tempera paint, licorice and a touch of leather, with a classical palate that feels more like a Bordeaux than a Maipo. It kind of made me laugh when winemaker Felipe Toso told me someone had made that same comment to him. The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Enclave from Pirque, Maipo, was aged for 18 months in one-half new barrels. Dark garnet red in the glass. The liqueur-like nose offers notes of black currant, mint, maraschino cherry and beeswax over a bed of hazelnut and aromas from the aging process. Indulgent and broad with an oxidative character that fills the palate with flavor; the finish is bold. Very ripe and rich with plum character. A big and oaky cabernet that's got a harmony in spite of the almost monolithic tannins. "

They started producing reds in 2019 with the varietal 2019 Mencía, which comes through as creamy and oaky, varietal, fruit-driven and straightforward. It has 14.5% alcohol and is ripe, juicy and round with notes and flavors of sweet spices and smoke.

A beautiful perfume of wild strawberries, ripe black cherries, licorice, ground pepper, and bouquet garni all define the bouquet, and it's medium to full-bodied and has tons of Provençal charm, ripe tannins, and a great finish.

It’s full-bodied, tight and chewy. Blue flower, crushed botanical herb, crushed berry and sunbaked earth aromas slowly take shape in the glass. The compact, rather austere palate features dried cherry, blood orange, licorice and a hint of coffee bean alongside tightly wound, fine-grained tannins. Valeirano is located in Treiso with limestone and white marne soils and is sourced from vines planted in 1971. The 2017 Barbaresco Valeirano is aromatic of cranberry compote, vanilla bean, smoke, and anise. On the palate, there is ripe pomegranate, black tea, and blood orange with fine building tannins. A classic but accessible expression of fruit from a two-hectare site in the village of Treiso (with its rolling hills and wide views of the beautiful Barbaresco landscape), the Ada Nada 2017 Barbaresco Valeirano reveals a silky and lean appearance with wild berries and crushed flowers. There is an almost exotic touch to the bouquet with hints of coriander or saffron. When all is said and done, this Barbaresco shows character and depth and will be a pleasure to open with a small serving of risotto alla Milanese in the next few years. "

9580,Hush Heath Estate Balfour 1503 Classic Cuvee,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,England,39,12,4.1,5,"Classically structured and beautifully balanced, delicate fruit aromas dance with creamier, toastier ones. It hints at jasmine, white peach, apple with custard and lemon oil. There’s a silkiness to the mouthfeel, then a crunch of acidity and fine bubbles. Those delicate aromas flow seamlessly into flavors. A poised and ultra-food-friendly bottling. The back label suggests fish and chips. The year 1503 was when Hush Heath Manor in Kent (home of the Balfour-Lynn family who own this wine estate) was founded. Exclusive to the Co-op, this blend uses grapes from Hush Heath's newest vineyard, planted in 2002, for a fresh, fruit-forward style. It is a well-made wine with a fresh, fine mousse and crisp acidity. There's lemon balm, white flower and green apple notes plus a hint of red berry fruit on the tight palate. Offering up attractive aromas of yellow orchard fruit, warm biscuits and citrus rind, the attractive NV Brut Classic Cuvée 1503 is medium-bodied, fleshy and charming, with a generous core of fruit, integrated acids and a nicely defined finish. This is a generous, inviting Brut that's immensely easy to drink. "

It fermented in stainless steel and oak vats with indigenous yeasts and matured in 500- and 600-liter French oak barrels for 18 months. This has very good ripeness but without excess and is a little closed and austere. It has the cold sensation of the granite. It's very balanced and should develop nicely in bottle. This is one step up from the previous years. "

This pretty wine slides along the palate, imparting notes of wild cherry, crushed stone and rusty nail. It makes an especially good showing on the palate with nice structure and a long finish. Fascinating, broody nose of rich, ripe red berries and cherries, together with forest-floor notes that range from moss to mushrooms to dark flower petals. Even some meat. Full-to medium-bodied with a deep core of fruit and minerals, The tannins are well integrated though still lightly firm, truncating the finish a little for now. Give this ample time to settle in.

Shows harmony between the sweet fruit and refined tannins, ending in a kaleidoscope of fruit, mineral
and tobacco accents. Best from 2021 through 2036. I had the opportunity to visit the stunning Castello di Meleto on my last trip to Gaiole in Chianti, and I fell in love with the frescoed rooms, panoramic gardens and the miniature actors' theater. You can see a sketch of the outside walls of this magnificent architectural masterpiece on the front label of this wine. You might also notice the date of the Castello's founding—in faraway 1256. Imagine, if you can, what the world was like back then. The 2015 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione offers a traditional rendering of the Sangiovese grape. It takes care to highlight the aromatic intensity of the variety, with rose, violet, wild berry and potting soil. It also showcases the grape's characteristic mid-weight build and fresh acidity. "

Focused and fine. Sophisticated. Tangy finish. Very long. This red is all about finesse and elegance, with a silky texture aligned to black cherry, blackberry, violet and almond aromas and flavors. Beautifully balanced and long, with pure fruit echoing on the finish. Drink now through 2026. The 2020 Barbera d'Alba Superiore Vigna Mosconi Fides delivers big ripeness and fruit weight with inky dark intensity, mature blackberry and syrupy blackberry or cherry essence. This hot vintage comes close to going overboard in terms of ripeness, but it is ultimately reined in by the grape’s fresh acidity. "

While the nose is marked by scents of redcurrants and gentle herbal shadings, the palate is full-bodied but taut and juicy, with silky but firm tannins and ample length. Aromas of blueberries, plums, dried oregano, earth, tar and peppercorns. Medium-bodied with fine tannins and lively acidity. Vibrant and juicy with a crunchy finish. Drink now or hold. "

It is pure, precise and refined on the nose, with concentrated, ripe white peach aromas intertwined with floral and herbal notes (i.e. woodruff). This is a medium to full-bodied, dense and crystalline, beautifully pure and elegant Riesling with finely concentrated apricot and peach aromas (but with this coolish touch), spectacularly precise and salty acidity that cuts the apricot like a laser sword and fine tannin grip on the stimulatingly bitter finish. This is another remarkable terroir wine from the Domäne, and I would keep to for at least 10 years, although it already tastes very attractive. This sleek and dry riesling has a degree of purity and positive raciness that’s uncommon in the Wachau in 2020. Plenty of Amalfi lemon and white currant, but also pronounced minerality through the long, very clean finish. Drink or hold. "

Shows terrific balance and depth, with a tightly wound structure that bodes well for future development.  Ripe, musty fruit on the nose and palate. Medium-bodied with fine, firm tannins and good drive on the finish.  The Luigi Baudana 2018 Barolo Baudana is a full and generous wine, somewhat surprisingly so considering the understated personality of this vintage. That volume makes this bottle stand out in a crowd of 2018 releases. Dark cherry, plum, spice, rust and crushed flowers make for a soft and readily accessible wine. This Barolo is oak fermented and aged in large Slavonian oak casks. Best After 2023 "

The wines from 2018 are more delicate, have very good precision and feel fresh but have structure and balance and incisive tannins, and this is a very good example of it. This has 13.9% alcohol and 5.92 grams of acidity, showcasing a year of lower alcohol (most wines from 2018 are below 14%) and higher acidity.

The bouquet is very floral, and you could throw in some violet and lilac as well. A pale coral-pink colored rose with aromas of wild strawberries, ripe peaches, orange rind and minerals.

It’s full-bodied, yet composed and compact with ultra fine tannins and a long, flavorful finish. Very structured. Try after 2024. This is all about the ripe fruit, which is beginning to hit a sweet spot. Cherry, currant, cut hay, eucalyptus, iron, tar and tobacco flavors mingle, showing beautiful balance and length. There are still serious tannins that need to be resolved. Best from 2023 through 2047. The 2013 Barolo Riserva Cannubi 1752 opens a wider window onto one of the most applauded and balanced vintages in recent years. The 2013 growing season was long and had cool nights going into harvest. These conditions helped to develop the aromatic intensity and precision of the bouquet and the linear tendencies of the mouthfeel. Made with a special selection of fruit from the Cannubi vineyard, this Riserva shows dark cherry, cassis, iron ore, licorice and camphor ash. The wine has aged enough to give you an idea of where it's going, and the best bet is to let it continue its journey. I suggest a medium to long drinking window for this top-shelf bottle from Damilano. "

Taut and linear, with fine balance and a long, red fruit, stone and savory aftertaste. This delicate, midweight wine opens with scents of fresh cherry and dewy rose petal that lead into tangy red berry flavors brightened by a twist of orange zest. Some dark mineral tones emerge with air, but this is a wine to enjoy in the next five years. Aromas recalling camphor, woodland berries, mint and French oak waft out of the glass. Reflecting the nose, the elegant, linear palate offers tart cherry, star anise and espresso framed in taut, close-grained tannins. "
9653,Morey-Coffinet Batard Montrachet Grand Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,579,0,0.0,0,"A slightly riper mix features notes of both white and yellow peach, acacia blossom and plenty of exotic spice nuances, and in particular jasmine. The sleek, intense and beautifully precise broad-shouldered flavors deliver stunningly good length on the compact and superbly well-balanced finale. This is presently very, very backward, which is just as well as more depth does need to develop but that shouldn't be an issue if at least some forbearance is exercised. Assuming this stunner of a Bâtard fulfills its potential, the word brilliant comes to mind. "

Otherwise the exceptionally rich, even opulent, flavors possess evident minerality on the citrusy and moderately dry finale. While the generously proportioned mid-palate will permit early accessibility, the firm supporting acidity should permit this to age well over the mid-term. "

It’s a juicy pinot that could stand up to fire-grilled pork riblets. This is a sultry, brooding red wine, exuberant in black cherry, black tea, forest floor and rose petal. With a supple backbone of integrated tannin and toasted oak, it reaches a velvety finish of cola that accentuates its full-bodied style and enduring richness. "

Impressively long, this never wavers in its elegance. An elegant rosé Champagne, layering flavors of ripe cherry, blood orange sorbet and orchard blossom on the delicate, finely detailed mousse, with lightly mouthwatering acidity and a zesty underpinning lending focus through to the lightly spiced finish. Drink now through 2027. 400 cases imported. Offering up attractive aromas of blood orange, red berries, peach, orchard fruit and brioche, Henriot's just-released 2012 Brut Rosé Millésimé is medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, with fine concentration, ripe but racy acids, a delicate mousse and a long, saline finish. This is one of the more intense, vinous wines to emerge from Henriot in some time, and it's very promising. Aromas of sliced ripe strawberries with pomegranate. Some granite and earth, too. Full-bodied and very vinous with firmness to the texture and fine bubbles. Mushroom, berry and earth in the aftertaste with some citrus fruit. Very vinous. Pinot noir and chardonnay.  This blend of 55 percent pinot noir with chardonnay gets its deep pink-rose color from an addition of 10 percent red wine; all of the fruit comes from either premier or grand cru sites. It’s elegant, vinous and dry, with some tannic austerity from the pinot noir that brings to mind crushed flower petals. There’s yeasty richness to balance that austerity, filling out the flavors and suggesting it will age well. "

It’s round in feel with a core of green-citrus tinged acidity and saline-mineral tones that add a reverberation of cheek-puckering tension. Notes of tart Granny Smith apples and lime zest linger long, keeping the Grillo Mozia seated firmly in the green fruit profile, while leaving the palate thirsting for more. Very nice. "

Sleek and soft on the palate, it leads to an integrated finish of baking spice, toasted oak and leather. From a vineyard on Bradford Mountain planted in 1974, this is a savory zin with woodland scents and tannins with the spice of flower petals and a rocket-green bite. The texture turns silky with a day of air, the bright fruit needing bottle age to come forward. "

Poggio Antico is another one of those Montalcino estates that you will forever remember if you've been lucky enough to visit. The vineyards enjoy unobstructed views all the way to the Tyrrhenian Sea (I think this is the only place in the appellation where you can see the water on a clear day). Fruit for the 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is sourced from the I Poggi parcel with thin galestro and alberese soils. There is a lot of fresh fruit here, and the tannins are quite soft and supple.

Smooth and vibrant, the elegant palate delivers dried cherry, strawberry, star anise, pipe tobacco and mineral framed in polished tannins and bright acidity. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2017–2027. The soils of the Grumello subzone are sandier and less rocky than those of Sassella, and in 2007 yielded a wine that is open and expressive, its red- cherry flavors accented by notes of white truffles and dried leaves.

Silky textured, fresh and vital on the palate, this is a full-bodied, juicy but also straight and tight Cabernet Franc with an intense and elegant, fruity texture that represents both layers of the terroir: sand and tuff limestone.

The nut and oak spice is more prominent on the palate, but a crystalline acidity and a long citrus and stone fruit finish beautifully balances the oak influence. Restrained and elegant with freshness and length, this should cellar well into the 2040s. I like the crushed oyster shell notes here with white grapefruits, peaches, pineapples, mango stones, wild thyme and hints of nutmeg. Wonderful complexity and interplay of fleshy tropical and citrus fruit on the palate with a bright, saline minerality. Plenty of texture with an openness and juicy finish. Just right now.

Brooding blackberry and black-cherry flavors get a boost of complexity in the form of peppery spice: a mix of white pepper, nutmeg and clove. Adrian Manspeaker blends this wine from three sites—Dutcher Crossing (60 percent), Grist and Raymond Burr. Fermented with ambient yeasts and aged for 18 months in François Frères and Rousseau barrels (25 percent new), its gentle and bright layers of red fruit and herbs gain depth and complexity with air. The wine has sunny freshness and clarity to its full-on flavors—Berkshire sommelier Michael Kowalski found it “rich enough for a ribeye with Béarnaise sauce.” "

They now have almost three hectares in this cru. Glistening ruby-red. Ripe, spice-tinged blackberry, cherry cola, licorice and pungent floral qualities on the fragrant nose. Intense red and dark berry liqueur flavors are energized by building spice and smoky mineral flourishes. Concentrated as well as lively and focused, finishing with strong, youthfully tannic persistence and suggestions of candied violet and exotic spices. "

The palate is medium-bodied with a gorgeous fleshy, almost silky texture matched with a fine bead of acidity. It does not possess the persistence of the nascent 2018, but it feels delineated, with just the right amount of spice on the aftertaste. Very fine. A village wine it may be, but this single-parcel red comes from an 80-year-old vineyard and is as good as many premier cru bottlings. It is ripe, dense and appealingly textured, with some tannic backbone, attractive 40% new wood and a slight volatile lift. "

The winery features some difficult whites, like the As Olgas, but this is the winery's version of a classic fresh white, bright, a bit fruit forward and with perfect balance. It has enough concentration to go with the beautiful supporting acidity. The fruit is tasty too, but this is acid driven. I am not sure how long it will last, but if only five or six years, that's not a flaw, just something this isn't really intended for.

This pretty wine is nicely balanced and elegant with a mid-weight approach and a terrific sense of aromatic purity and delivery. That underlying power does continue to the palate, where the wine is tightly stitched together and quite determined in length. The tannins do a good job of keeping the wine tight and focused. This is another impressive effort from Piancornello. Plum, dried-berry, cherry and rose-stem aromas follow through to a medium body with firm, silky tannins and a flavorful finish. Shows length and structure, yet a creamy mouth-feel. Lovely craftsmanship to this. Drink in 2024 and onwards. "

Boasts plenty of fruit, orange zest and iron, yet still has to reveal all its charms. Compact finish in the end, but be patient. Best from 2024 through 2042. Sporting broad shoulders and a brawny texture, the 2018 Chianti Classico Riserva Berardenga is one of those wines that you can drink throughout the entire meal from antipasto, to pasta to the meat dish. This Riserva offers dark fruit, ripe cherry, plum and soft concentration throughout.

Showcases both power and elegance, with chai, cigar box, violets and dried sage notes, velvety and generous, on the long, generous finish. Drink now through 2035. 1,900 cases made, 370 cases imported. Where the cool 2017 brought increased elegance to Hickinbotham's muscular reds, this vintage returns to the powerful expression of warmer years. A big wine it may be, with a nose of strawberry and cherry preserves, mint, medicinal herbs and a toasty, vanillin underbelly, but it's also precise and site expressive. Tannins are fine yet powerful, and the oak is present, but this is a baby, worthy of many years in the cellar. Drink 2023–2035. A striking wine for its extreme depth, as well as freshness. Ripe dark plums and blackberries bathe the nose and palate. This is lead in a fuller-bodied direction and makes a very youthful, bold and stoic impression on the palate. Fine now, but better in three to four years. The emphasis at Hickinbotham is on Bordeaux varieties, but the Shiraz is a sleeper—and well priced for the quality. The 2018 Brooks Road Shiraz includes 10% whole clusters and was matured in 30% new French oak. There was one new foudre, while the rest of the wine aged in 300-liter hogsheads. The nose is marked by scents of raspberries and vanilla, with some floral, herbal notes and hints of barrel char. In the mouth, it's medium to full-bodied and mouthwatering, with a long, silky-textured finish. A completely satisfying drink, it's rich without being at all over the top. "
9804,Manincor Reserve del Conte Rosso,2020,Other Red Blends,Italy,27,13,0.0,0,"For an entry-level wine this has a strikingly original nose of redcurrant, amarena cherry and pomegranate with a whiff of smoke.

Beautiful notes of pear, white flowers, citrus, and some salty, mineral-like nuances define this beauty, and it's medium-bodied, with terrific balance, integrated acidity, and a great, great finish. Bravo. Drink this over the coming 2-4 years. Brimming with stone-fruit aromas with a touch of mango, this is a rich but very clean and crisp dry white from the Southern Rhone.

9816,Lisini Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,66,14.5,0.0,0,"Delicious and full-bodied, this offers aromas of pine forest, spiced plum, leather and fragrant purple flowers. On the enveloping palate, noble tannins support ripe Morello cherry, raspberry jam and baking spice before a licorice close. Drink 2027–2032. Located in the southern reaches of the Montalcino zone, near Sant’Angelo in Colle, Lisini is one of the last in the area to harvest. The wines are full-figured, sumptuous and densely packed yet remain wondrously light on their feet. The 2017, which was harvested between the end of September and beginning of October, is no exception. Dripping with ripe cherries and plums, it is a seductive, rather fruit-driven wine shored up by luscious acidity. Clayey tannins wrap around the palate with an iron grip and just a hint of dryness is absorbed by plush, pulpy fruit. This is hard to resist now. Drinking Window 2023 - 2030 The Lisini 2017 Brunello di Montalcino (with 30,000 bottles made) has some of the baked blackberry aromas and cherry liqueur that are characteristics of this dry and hot growing season. The wine opens to a darkly saturated appearance, and it follows up with tarry smoke, licorice root, crushed stone and potting soil. The wine's personality reflects autumnal flavors of forest floor and balsam herb. A rich version, this red reveals cherry, raspberry, rose, mineral and wild herb aromas and flavors, backed by a solid matrix of tannins. Firms up on the finish, yet remains fresh and long, echoing the red fruit and wild herb notes. Best from 2024. This shows aromas of very ripe cherries and berries. Full-bodied, very tannic and powerful. Chewy and intense. Berry and citrus character at the finish. It should come around. Try after 2024 when the tannins will have softened. "
9817,Pecchenino Bussia Barolo,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,72,0,0.0,0,"A core of pure cherry is the hallmark of this alluring red. As this gathers intensity on the palate, rose, strawberry, menthol and iron notes chime in. Backed by vibrant acidity and refined tannins, this leaves a long aftertaste of fruit, mineral and savory elements. Lots of dried flowers here with blackberry and ripe-strawberry aromas that follow through to a medium body with very fine tannins that integrate nicely into the wine. Fresh and vivid at the end. Drink after 2023. "
9818,Marimar Estate Don Miguel Vineyard La Masia Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,California,41,0,4.2,6,"A full-bodied white with ripe aromas of cooked apple, mango and yoghurt. Toasty undertones. It builds on the palate with loads of fruit and intensity. Rather old-school chardonnay, but solid. Drink or hold. A fragrant chardonnay with scents of lilies and fresh apricots, this tastes youthful and clean. While it’s barrel fermented and undergoes malolactic conversion, it isn’t overtly oaky or buttery; instead, a touch of vanilla cream adds gentleness to the fruit. Serve it with pork roasted with apricots. From the producer's 30-acre estate of Chardonnay planted to three clones, blended together here, this white offers pronounced flavors of stone fruit and vanilla bean. Soft, smooth and rounded, it has enough acidity to keep in balance and touches of nut and baking spice to give it a savory finish. "

Ripe melon with a hint of papaya on the nose, but that doesn’t make this the least bit opulent. This one's all peaches and cream, as they say in the South. The 2018 Alto Adige Pinot Grigio Riserva Giatl brings big soft intensity and lots of plush fruit. Peach, poached pear and passion fruit explode from the bouquet in an expression that affords lots of nice richness. The oak fermentation at nearly room temperature results here in a soft and integrated white to enjoy with a shrimp étouffée. "

This is not a well-known Chambolle premier cru but on this showing it deserves greater fame! A ripe, spicy and beautifully layered nose speaks of liqueur-like aromas of cassis, violet and essence of dark cherry. The rich, even opulent, larger-scaled flavors manage to retain good refinement on the palate soaking, sappy and impressively persistent finish. Good stuff that should repay mid-term cellaring. "

Citrus and floral overtones give the 2017 a wonderful sense of freshness to play off its mid-weight structure. This is such an impressive wine in every way. The 2017 Chardonnay Sonoma Coast has delicate wafts of hay, golden apples, saline and crushed almonds with floral hints.

The core of fig, black currant and blackberry compote flavors is intense, with notes of espresso cream, dark tobacco and tar flowing underneath.

Fruit comes out at the end. Drink after 2024. The Damilano 2017 Barolo Cerequio opens to thin concentration and a light garnet appearance. There are many elements on the bouquet, starting with a lean cherry or cassis that segues to earth, grilled herb and button mushroom. You may also recognize crushed flowers and pressed rose. This wine offers a relatively soft and contained bouquet, but then it shows a lot more structure and textural power on the palate. Aromas of camphor, blue flowers and tilled earth shape the nose. Savory and smooth, the palate features raspberry compote, baking spice and licorice set against polished, fine-grained tannins. It's already almost accessible but will also offer years of drinking pleasure. Enjoy 2023–2029. Haunting aromas of rose, cherry, eucalyptus, hay and iron are the highlights of this tightly wound, yet expressive Barolo.

The palate then brings in crystallised Mandarin, walking that tightrope between sweet abandon and tingling acidity. It does so in a dancing, slender and agile fashion. This offers a superb highwire act that makes a virtue of the very weightlessness of the wine.  You’d never think that a sweet riesling from so far south could be so amazingly fresh. Roughly in the style of a Mosel riesling Spätlese, this is dangerously juicy, with wonderful pink-grapefruit and red-fleshed vineyard-peach character. So complex and so invigorating. Vegan. Sustainable.  From the barren red slate soils with its many quartz inclusions of the ried Dr. Wunsch comes the 2019 Phyllit Riesling Spätlese ""Dr. Wu...""—a juicy, intense and crystalline, wonderfully mineral, piquant and terroir-driven Riesling in the demi-sec style (legally this is a sweet Spätlese, but due to its quartzite and slate nerviness, the sugar is not that prominent to the taste). Due to the DAC regulations, according to which only dry wines may be marketed as single-vineyard wines, the true origin of Dr. Wunsch comes out only cryptically on the label, which is why there are ellipses where the rest of the vineyard's name should be.

It's a richer, bigger wine that offers loads of brioche, caramelized peach, quince, white flowers, and crushed rock-like minerality. Medium to full-bodied, beautifully textured, balanced and long, with good acidity, it's a beautiful wine that's going to age gracefully. COMMENTARY: The 2017 Château de Nalys Châteauneuf-du-Pape Blanc Grand Vin is bold and dramatic. TASTING NOTES: This wine excites the palate. Enjoy its excellent aromas and flavors of dried fruit and earthy spices with a roast pork tenderloin. (Tasted: January 2, 2020, San Francisco, CA) This is 'the vision of Guigal in Nalys' according to Philippe Guigal. It has floral and citrus notes on the nose, primarily lily. Cashew notes from the oak are secondary to the fruits and flowers, discreet and well-integrated. The palate is rich, weighty and concentrated, with bright acidity running through it to a long finish. It has a drinkability thanks to its purity and clarity of flavour, but it also displays the intensity and regal texture of good white Châteauneuf-du-Pape. A blend of 43% Roussanne, 33% Grenache Blanc, 15% Clairette, 6% Bourboulenc and 3% Piquepoul.
Drinking Window 2019 - 2025 A solid first effort from the new ownership, the 2017 Chateauneuf du Pape Grand Vin Blanc is a blend of 43% Roussanne, 33% Grenache Blanc, 15% Clairette, 6% Bourboulenc and 3% Picpoul. Seventy percent of the blend aged in oak, but I'd say that component is discrete, adding just a hint of pencil shavings and a fine-grained, silky texture. It's full-bodied and succulent, delivering an attractive combination of pineapple and saline notes with understated elegance. "

COMMENTARY: The 2016 Saints Hills St Roko is bight, rustic, and pleasing on the palate.

A blend of early-picked pinots noir, gris and blanc as well as chardonnay and grüner veltliner from the chalky parcels of the estate, it ferments in stainless steel, then rests for a year in Austrian oak barrels before undergoing a secondary fermentation in bottle. That long, slow process allowed the wine to accumulate a profound depth of flavor. It tastes of buttered toast and apricot jam, of Cognac and button mushrooms, with a little lemon zing. It’s an opulent, elegant sparkler, worthy of lobster with drawn butter or your favorite buttery indulgence. Notes of Golden Delicious apple and rye bread crumb on the nose signal both freshness and autolytic richness. The palate then portrays salty, buttery short crust, still imbued with that apple freshness, set against yeasty texture and depth, pervaded by lemon freshness and enlivened by creamy, fine, salty foam.

Notes of tar and licorice underline this wine’s bright red-cherry and orange-peel flavors. Mid-weight in body, with an open-knit structure, the wine’s appeal is in its mouthwatering acidity and juicy fruit. "

Full-bodied, yet tight and compact with clear, focused fruit and chewy tannins. Flavorful finish. Drink after 2024 and onwards. With fruit from the heart of the Barolo appellation, the Virna 2017 Barolo Sarmassa (with only 3,000 bottles made) opens to a silky, lean appearance and plenty of rich intensity. The bouquet delivers a very clear and precise cassis tone, with softer cherry and blackberry at the edges. This structured wine offers more volume and depth than most wines made in the village of Barolo, and this is one of the special attributes of the Sarmassa vineyard. I would recommend aging this wine a little longer than the others. "

Pronounced cardamon note at the stunningly vibrant finish, which doesn’t want to stop! From vineyards that are 30-plus years old. From organically grown grapes with Fair'n Green certification. Drink or hold. The 2021 Riesling Trocken Vulkangestein offers a clear and flinty bouquet of ripe and juicy white and yellow-fleshed peaches, apricots and mirabelles intertwined with flinty notes of crushed rocks. Round and lush but still fresh and piquant, this is a generous but elegant, refined and all-in-all coolish Riesling with ripe yet not all-too-ripe stone fruit aromas and crunchy fruit whose juice is perfectly interwoven with the mineral sound of music.

Some attractive spicy oak here, too. The mid-weight palate has a very composed and linear shape with a long, succulent and regal finish. Great polish and balance here; the structure is superb. Try from 2022. Ripe and spicy, this wine comes from an estate on the western edge of Pauillac. Young fruit, toast and fine tannins are combining well into a rich wine that is likely to develop relatively quickly, very much in the style of this property. Drink from 2024. Located in Pauillac, Château Batailley has made a beautiful 2015, but it’s going to need time to integrate its oak. Made from primarily Cabernet Sauvignon mixed with 20% Merlot and just a splash of Petit Verdot, it gives up lots of red currants, coffee, and cedary, woody spice characteristics as well as a meaty undercurrent. Medium to full-bodied, ripe and polished on the palate, with ripe, yet present tannin, give bottle 4-5 years and enjoy over the following two decades or more. Tasted once. A showy mint note leads off, followed by a flash of ganache before giving way to a core of steeped black currant and fig fruit. A strong charcoal edge through the finish gives this texture and length, while a bay leaf note adds freshness. There's lots to like in this old-school version. Best from 2022 through 2033. "

It fermented in concrete and matured in oak barrels (90% of them third use and the rest new and larger, 500-liter ones) for some 30 months, hence the later release date. Somehow, I saw less oak here than in previous vintages, and even less than the 2014 Field Blend that I tasted next to it. The palate is medium-bodied, with a creamy texture, fine-grained tannins and a good finish. A juicy and layered red with soft and chewy tannins, dark fruit and a floral finish. Full and flavorful. A blend of cab franc, malbec, cab sauvignon and syrah. A muscular style, with well-framed flavors of raspberry, red currant and plum that are filled with vibrant acidity.

There’s a slight charred meaty note that’s present but not oak-derived. The palate shows both power and restraint, thanks to fresh acidity; taut, skinsy tannins, and juicy fruit.

It's medium-bodied, supple and smooth in texture, with a mouthwatering finish. It's not a big, burly offering, as this wine was sometimes in the past, but a pleasantly elegant bottling to drink over the next 5-8 years. A fragrant nose of wild strawberries, sour cherries, fresh herbs, forest floor and spice box. It’s medium-bodied with fresh acidity. Round and creamy with plenty of fruit and a succulent finish. Fresh and clean. Drink or hold. Screw cap. The liquid feels pillow-light yet offers an unctuous coat of cherry preserves, tilled earth, and forest floor. Floral aromas and flavors persist, enhanced by white pepper, cinnamon, red apple, and a hint of mint; with the finish comes a juicy assemblage of sweet earth and tobacco This is a polished, appealing Pinot that opens with lifted aromas of licorice, savory herbs and violets amidst plump plum and berry fruit.

Gushing with juicy boysenberry and tart cranberry notes, this wine—which aged 16 months in (16% new) French oak—is framed by elongated, grippy tannins; cedar spices; and zippy acidity that dissolves into a long, berry- driven finish hinting at cocoa powder and pink peppercorns. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Borreo by Silverado Vineyards Sangiovese is bright and lively. TASTING NOTES: This wine brings beautiful red and black fruit to the fore. Pair it with grilled lamb chops.

The grapes were harvested fully ripe at the end of April, which is the equivalent to the end of October in the northern hemisphere.

This is in the process to be certified organic. It's exuberant, sunny, extrovert and Mediterranean, expressing the southern exposure and the light from the vineyard. It's juicy and tasty. This vintage seems very expressive and reflects the character of the different places quite faithfully. Slightly cloudy, with an intense nose, with plenty of herbal-tea character to the sour cherries, sauerkraut, crushed boysenberries and mulberries. Some muddled, natural complexity here with a decadent, mossy edge and white pepper. Intrinsic and naturally expressive, with lots of tart berries and a leafy edge in the finish. Bold freshness with a certain level of tangy greenness for sure, but it’s serious and fun at the same time, too. Demanding and gimmicky, but shows natural complexity. "

The much earthier medium-bodied flavors possess excellent intensity and a certain taut muscularity on the youthfully austere, focused and relatively powerful finish. This well-made and firmly structured effort is going to require at least some patience. "

A very fine premier cru with pronounced notes of white flowers, crisp acidity, some generous zesty citrus and a hint of stone fruit. Long and classy. "
10029,Flegenheimer Bros Out of the Park Shiraz,2017,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,17,15,3.5,9,"Made in a ripe, fruit-forward style, the 2017 Out of the Park Shiraz is a blueberry pie of wine, soft and yielding, with hints of baking spices to accompany its lush fruit. Digging a bit deeper, it's medium to full-bodied but lacks a bit of substance on the mid-palate and finish. Still, it's a fun, fruity drink for short-term enjoyment. "

This wine manages smooth integration with none of the rougher spots that can sometimes occur in hot and dry growing seasons. The bouquet shows nuanced detail with wild berry, forest floor, grilled herb and wild rose. The wine is firm on the palate with tight stemmy tannins. A fresher 2017 with cherry, mushroom and stone aromas and flavors. Medium body. Firm, lively yet fine-grained tannins. Bright finish. Elegantly structured, this offers balsamic aromas of camphor that mingle with new leather, forest floor and blue flower. The taut, polished palate features mature Marasca cherry, blood orange and star anise before closing on a hint of mocha. Fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink 2024–2029. Round, evoking plum, dried cherry and earth flavors framed by toasty spice accents. This starts out polished before the tightly-wound, refined tannins emerge. Best from 2025. "

This wine, from a clay-based parcel of 0.56ha is bright, perfumed and well balanced, framed by 33% new wood and underpinned by acidity. La Riotte is a premier cru that deserves to be better known. A pretty and even purple colour, with poised clear-cut fruit, a little bit of rhubarb, threads of different coloured fruit. Green, red and then a chocolate richness to finish. Concentrated but dry. This may be going through an awkward patch though as the wine feels as though it should deliver more in time. Bottled with a DIAM 30 organic closure. The 2017 Morey-Saint-Denis La Riotte 1er Cru has a well-defined bouquet of tart red cherries and briary and fern scents, focused and displaying nicely integrated oak, though it loses some of its charm and complexity in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with chewy tannins, peppery red berry fruit and a grippy, saline finish. A little brutish compared to the showing in barrel. Maybe it will manifest more refinement in bottle. Closure is Diam 30 Organic. Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2017 tasting. Best After 2023 "

It fermented in underground pools fully destemmed with indigenous yeasts and matured in 5,000-liter oak foudres and 500-liter oak barrels for 14 months. This is expressive but subtle, faintly balsamic, with good ripeness (14.5%) alcohol, fully developed flavors and hints of Mediterranean herbs, with more pine needles in this north-facing exposition and grainy tannins. In 2019 they played up more of the varietal profile, and it shows in the wine. It has fine-grained, chalky tannins and a long, dry finish.

There's serious grip through the finish. For the cellar.  Very open, spicy and fresh on the nose, you could almost open this now. Struck flint notes assist in teasing out notes of leaf tea, tobacco, rosemary and rose. Very full-bodied, generous but powerful on the palate, tense and mineral. Mouthcoating ripe, sweet tannin and robust amounts of sweet baking spices, along with more tobacco and black fruit on the palate. Has depth, length, power and impressive balance despite the high alcohol. Drink from now into 2022, or from 2031 to 2040. Lieu-dit La Landonne, from the Brune side (mica schist bedrock). Matured in new and one-year-old barrels for 14 months. The 2019 Côte Rôtie La Landonne comes from one of the greatest sites for Syrah in the world, the La Landonne lieu-dit located close to the center of the appellation, on the Côte Brune side. It reveals a deeper purple hue (it's slightly more opaque than the Seigneur de Maugiron) and offers a brilliant nose of ripe cassis, black raspberries, scorched earth, smoked herbs, and seared meat. Full-bodied and powerful on the palate, this is a deep, spicy, concentrated Côte Rôtie with a plush, layered mouthfeel, sweet tannins, beautiful balance, and a great, great finish. This puppy brings the fruit, opulence, and texture of the vintage yet still has a classic Côte Rôtie character. The 2019 Cote Rotie La Landonne features its typical dark, meaty, espresso-like aromas, leavened by hints of raspberry and black cherry. It's full-bodied and concentrated but supple and relatively approachable, with soft, velvety tannins and a long, mouthwatering finish. It's delicious now, but I would not be surprised to see it close up for several years before reemerging into maturity, so catch it now, or hold it another 5+ years. A smooth, modern interpretation of this famed schistous vineyard, Delas’s La Landonne is elegant and concentrated in feel. The firm, ferrous tannins keep the dark fruit close, oak providing the loudest detail at the moment, but the fruit is there, welling up behind the oak, showing itself in the wine’s generous texture. Given time in a decanter, the fruit wins out, expanding with juicy freshness, but this would best be left to mellow in the cellar for a few years before opening. "

Soft red fruit abounds. From 100-year-old Grenache vines, Riggs's 2018 The Magnet Grenache is a dark-fruited, earthier version of the variety than typical for Australia. Loaded with plum and black cherry fruit and hints of clove and allspice, it's full-bodied, silky-textured and generous on the palate, finishing with plush tannins and a faintly herbal note.

It was aged for 16 months in 50% new French oak and comes in at 14.3% alcohol. Though the ""Block 5"" is not on the label any more, this is still sourced from ""the heart of Block 5"" of Kir-Yianni's vineyard, says the winery. There are some rustic Xinomavros in this report, but this adds a lot more flesh and more ripeness to balance the tannins. The tannins, by the way, are still powerful; this is no easy wine. It will need some air or some cellaring to show its best, even if the concentrated mid-palate better soaks up some of the power. The Syrah may be a small minority of the blend, but it does color this and express itself, adding some important nuance. This is very young, very unevolved and very much likely to improve in the cellar, but right now it looks like a great Diaporos. I personally wouldn't want to touch it for another five years, and that might not be enough. That's not to say it is completely unapproachable even now, but it will surely show better, as well as more harmoniously, with development. "

Iron, dried herbs, sweet dried cherry, mint, crushed rocks, white pepper and earthy notes give the Molsino a good deal of aromatic complexity to match its intense, saline-infused minerality. Today, though, the tannins and acids are almost overpowering. Readers will find an old-school, classically austere Gattinara that needs 10-15 years to be at its best. The 2016 is an absolute jewel of a wine. This wine was not produced in 2017, so the next vintage in this mini vertical is the 2016 Gattinara Vigna Molsino. The name ""Molsino"" is a dialect derivative of the Italian word for ""soft,"" and it comes from the pretty contours of the hills that characterize the Gattinara landscape and the warm, lightly windy and sunny microclimate that this specific growing site enjoys. Indeed, the wine offers rich fruit flavors of wild berry and blackcurrant with solid structure and firmness. Pretty notes of pressed violet, earth and iron ore also appear. This Nebbiolo plays a hand similar to Barolo in terms of its inner power and its superior aging potential. "

This is from a year that the winery calls ""one of the most challenging harvests on record,"" due to rainfall around harvest time by table wine standards. The Riesling harvest was a couple of months later, in early January 2022. A strict selection caused lower quantities to be produced, although the winery says with ""high quality."" Indeed, this seems fresh and lively, with a surprisingly perky feel and a juicy finish. It's on the elegant side this year, not necessarily a bad thing, but it still tastes great. It has the freshness to allow it to age well, so there is no rush. I loved the tangy finish. If you must drink it young, you'll get waves of peaches and apricots (leaning more to peach this year), and it will taste great. Best After 2022 "

I love the brilliant bouquet, with bright notes of cherry at the beginning, followed by fragrant flower and lavender. The 2016 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Zac is a very elegant and polished Sangiovese. It's indeed very nice, albeit a bit streamlined in the mouth, calling for a mild lentil soup and freshly baked bread so as not to overpower those delicate floral notes inherent to the Sangiovese grape. Baked plum, vanilla, menthol and fragrant purple-flower aromas shape the alluring nose. Made with organically grown Sangiovese, the densely concentrated palate doles out mature Marasca cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside close-grained tannins that give some grip to the finish.

Marked by scents of black olives, mixed berries and a whiff of asphalt, the 2019 H Syrah shows ample ripeness and suppleness on the palate, an attractive mix of fruity and savory flavors and a long, silky-textured finish. Approachable now, it should continue to drink well for at least 4–5 years. This modern Shiraz opens with a burst of grape jelly, although it steers clear of confection. Bass notes recall graphite, dried herb and spice. The bombastic fruit appears on the palate, but it feels fresh and juicy, with plenty of acidity.

Elegant layers of crumpled red flowers, incense, raspberry and a light hint of dried meat show on the nose of this bottling. Iodine and sanguine elements rise on the palate, where smashed berries, plums, star anise and mace converge into a satisfying sip. The 2018 Grenache Rodney's Vineyard is a terrific value, offering lots of peppery red fruits, herbes de Provence, and spice notes in a medium to full-bodied, pure, elegant package.

Those more ferrous aromas are followed by a pretty hint of blue flower or dried lavender. This is a nicely textured, mid to full-weight Barolo to hold in your cellar. The 21017 Barolo Serra is bright, nervy and full of energy. Readers will find a Serralunga Barolo built more on persistence than heft, not a bad thing for a village where the wines can be quite big. Chalk, white pepper, orange zest and spice give the Serra its characteristic brightness.   This is linear and taut, with a chalky matrix of tannins underneath cherry, strawberry, eucalyptus and tar notes.

TASTING NOTES: This wine is aromatic, vibrant, and lasting. Its aromas and flavors of ripe apple, light cream and earth accents should pair this well with shellfish in a light cream sauce. (Tasted: April 23, 2019, San Francisco, CA) Lime skins, grapefruit, ash, lily, chives and dairy aromas make for a unique and dynamic entry to the nose of this bottling from a vineyard high in the mountains near Chalone. There's a grainy tightness to the palate, where Meyer lemon pith, almond oil and herbal elements battle for attention. The light gold-colored 2016 Coastview Chardonnay, from a site in Monterey County, spent 12 months in neutral barrels followed by 7 months in stainless steel. It has a smoking bouquet of lemon curd, toasted spices, white flowers, and honeyed pineapple, with just a hint of brioche and toastiness.

COMMENTARY: The 2018 Bouchard Père & Fils Savigny-lès-Beaune Premier Cru Les Lavières is bona fide and authentic. TASTING NOTES: This wine packs rustic notes and blue fruits in the aroma and flavors. Enjoy it with a savory, roast leg of lamb. (Tasted: March 3, 2020, San Francisco, CA) Once again moderate wood and menthol influences can be found on the liqueur-like aromas of both red and dark raspberry that are trimmed in subtle earth and spice whiffs. There is very good verve to the well-delineated and lightly stony flavors that exhibit fine length on the firm and youthfully austere finale. This is substantially more structured and at least some patience will be required. "

Tempranillo and Graciano. Best from 2024 "
10316,Langmeil The Freedom 1843 Shiraz,2017,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,169,14.5,0.0,0,"Langmeil's 2017 The Freedom 1843 Shiraz is a more savory vintage than many others, boasting scents of black olives, licorice and espresso against a backdrop of dark fruit. Yet it's full-bodied, concentrated and generous on the palate, avoiding any sense of austerity and finishing long and plush. It should drink well for 15 years or more. Langmeil has always believed the vines were planted in 1843, the first in the Barossa Valley, but there is some dispute about this. The wine was matured in French hogsheads and barriques (44% new) for 24 months. It's an important wine, and a good one, but I wish the alcohol and oak had been lower. From vines planted in 1843, this is a rarity. The aromas of ripe black and red fruit, as well as red plums and orange peel, are framed in subtly spicy notes of earth and chocolate. The palate is so melded and smooth with a very long delivery of rich blackberry flavors. Noble, long tannins here. Drink or hold. "

It's full-bodied with firm, intense tannins. Cedar and ripe brambleberries follow through to dark chocolate on the finish. Very complex. Best ever? Opening to a dark color and rich concentration, the Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Prime Donne (with 6,600 bottles made) shows a lot of fun character. I want to say that the wine is more modern or contemporary in style, but that's not really true. Yes, there's more fruity richness here, but the bouquet is also very vertical in intensity, lifted and bright. There's a fine spot of sweet cheery and tart apple skin. There is no heaviness. The fruit comes from a six-hectare site at a low 225 meters above sea level with medium-rich soils and lots of clay. That richness that I described evidently comes from the site, more than it does the cellar. If you enjoy a softer side to Brunello, you should seek the welcoming comfort of Prime Donne. Violet, underbrush, ripe berry and camphor aromas waft out of the glass on this focused red. It's elegantly structured, featuring juicy morello cherry, cranberry and licorice before a coffee-bean finish. Tightly woven, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity keeps it energized. Best after 2024. Donatella’s all-female project was launched in 1998. Besides the estate’s three winemakers and external consultant, Valérie Lavigne, the Prime Donne bottling calls on the expertise of four other female wine pros, including two Masters of Wine. There is much going on in the 2016 flavour-wise: tea, tobacco, baked fruit and leather pervade throughout. It is quite an extracted Brunello, with gritty tannins that dominate the palate for now. Time will tell how these resolve, but my instinct says enjoy this over the next few years with a grilled steak. "

Drink or hold. The full-bodied 2017 Orphan Bank Shiraz isn't quite as plush and forward as the 2018, but it remains a super Shiraz, boasting expressive notes of roasted meat and ripe boysenberries, wrapped in a gentle wreath of wild herbs. The structure is a bit too acid-dependent this vintage, so drink it over the near term, while the fruit is still youthfully bold. "

The balance between rich apple and kiwi flavors and the edge of minerality is just right. It will be ready from 2023. Organic and biodynamic. Blending five vineyards (and soil types including marl, limestone and sandstone laminae) in Chavignol, Mellot's 2020 Sancerre Satellite offers a pure, elegant, delicately fresh and aromatic bouquet of white stone fruits and crushed stones. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, this is an elegant, dense and lush, finely structured and persistent Sancerre with intense Peruvian cherry and yellow plum aromas. This 2020 is beautifully balanced and less mighty than the corresponding La Moussière. The finish is stimulatingly grippy and reveals a perfectly fine tannin structure as well as ripeness. A gorgeous wine to drink now. 13% stated alcohol. Diam cork. Tasted in January 2022. Best after 2022. Shows beautiful concentration to the flavors of sweet lime, green plum, mirabelle plum and white asparagus, which are cut with a firming beam of acidity. Chalky minerals add depth and detail, and the long finish features a refreshing menthol note. A complete, harmonious and delicious wine. "

Medium body, ultra-fine tannins and a beautiful, delicious finish. Purity and finesse. Drink or hold. The 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon Gravelly Meadow is ample and full in feel. Dark fruit, scorched earth, licorice, chocolate, spice, leather and menthol fill out the layers effortlessly. Somber and brooding, the Gravelly Meadow has a lot going on. It clearly needs time to be at its best. Firm hillside tannins add to a feeling of gravitas. There is real weight and substance here.   Pretty sage and sassafras aromas lead off, followed by a core of gently mulled blackberry and bitter plum flavors. Edgy grip rides underneath on the finish, with black tea and singed alder accents trailing. Shows a smoldering intensity. Best from 2022 through 2038. Through hardly a wine that we would describe as being restrained, Diamond Creek’s potent, youthfully hemmedin Gravelly Meadow bottling is somewhat tighter and slightly grittier at this point than either of its two 2017 mates. It suffers no shortage of very deep and authoritative varietal fruit and teases with nascent complexity, but even more than either, it demands extended cellaring. Six to ten years seem the bare minimum here, and we do not expect this one to start reaching full stride for closer to twelve or fifteen. The Diamond Creek bunch is, as usual, built for the long haul, and, as usual, these are wines that can be cellared with absolute confidence. Medium to deep garnet-purple in color, the 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon Gravelly Meadow sashays out of the glass with opulent scents of crème de cassis, preserved plums and red currant jelly with hints of Chinese five spice, candied violets and beef drippings plus a waft of chocolate mint. Medium to full-bodied, the palate reveals a good concentration of red and black fruit preserves, while the tannins are just a little rugged with a chewy/stewed texture. It is a little hard and charred on the back palate/finish. The blend this year is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot, 5% Malbec and 3% Cabernet Franc. It was aged for 22 months in French oak, 100% new. "
10346,Patrick Piuze Chablis Vaulorent Premier Cru,2019,Chardonnay,France,96,0,0.0,0,"The 2019 Chablis 1er Cru Vaulorent wafts from the glass with aromas of citrus zest, green apple, warm bread and iodine. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and concentrated, it's lively and enveloping, with terrific mid-palate amplitude and a long, saline finish. The fruit comes from the northern sector of Vaulorent, the, source of previous Piuze Vaulorents. It currently shows a rather austere nose and a pale colour, with a touch of reduction. The real wine emerges on the palate as the fruit swells beautifully here with a totally balanced sense of precision. Excellent length. "
10347,Enric Soler Nun Xarel-lo,2019,Xarel-lo,Spain,89,13,0.0,0,"2019 was drier and riper, and the 2019 Nun Vinya Dels Taus has a little more alcohol, 13%, and slightly lower acidity than the 2018 that I tasted next to it. The old vines are from a plot planted in 1945 that Soler works organically and biodynamically, and it delivered a normal crop in 2019. This fermented and matured in French oak barrels until bottling at the end of May after the harvest. The warm and dry year produced a more exuberant wine from these old vines, a wine that is energetic and young, balsamic and minty, with nuances and still in need of time in bottle. It's seamless, velvety and creamy, with ripe flavors and great length. This felt more Mediterranean, developing notes of fennel with time in the glass. 3,220 bottles produced. Best after 2023. "

It’s silky-smooth, almost creamy in feel, with depths of ripe red berries, licorice and sweet inner herbal tones, all energized by vibrant acidity. A coating of fine tannins punctuates the expression well, as this tapers off lightly structured and perfumed. There’s so much balanced pleasure to be found in this blend of 80% Merlot to 20% Sangiovese. However, I recommend another year of cellaring for it to fully blossom. "

It's made from the unusual Swan clone, a California import that dates from the 1800s. Robert Brittan planted three acres of it in 2008 at his estate vineyard. The flavors are unique and persistent, with underlying minerality and lovely texture. One-quarter was aged in new French oak. Shimmering ruby-red. Highly perfumed, smoke-tinged cherry and blackberry scents are complemented by suggestions of candied rose and succulent herbs. Concentrated yet lively bitter cherry, dark berry and spice cake flavors pick up licorice and cola flourishes with aeration.

Spice, mineral and tobacco elements emerge, along with firm, refined tannins, but this is all about the pure fruit. Shows terrific harmony and length. Sangiovese. Best from 2022 through 2040. A creamy, ripe-tannined red with chocolate, berry, light vanilla and cappuccino character and a solid core of fruit and polished tannins. It’s full-bodied and well crafted. Better after 2022, when it will all come together. Here's a nice Sangiovese to serve with an appetizer of wild mushroom pâté spread over slices of freshly baked whole wheat bread. The Poggio Scalette 2017 Il Carbonaione is a sultry and rich wine from a hot vintage. Fruit in 2017 is dark and ripe, but more importantly, the vintage delivers extra concentration and textural fiber because of the lack of rain and moisture for most of the summer. This wine shows lots of rich and concentrated fruit at its core, with lighter touches of baked terracotta, toasted spice and iron ore. You might be surprised by a floral tone of violet and dried lavender that pops up on the close. Owned by renowned oenologist Vittorio Fiore, who purchased the abandoned property in 1991. Il Carbonaione is the estate's oldest vineyard with 90-year-old vines planted on a steep terraced hillside in Ruffoli. Dark cherry, lavender and violet are infused with hints of tar. This is fruit-laden but pure, with an underlying juicy citrus note and velvety tannins. Finishes with sweet baking spice and vanilla. "

It has the freshness of 2016 and a fine thread on the palate with fine-grained tannins. It's serious and austere, nothing sweet or fancy here, with the granite personality. 13,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in December 2018. After José Luís Mateo began recuperating a number of abandoned high-altitude vineyards near his home town of Verín, Alanda Tinto was the first wine he commercialized, in 2000. Today, the parcels, planted between 1942 and 2002, are all certified organic, some growing in slate, others in granite or clay, at elevations rising to 2,300 feet. The grapes are mainly mencía (65 percent), with bastardo (30 percent), garnacha tintorera and doña blanca making up the balance. Mateo ferments Alanda spontaneously and then ages it for 14 months in used French oak barrels, delivering a wine with tart plum and black mushroom umami deliciousness. The flavors seem more focused on bastardo’s bright berry notes than mencía’s darker weight. And three days later, the wine is still bright, all about mountain air. Pretty heavenly with pollo con chorizo empanadas. Shimmering ruby. High-pitched red and blue fruit, floral and baking spice scents show fine definition and a hint of smokiness. Vibrant, mineral- and spice-laced bitter cherry, red currant and boysenberry flavors deepen and turn sweeter through the midpalate. Finishes impressively long and lively, with emphatic spiciness and subtle tannins lending closing grip.  "

Cherry and raspberry aromas are followed by blue flower and pressed violets. Set this bottle aside for medium or long-term drinking.

A lucid, winter warming nose of brambly raspberry and currant fruit, cherry, licorice, cracked pepper and very dark chocolate is etched in charred, dusty vanillin oak. The oak is increasingly present on the palate, too, as it warms in the glass. Chiseled, chalky tannins cinch plump fruit and savory spice. The finish is sappy and astringent. Another year or two in the bottle (from 2024) might do this good. "

Its floral and light strawberry flavors are very compelling. Drink now. With its crisp texture and tangy, mineral character, this vintage wine is tense, balanced and shows great potential. Still young it needs time for its red-apple flavors to meld with the red currants and acidity. The promise is there and this will be a great Champagne from 2023. This seamless rosé Champagne shows lovely vibrancy, with delicate flavors of white cherry, toast point, pink grapefruit pith and graphite-laced mineral enmeshed in the sleek acidity and finely detailed mousse. Drink now through 2034. A fine and fruity Champagne with a scented nose of strawberry, raspberry, pastry, spring flowers and pomegranate.

The 2016 Rosso del Conte lifts up with an intense and heady bouquet of sweet herbs and tobacco, which deepens as notes of exotic spice, medicinal cherry and hints of menthol form in the glass. It’s silky in texture, delivering a stunning mix of tart wild berries, salty minerals and sage that creates a pleasantly savory expression, as tannins slowly saturate toward the close. This tapers off structured and dry, nearly masking notes of blackberry and cacao that echo on through the finale. A towering and powerful vintage for Rosso del Conte, combining 53% Nero d’Avola and 47% Perricone, that will require cellaring to show its best. "

The 2020 Polígonos San Pablo Verdejo is fresh and floral, fermented and aged in concrete and with an austere and serious profile not easy to find in its place of origin.

The palate is balanced with quite saturated tannins, fine acidity, a smooth texture and attractive red cherry and orange zest flavors, plus a touch of allspice on the finish.

Medium-bodied with fine tannins that give the wine a creamy texture and subtle, focused fruit on the finish. Will age well in a elegant way. The 2019 Pinot Noir Fiddlestix Vineyard is another powerful, brooding wine in this range. Dark cherry, graphite, leather, cloves and menthol build in a Pinot defined by its textural intensity and muscular drive. A wine of resonance and breadth, the 2019 is absolutely stellar in this tasting, not to mention incredibly distinctive. Ripe and solidly built but still comes off as lithe and beguiling, featuring a core of gently steeped red and black cherry fruit flavors, which unwind slowly as bergamot, rose water and wood spice notes swirl through.

It is a fleshy, moderately full-bodied, neatly balanced wine whose fruit and spice flavors stay in very fine focus from front to back, and, if a rather classy look at the variety that very easy to like now, it teases with suggestions of more complexity to come and is well worth setting aside for several more years.

and boysenberry reduction coursing through, carried by a velvety structure
that lets this flow wonderfully. Flashes of apple wood and tar score the
finish, which ends with authoritative cut. This is serious. Best from 2035
through 2055. The wine is packed with glorious black fruits that have immense backing tannins. It has a succulent edge of juicy acidity that sears the tannins and promises a great future. Drink from 2031. The 2017 Vintage Port is a blend of 35% Touriga Nacional, 47% Touriga Franca and various others, including a blend from old vines. It comes in with 113 grams of residual sugar. It was bottled about a month before this tasting, but the just-bottled sample was not really ready. This is a pre-bottling sample instead.

One of the more aromatic ports here, this is laced with cistus and eucalyptus. Lush in texture and concentrated, it was actually showing well at the time of this tasting—notwithstanding some power and pop. The more it aired out, though, the more power it showed. Even so, this remains a rather refined and suave Graham's. I'd call it subtly sexy. It does put on weight with some aeration, though, and there is that muscle underneath, so don't dive in too soon. There were 5,250 cases produced.

Range:95-97 This has the plump sweetness of a Graham’s vintage, teeming with black fruit and saturated with tannins as chewy as the thick black skins of blueberries. Underneath the smoky oak tannins, there’s a gentle rose scent that hints at the wine’s development ahead.

It's dry (four grams of sugar, with 9.2 grams of total acidity) and comes in at 12.5% alcohol. This drinks well, perhaps thanks to having that extra year of bottle aging. The acidity, though evident, is well integrated and countered by the fruit. There's plenty of power, but it is never shrill. The juicy finish is also filled with fruit.

The blend of grapes is 70% Covina, 20% Rondinella and 10% Molinara (a special proprietary clone is used). This is a dark and almost impenetrable wine from a hot and dry vintage.

Even though the soils are poor and very mineral, they are slightly deeper and have a bit more topsoil, and the wines tend to have a little more volume and are less austere on the palate. None of these wines are very fruit-driven. They tend to be subtle and austere, with shy aromas that need time to develop, and they possibly will have a long, positive evolution in bottle.

Concentrated but distinctly lithe in character, with a strikingly long, focused finish that features sneaky tannins and reverberating floral and spice notes. Mark Vlossak draws from windswept and shallow-soiled blocks at Temperance Hill, where the plantings date to 1984. This bottling is slow to rouse, earthbound and tobacco-scented. The fruit takes on a balsamic tone after a day of air, while the turf and cherry flavors feel balanced against each other, the warmth of the vintage translating to generous fruit and ripe but firm tannins. Bright and vivid aromas of pure strawberries and cherries with hints of fresh flowers. Medium to full body with firm, chewy tannins and a solid finish. Smoky undertone. Drink after 2023. Truffle and earth flavors abound here, with purple fruits in the background. The wine is full and round with ample acidity. Roughly one-fifth of the barrels were new. "

An opulent wave of velvety textures floods the entire palate with ripe red and black fruits, leaving a saturation of minerals and grippy tannins in its wake. This is potent, long and structured; yet the balance is on point, as notes of hard red candies and hints of licorice fade. The 2016 Trefiano is quite a wine. This is a blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Caniolo that spends eighteen months refining in medium-toast tonneaux, half new and half second pass. Sangiovese with Cabernet Sauvignon and Canaiolo make up the Tenuta di Capezzana 2016 Carmignano Riserva Trefiano. This expression shows poise and balance with dark fruit, leather, spice and tobacco. Fruit from a classic vintage has shaped a wine with classic lines. The blended reds of Carmignano offer distinctive richness and dark fruit intensity. This wine faithfully mirrors that sense of place. Dusty mineral notes appear on the close. A pretty pumped-up Carmignano with lots of ripe fruit and new wood, yet there’s underlying seriousness to the full body and intensity with a long, flavorful finish. Needs a year or two still to come together. Drink after 2022. The juicy black cherry and raspberry fruit is complemented by notes of wild herbs, iron and tobacco in this energetic red. Allied to a firm, dry structure, this finds equilibrium as the long finish plays out. Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Canaiolo. Drink now through 2033. "

The 2019 Garnacha CDVIN is 100% Garnacha from a single vineyard planted in 1923. It has an interesting bouquet of cherry, mulberry, and plum-like fruits as well as spring flowers, toasted spices, chalky minerality, and just a hint of iron. All about finesse and elegance on the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, has a supple, elegant mouthfeel, great tannins, and a great finish. The balance and texture here are truly something, and this is straight-up gorgeous Garnacha. It needs a decant if drinking any time soon and should evolve gracefully for 10-15 years. Best After 2022 Eduardo Eguren makes this wine from a parcel of 100-year-old vines in the hills of Alto Najerilla. Tasted blind, the wine brings to mind forest strawberries, the warmth of its alcohol cooled, as if by a woodland breeze. The fruit’s purity is impressive, as is its freshness—two of the best kinds of ambition for garnacha. There is a new village Garnacha from Cordovín, but because his winery is in San Vicente de la Sonsierra, he cannot use the name the village of Cordovín. So, he has resorted to labeling it as 2019 Garnacha CDVIN, an absurd last resort due to an absurd limitation in the regulations that I hope will be fixed sooner rather than later. It's produced with grapes from centenary vines in Cordovín and Baldarán on red silt and clay soils with alabaster and gypsum, fermented destemmed and matured in 500-liter barrels for 14 months. It's darker and riper than the 2020 I tasted next to it, with black rather than red fruit, 14% alcohol and a round and juicy palate where the tannins are fine and the finish fresh and long. Best After 2022 "

Lots of black fruits, salted meats, and cured black olives define the bouquet, and it’s full-bodied, concentrated, and structured on the palate.

The 2017 Chianti Classico Riserva is laced with cinnamon, blood orange, wild cherry, tobacco and incense, all of which give it a decidedly exotic flair.

Aged for 24 months in tonneaux, the 2016 Chianti Classico Riserva shows a very smooth and velvety quality of fruit. Lots of brooding black fruits are expertly woven into spice and savory notes of leather and moist earth. The wine shows medium intensity and build in the mouth. It's great for a Sunday pot roast.

10679,Spottswoode Cabernet Sauvignon (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,519,13.9,0.0,0,"The gorgeous 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon is already drinking beautifully, with incredible waves of black cherry and cassis fruit that have completely absorbed the roughly two-thirds new oak. On this occasion, the wine came across as rather forward and supple, with lush tannins framing ample fruit on the medium to full-bodied palate. Impeccably balanced, with tremendous length on the cool, refreshing finish, it manages to showcase the warmth and generous nature of the site and vintage without going over the top. Best After 2022 The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon is another incredible wine from this reference point estate in the Valley. Based on 89.5% Cabernet Sauvignon, 6.5 % Cabernet Franc, and the balance Petit Verdot that was raised in 65% new French oak, it has that classic Spottswoode refinement and elegance as well as medium to full-bodied aromas and flavors of cassis, tobacco, sandalwood, and flowers. I don’t think this hits the heights of the 2013 or 2016, but it shines for its flawless balance, remarkable purity, and great finish. It’s going to have 30 years of prime drinking. There were 4,184 cases produced, and readers will love to have this in their cellar. Ripe blackberries, blackcurrants, cocoa powder, dried thyme and walnut husk on the nose. It’s full-bodied, chewy and compact with firm tannins and a broad, muscular palate. Structured, polished and well balanced. From biodynamically grown grapes. Try after 2024. A bright, effusive wine, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Estate is all finesse. Bright aromatics, vibrant red berry fruit and mid-weight structure give the 2019 its charming, sensual personality. I am surprised to see how open the 2019 is at this stage. I imagine it might close down a bit post-bottling, but the 2019 has superb balance to go with a real feeling of openness, at least today. Red/purplish berry fruit, rose petal, lavender and sweet spice shape the inviting finish. "

Alongside it sits chocolate and dried herbal notes and a dusty earth quality that evokes the dry, sunbaked South Aussie soils. The palate is a little less cohesive. While the fruit is tangy and the warm, dusty earth character evocative, the oak is a little overpowering, weighing things down somewhat. Nevertheless, this is a solid wine from a historic winery. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Brothers in Arms No. 6 Cabernet Sauvignon offers attractive richness and length on the palate.

Inky blue/purplish fruit, lavender, spice, menthol and licorice are front and center. Dried herbs and a kick of black pepper add an exotic flair to the finish. This mid-weight, fleshy Mourvèdre is a real charmer. Best of all, it should drink well with minimal cellaring. The Mourvèdre is one of the highlights in this range from Mike Officer and Carlisle. "

The palate comes in with textured freshness and spry tannins that still give a little crunch. Freshness gives this a vivacious, crunchy midpalate.

This is juicy, linear and lively. 100% sangiovese. Delicious now, but can hold, too. The 2019 Cavaliere is a pure expression of Sangiovese that raises the Bolgheri banner high but does not quite live up to the complexity or depth of other expressions of the same grape from further inland in central Italy. This wine shows baked cherry and even a hint of sun-dried tomato with scorched earth and easy spice. The mouthfeel is simple and bright with complexity and some mild tea bag-like bitter flavors on the close. It is fermented in large oak casks and ages in cement for 18 months.  "

It's produced with a very soft vinification in 2,000-liter oak vats and new barriques. It was bottled after 15 months in oak. This is a powerful vintage; the wine has clout, power and concentration and a little more rusticity (the textbook tree bark!) than the 2017 that I tasted together with this one. There are some dusty tannins and an earthy, chalky sensation on the palate. The 2017 feels more precise than this, but the only problem with this is showing it next to the 2017... 5,500 bottles were filled in May 2018. "

Unwinding in the glass with scents of white flowers, crisp green apple and oyster shell, it's medium to full-bodied, chalky and nicely concentrated, with lively acids and a long, saline finish. A pungent nose consists of sulfur and wood at present though there is good freshness to the full-bodied, opulent and vibrant medium-bodied flavors where citrus-tinged acidity adds lift to the sneaky long, complex and balanced finish. While the nose needs to clean up, it shouldn't be an issue beyond 6 months or so. "
10704,Lamadrid Gran Reserva Malbec,2016,Malbec,Argentina,29,14.2,4.2,6,"Lavender, plum, blueberry, tobacco and licorice on the nose. It’s medium-bodied with silky tannins and a juicy palate. Still fresh and fruity. Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are touched by creamy oak, while this is solid and energetic on a palate that doesn't run deep. Black-fruit flavors feature integrated oak, while this is steady and solid on the finish, but with minimal depth. Considering the difficulties of the 2016 vintage in Mendoza, this is a winner. "

Crushed red berry fruit, spice, rose petal and a touch of new oak lend energy. Courtship is a very beautiful second wine, although that definition does not really do it full justice. "

Inky purple in color, with a brilliant perfume of raspberries, cassis, spring flowers, scorched earth, and graphite, it hits the palate with medium-bodied richness, a terrific sense of elegance and purity, ripe yet present tannins, and a great finish. It's going to benefit from 3-5 years of bottle age and shine for two decades. This is soft and round with juicy fruit. Blackberry, stone and gunflint. Full-bodied with firm tannins and an intense finish. Opens at the end with savory character. Green olives. Drinkable now, but better in 2025. Still based on Bill Smith's original block from the 1970s, plus some additional plantings, the 2019 Cabernet Franc Howell Mountain is 100% Cabernet Franc. Gentle florals and herbal notes of bay leaf and sage appear on the nose, adding savory complexity to the black cherries and red raspberries. Medium to full-bodied, silky, fine and elegant, this is a perennial favorite, drinkable on release and for a decade or more afterward. "

The 2018 J.F.R. Shiraz is sourced from three distinct subregions of McLaren Vale and was aged in a mix of French and American oak, about 35% new. Full-bodied and plush, it's a lovely amalgam of cedar, vanilla and mixed berries—supple and rich, concentrated and flavorful, balanced and long. In short, it's a terrific wine that should drink well for more than a decade. Plenty of rich red to dark berries on the nose with chocolate and vanilla, too.

Medium-bodied, silky and intense in the mouth, it walks a lovely line between savory fruit, citrus and mineral character, with a great line of tangy acidity and a long, energetic finish. This is wonderful! Succulent flavors of red peach, Gala apple and dried mango are loaded with exotic spicy notes. Plush midpalate, with a creamy finish that offers accents of dried tarragon. There are 230 cases of the 2017 Chardonnay Spear Gnesa, which spent 10 months on lees in neutral oak. It offers a more tropical style in its buttered lemon, caramelized pineapple, white flowers, and minty aromas and flavors. Rounded, textured, and fleshy on the palate, it has plenty of richness and depth as well as purity and freshness. It’s another high-quality Chardonnay that will drink well for 4-5 years. White flowers meet with wet wool on the fresh nose of this bottling from an own-rooted vineyard planted to the Clone 3 of Chardonnay.

Brought up in equal parts used barrels, new French oak, and demi-muids, it hits the palate with full-bodied richness, a seamless, incredibly elegant texture, ripe tannins, and one hell of a great finish. This is a Grenache lover's dream, and it should continue drinking brilliantly for another 10-15 years. A strapping young wine, brimming with dark plum paste and boysenberry compote flavors that are carried by racy licorice snap and fruitcake notes. The lively back end shows a hint of bramble and a touch of tar, giving this energy and power as it courses through the finish. Best from 2023. Better balanced than the Renaissance, not so much oak with the natural power of the fruit to the fore. It's very ripe, quite muscular and towards sweet in profile. A bright, zingy, technicolour style, polished and sleek, but will have plenty of fans. Warming alcohol. 100% old-vine Grenache from the lieu-dit Cristia sandy soils.

Coming from the grand cru village of Bouzy, with its reputation for powerful Pinot Noir, this Champagne has something of that concentration, but balances that with elegance, freshness and plenty of crisp acidity. Its fruitiness, laced with minerality, makes for a wine that is ready to drink. Disgorged in September 2019, Barnaut's NV Brut Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru reveals aromas of smoky pear, waxy citrus rind and toasted bread.

Over three years on the lees, it develops a fragrant raspberry scent and toasty richness, with light, buttery notes of brioche. The flavors become beautifully integrated as they open with air. It’s a dinner wine for roast pork with caramelized apples. Based on the 2018 vintage and disgorged in April 2021, the latest release of Orban's NV Extra-Brut is showing nicely, bursting with aromas of pear, white currants, fresh mint and yellow plums.

This wine marks a 20th anniversary since the first vintage was produced in 1999. The Il Borro 2018 Il Borro is 50% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Syrah. Previous vintages also had some Petit Verdot, but that variety was removed because it left too strong a mark in a changing climate. The vines were also converted over to guyot for the same reasons. The wine shows the mint and spice of Merlot and Syrah, respectively, and the structure of Cabernet Sauvignon.  A supple, almost opulent red, with a core of ripe raspberry and kirsch.

This has very nice intensity, and it's fresh, pure, highly elegant and even mineral on the palate. It's a juicy and perfectly round Scheurebe with a long, tropical-flavored finish that reflects mangoes and the macerated skins. Made in a very fine, elegant and reductive style, the wine is almost filigreed and stimulatingly salty. Sourced in the lower third of the Kronberg where the soil is deeper, this is surely a winner of the 2018 vintage. Lemon, lime, and grapefruit with notes of hazelnuts on the palate.

At the more alcoholic end of the spectrum. Fine bright deep purple. Plenty of energy here. Classical for Vaucrains with the extra purity and precision of this vineyard. Picked at a very good moment, with depth and grip, some dark fruit notes stopping just short of chocolate. Immaculate length. Sensual but structured.

Concentrated, with tight-fisted tannins, the palate artfully expresses flavors of espresso, dried violets, and blackberry; it’s meaty, with a lush middle and end A pure note of black currant is accented by delicate hints of bay leaf, dark chocolate, rosehip and iron in this fresh, medium- to full-bodied red. This leans towards Old World in style, with taut tannins providing good tension and definition, firming the well-spiced finish. Drink now. The 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon has a more detailed and classier bouquet than the Merlot, offering blackberry and raspberry coulis; touches of rose petal develop with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with grainy tannins. Good structure here, and just a little austerity toward the finish that keeps you coming back for more. "

The sforzato, or appassimento, process brings on extra heft and intensity for sure, but the Nebbiolo grape never loses its inner grace and poise. Aromas of dried rose, wild cherry, plum and sweet earth rise from the bouquet. A pretty layer of cured tobacco gives the wine a more fleshed-out feel on the close. "

Tension on the palate drives through the wine, with a tightly wound core of fruit around it, including lemon curd, chalk. and a hint of tropicality in the papaya realm. Drink over the next 20 or so years. Best after 2022. Disgorged in October 2018, Billiot's newly released 2013 Brut Millésimé Ambonnay Grand Cru bursts with an expressive bouquet of mandarin oil, musky peach, spices and clear honey that's a touch more exotic in profile this year, reflecting the late harvest. Medium to full-bodied, taut and incisive, the vintage's elevated acids and the producer's non-malolactic style make for a decidedly chiseled, tightly wound wine that verges on the austere despite all its aromatic range.

An element of wild herbs graces the black currant and black cherry flavors in this robust red, which is firm and compact on the iron- and tobacco-tinged finish, with a sense of grace. Needs time to absorb the tannins. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Sangiovese. Best from 2024 through 2040. The Argiano 2018 Solengo is a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 20% Merlot and 5% Sangiovese that flaunts the richness, dark concentration and spicy flavors of a full-throttle Tuscan blend, or the kind of wine that is universally attractive to lovers of hearty red wines for a steak-and-potato kind of night. Solengo's black fruit richness is backed by lots of oak spice and toast. With 60% new French oak (and 40% second-year barrique) for 18 months, this wine embraces a contemporary feel with tight tannins (both from the fruit and the oak) and a rich, long finish. I recommend putting this wine aside for a few more years to let that tannic bitterness subside. Best after 2024. "

It fermented with indigenous yeasts in stainless steel and oak vats and matured in barrel for 21 months. It combines youth with development, power with elegance and comes through as clean and defined, with a medium to full-bodied palate, focused flavors and a dry but lively finish. "
10815,Raventos i Blanc Manuel Raventos,2014,Vintage Sparkling Wine,Spain,109,0,0.0,0,"The toastier 2014 Manuel Raventós Negra comes from a warm and generous vintage, similar to 2019. The wine is a selection of 60% Sumoll and 40% Xarel.lo, and it had at least 70 months in bottle with lees after refermenting. This is a little more classical, more the old style, a little more oxidative with hints of caramel and honey, toasted cereals too.  "

10818,Marchesi di Barolo Barolo Cannubi,2016,Nebbiolo,Italy,129,14.5,0.0,0,"A pure, intense and linear red, this exudes cherry, raspberry, rose, hay and white pepper aromas and flavors. Offers plenty of finesse but also a firm spine of tannins, which bode well for future development. Features fine harmony and a long fruity, minerally and savory aftertaste. Best from 2025 Really perfumed with sliced-strawberry, floral and cedar character that is aromatic and prevailing. Some white truffles, too. Medium-to full-bodied with succulent fruit and tannins. So elegant and refined with a long core of fruit. Try after 2022, but already a beauty. The 2016 Barolo Cannubi is characterized by chalky mineral notes that give the wine a sense of place. This wine features fruit from a southeast-facing parcel in Cannubi composed of loose, calcareous soils that tend to produce early-ripening fruit and nicely concentrated flavors. Elegant mineral tones are also part of the Cannubi package. The mouthfeel here is silky and tightly knit. Aromas of red berry, wild herb and camphor lead the way. On the linear medium-bodied palate, dusty tannins accompany sour cherry, pomegranate and licorice. Drink through 2028. "
10819,Catena La Marchigiana Criolla Chica,2020,Rosé,Argentina,25,13,0.0,0,"Pale salmon-colored rosé with aromas of cherry, peach, lemon zest and hints of spice. Bubble gum, too. It’s medium-bodied with crisp acidity. Dry, fresh and focused. The 2020 La Marchigiana Criolla Chica is a rosé produced with Criolla grapes, and it has a nose and palate that make me think more of a white wine than a pale red. The grape is mentioned as a traditional pink grape on the label, and the wine is subtle and elegant with floral notes, perfumed and fresh, without the rusticity and tannins often associated with Criolla grapes. "
10820,Rebholz Pfalz Pinot Noir R,2019,Pinot Noir,Germany,59,13,0.0,0,"This German pinot noir is conventionally beautiful, in the best sense of those words. Deep and dark with lovely black-cherry, bitter-chocolate and vanilla notes, this is simultaneously rich, well-structured and beautifully balanced. Very impressive depth at the long, velvety finish. "
10821,Jax Vineyards Dutton Ranch Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,39,14.2,0.0,0,"Focused acidity keeps the richness of this wine in check, keeping a balanced freshness that appeals. Apple, pineapple and high-toned citrus combine around hints of baking spice, vanilla bean and nuanced oak. "
10822,Patrick Piuze Chablis Les Clos Grand Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,169,12.5,0.0,0,"The 2020 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos is a deep and powerful wine, evocative of orange oil, ripe pear, white flowers, freshly baked bread and nutmeg. Full-bodied, layered and muscular, it's broad-shouldered and concentrated, with lively acids and a long, mandarin-inflected finish. Rich, featuring peach, melon, earth and stone flavors. Shows an underlying steeliness, despite the generous profile, with fine balance and length. "

10824,St. Innocent Momtazi Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,Oregon,50,13.5,0.0,0,"This feels loose and light in its scent, with a burst of wild strawberry lined with a dusty, wind-blown Van Duzer accent. The flavors go deeper, toward dark cherry and a hint of cinnamon, with a cherry-skin grip. For plank roasted salmon. Shows expression and elegant dimension, with savory plum and blueberry flavors laced with crushed stone and forest floor accents that build richness toward medium-grained tannins. "
10825,Col d'Orcia Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,56,14.5,4.0,12,"Made with certified organic fruit, the Col d'Orcia 2017 Brunello di Montalcino definitely shows some of the heat of the vintage, and I think this impression is reinforced by the location of this property on the southern side of the appellation, where temperatures are normally a few degrees higher on average. The winemaking team at this historic estate is not deterred by hot vintages, and their winemaking protocol captures the freshness and brightness of Sangiovese nonetheless. In fact, the alcohol content here measured 14.5%, which is almost contained, compared to some other wines in this report from cooler subzones. A learned comfort with organic farming is key to this wine's detailed aromas of black cherry, crushed rose and Mediterranean herb. Best after 2024. This red offers plenty of cherry, strawberry, wild thyme and sage flavors. Starts out on the elegant side, before chewy tannins kick in and show a more robust character. Balanced and long, with tobacco and earth accents on the finish. Best from 2025. Subtle aromas of underbrush, new leather, tobacco and camphor waft out of the glass. Tightly knit and full-bodied, the palate features dried cherry, star anise and ground clove framed in rather assertive, close-grained tannins. Best After 2024 "
10826,Joseph Drouhin Vosne-Romanee Les Petits Monts Premier Cru,2020,Pinot Noir,France,499,0,0.0,0,"A high-toned red cherry and rose petal nose, and a silky, exquisite texture with lovely length. 'It has everything to become grand, grand, grand vin,' says Drouhin. Tasting this wine, Frédéric Drouhin related the saying of Henri Jayer: ‘From Les Petits Monts, the world is at your feet’. "
10827,Roger Sabon Chateauneuf-du-Pape Le Secret des Sabon,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,219,15,0.0,0,"Last of the wines from bottle, the 2020 Châteauneuf Du Pape Le Secret Des Sabon is a field blend of mostly Grenache that sees a touch of stem inclusion and aging all in oak tronconique tanks. A candidate for the wine of the vintage, it has a similar bouquet to the Prestige and has beautiful red and black fruits (even some blue fruits), flowers, garrigue, and spice. This carries to a full-bodied 2020 with a layered, seamless mouthfeel, moderate acidity, no hard edges, and a great, great finish. Full-bodied and powerful, but not over the top and with a great sense of freshness. It's expansive, with gently sweet, vibrant black cherry and kirsch notes within soft, pliable fruit tannins and a long finish. A remarkably precise and balanced wine, not the most powerful this year, but one of the most drinkable. Mostly grown on sand, fermented in stainless steel then aged in tronconic wooden vats. Exuberant blackberry and boysenberry flood the palate in this lush, polished red. Shows impressive density, and though ripe and decadent, this has a refreshing beam of iron and menthol notes that bring balance. Offers baked cherry pie, fruitcake and salty black licorice accents that add interesting detail through the powerful, nicely framed finish. Drink now. "
10828,Ernest Vineyards The Wrangler Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,California,62,12.01,0.0,0,"This has brambly, rich and ripe red-cherry aromas with a fresh strawberry edge that really pops. The palate is sappy and carries plenty of brightly lit berry flavor. Nicely defined tannins. Drink or hold. "

10830,Ettore Germano Barolo Cerretta,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,79,14.5,0.0,0,"Bright and charming, this strawberry- and cherry-flavored red is light on its feet and mouthwatering, with accents of tar and tobacco adding interest. No pushover, this packs some lively tannins, ending with fine balance and length overall. The Ettore Germano 2017 Barolo Cerretta shows a shiny ruby color and lots of ambient light. The bouquet is nuanced and detailed, with cassis, dried cranberry, camphor ash and crushed flowers. This wine excels in terms of texture, thanks to that twofold combination of structure and elegant silkiness. This is a sharply chiseled and focused Cerretta release of some 75,000 bottles. "
10831,Domaine du Vieux Telegraphe Chateauneuf-du-Pape La Crau (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,209,14.5,0.0,0,"If anyone tells you that Châteauneuf is just a big red that’s never elegant, then they need to taste this masterpiece of elegance. So many spicy and savory nuances on the very concentrated but almost perfectly proportioned palate. This is both joyful and serious at the very long, focused finish. Decades of aging potential! Drink or hold. Saturated ruby. Deep-pitched red/blue fruit liqueur aromas pick up suggestions of licorice, pipe tobacco and pungent flowers and herbs with air. In a lush, weighty style, offering expansive black raspberry, cherry cola, singed plum and fruitcake flavors sharpened by a jolt of spiciness on the back half. For all this wine's richness, it's energetic as well, showing solid, spice- and floral-driven persistence on the finish, which is framed by velvety, even tannins.  The 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape is ruby/purple-hued and has the classic translucent color of the domaine. It's more precise and focused than the Télégramme and will need more time, but it offers a complex, gorgeous bouquet of red and black fruits, crushed stone, wild fennel, and ground pepper. Pure, medium to full-bodied, and elegant, do your best to hide bottles for 5-7 years and it's going to keep for two decades. "
