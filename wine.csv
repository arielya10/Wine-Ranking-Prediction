0,Dom Perignon Vintage with Gift Box,2012,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,269,12,4.8,49,"What a magnificent bouquet for this Dom Pérignon 2012! Pastry, a hint of smoke and autolytic notes provide a compelling counterpart to eager yet elegant aromas of citrus (lime, tangerine and kumquat) joined by those of fresh fruit, herbs, liquorice, and menthol. There is even a refreshing note of ivy. The palate is tense, vibrant, and very fresh despite its impressive density, which meets its match with an unending finish. This 2012 incarnates the very essence of Dom Pérignon with such a concentrated degree of intensity, along with a capacity for ageing, that it is surely destined for a second life in a P2 edition. Wonderful elegance and balance to this Dom Pérignon with cooked apple, lemon and hints of white pepper and salt. It’s medium-bodied with really fine bubbles and balance. Spicy at the end. So wonderfully fresh, linear and long. Racy and elegant. A DP that invites to drink right now. All about finesse. Tension, too, with precise phenolics and bright acidity on the back palate. Subtle energy. Drinkable now, but will develop beautifully in the bottle. This eloquent Champagne has an enticing waft of Mandarin orange on the nose that continues on the palate, which is layered with flavors of crushed blackberry and cassis, toast, chopped almond, graphite and oyster shell. A bright, finely-knit and harmonious version, with a lovely, raw silk-like mousse, and a lasting, expressive finish. Drink now through 2037. The 2012 Dom Pérignon has turned out very well indeed, unwinding in the glass with notes of Anjou pear, smoke, toasted nuts, freshly baked bread and crisp stone fruit. Medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, it's still tightly wound, its incipiently fleshy core of fruit framed by racy acids and chalky grip, complemented by a classy pinpoint mousse. A touch drier and a touch less reductive than the 2008 out of the gates, these two vintages are clearly destined to be compared for some time to come; but at this early stage, my instinct is that the 2012 will have the edge in the long term. "

Owner David Duncan explained that the American oak they use in the wine for aging now comes 100% from their own barrel-making facilities, which tones down the vanilla character in the wine. Really impressive and delicious. It’s a joy to drink now, but can age. COMMENTARY: The 2017 Silver Oak Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon deftly folds ripe fruit and oak into a smooth and delectable experience. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with red and black fruit aromas and a complimentary oak accent. Enjoy it with the first cut from a prime rib. (Tasted: January 20, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "
35,Almaviva,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,Chile,169,15,4.4,11,"The aromas of iodine and blackcurrants with roses and lavender make the wine extremely perfumed. It’s full-bodied with a tight, fine-tannined palate that shows linear flow through the center palate. It’s vertical and integrated, adding depth and serious quality to the wine. "
36,Paul Dolan Vineyards Organically Grown Zinfandel,2019,Zinfandel,California,25,14.5,3.8,256,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Paul Dolan Organic Grapes Mendocino County Zinfandel shows excellent richness and balance.

39,Tormaresca Calafuria Rose,2021,Rosé,Italy,17,12,3.7,29,"The 2021 Rosato Calafuria is airy, fresh and sweetly scented with ripe melon, hints of mango, banana and sweet smoke. This is soft and round in texture, creamy even, with a lively twang of citrus-tinged acidity enlivening its ripe apple fruit and mineral underpinnings. This tapers off long and potent, yet it is incredibly fresh and perfumed. A pure pleasure. The balanced richness of this Negroamaro Rosato leaves a lasting impression. "
40,Golden West Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Washington,20,13.5,3.6,171,"Very attractive aromas of sweet and sour fruit with cherries, strawberries and some orange peel. It’s medium-bodied with fine, firm tannins and a delicious chocolate and coffee undertone to the fruit at the end. 40% whole cluster. Handmade pinot. Coming from the talented team at K Vintners, the 2019 Pinot Noir comes from a mix of clones, spent a full 40 days on stems, and was aged 12 months in 15% new French oak. It reveals a medium ruby hue as well as perfumed cherry and raspberry fruits interwoven with notes of flowery incense, baking spices, and dried forest floor. Medium-bodied, nicely textured, and balanced, it has some firmer tannins (there's 30% stems), a layered, building mouthfeel, and terrific length. A terrific Pinot Noir, it will keep for 4-6 years, and I suspect it will be even better this time next year. "

46,Laurent-Perrier Cuvee,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,France,100,12,4.6,570,"Ethereal floral and raspberry nose. A vinous palate with a mild mousse, the soft texture all wrapped in spice, nuts, smoke and a superior berry tincture. Very long and easy to enjoy. This great rosé combines texture with bright fruit and a bit of age. It is poised between a ripe dosage and a crisp texture, with red fruits and toastiness marking the flavors. It is a fine bottling to enjoy now. Baked cherry and strawberry fruit flavors are ripe and juicy in this bright rosé, underscored by minerally smoke and chalk accents. Hints of candied orange peel, dried thyme and ground ginger play on the fruit range and ride the fine, lively mousse and lingering finish. Drink now. Intensely floral, this wine has a copper-pink color that’s reflected in the coppery and salty edge of its raspberry and mineral depths. It’s ripe, savory and clean, and hard to resist if there are duck rillettes nearby. The NV Champagne La Cuvée Brut Rosé is entirely Pinot Noir from 10 crus in the Montagne de Reims. It is forward in the glass with ripe currants, fresh herbs, and smoky perfume. This continues to the palate, with notes of ripe wild raspberry and tangerine, and it has a medium to full-bodied texture that is pure and lightly savory on the finish. Fantastically paired with beef tartar and other richer raw preparations, this is a wonderful and food-friendly expression.  The latest iteration of Laurent-Perrier's NV Brut Cuvée Rosé is showing brilliantly, bursting from the glass with notes of smoky red berry fruit, apples, blood orange, pomegranate and warm biscuits. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and vinous, with a delicate mousse, good depth at the core and ripe acids, concluding with a sapid, gently phenolic finish. This is a sophisticated, gastronomic rosé that would work well at table. "
47,Dom Perignon Vintage,2012,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,259,12.5,4.5,24,"What a magnificent bouquet for this Dom Pérignon 2012! Pastry, a hint of smoke and autolytic notes provide a compelling counterpart to eager yet elegant aromas of citrus (lime, tangerine and kumquat) joined by those of fresh fruit, herbs, liquorice, and menthol. There is even a refreshing note of ivy. The palate is tense, vibrant, and very fresh despite its impressive density, which meets its match with an unending finish. This 2012 incarnates the very essence of Dom Pérignon with such a concentrated degree of intensity, along with a capacity for ageing, that it is surely destined for a second life in a P2 edition. The 2012 Dom Pérignon is a dense, powerful wine. I am almost shocked by its vinous intensity and raw, unbridled power. The 2012 reminds me of the 2003, but with more finesse and not quite as pushed. Mildew, rain and frost were challenges and resulted in low yields, something that was further compounded by warm, dry weather that concentrated the fruit even more. Those qualities result in a dense Dom Pérignon endowed with real phenolic intensity. It is one of the most reticent young Doms I can remember tasting, I wouldn’t even think of opening a bottle for at least a few years. The 2012 Champagne is 51% Chardonnay and the rest Pinot Noir and has 4 grams per liter dosage. Its style is finessed and elegant, revealing a soft, smoky perfume of fresh white flowers, pear, and fresh bread dough. The palate is focused and long, with a polished mousse, and offers notes of lime blossom, white peach, and chalky minerality as well as long perfume resonating on the finish. Best after 2024. This eloquent Champagne has an enticing waft of Mandarin orange on the nose that continues on the palate, which is layered with flavors of crushed blackberry and cassis, toast, chopped almond, graphite and oyster shell. A bright, finely-knit and harmonious version, with a lovely, raw silk-like mousse, and a lasting, expressive finish. "
48,Joseph Phelps Freestone Vineyards Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,70,14.1,4.3,209,"The 2019 Pinot Noir Freestone Vineyards takes time to open, metamorphosing from iron and woodsmoke to raspberries, dried flowers, dark spices and aniseed. The medium-bodied palate is silky and seamlessly fresh, loaded with perfectly ripe, earth-laced fruits whose flavors linger for a very long time in the mouth. This has the fruit intensity and structure to age very well in bottle. Blueberry and spice with lightly toasted notes and some nuts. Full, yet very tight, with refined tannins and polish. Linear and long. Intense and vivid. A beauty. This needs time to open. Try after 2022. Lastly, the 2019 Pinot Noir Freestone Vineyards reveals a medium ruby, semi-opaque hue to go with stunning notes of ripe black cherries, black tea, spice, and a distinct, racy, reductive, mineral nuance that builds with time in the glass. Beautifully textured, nicely structured, and balanced, it's going to cruise for 5-7 years, if not over a decade, in cold cellars. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Joseph Phelps Freestone Vineyards Pinot Noir is an outstanding wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with attractive aromas and flavors of red fruit, dried leaves, and a hint of mineral notes. Enjoy it with lightly grilled, wild salmon fillets. (Tasted: August 24, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Savory forest-floor tones contrast well against crisp, focused flavors of blood orange, pomegranate and cherry. With length and breadth, it is structured yet expansive, with and immensely delicious palate. Well-knit, with fresh spiciness to raspberry and cherry tart flavors that are flanked by hot stone accents. Finishes with slate notes and plenty of creaminess. Drink now through 2025. "
49,Beaulieu Vineyard Georges de Latour Private Reserve,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,145,14.5,4.4,52,"Blackberry, blackcurrant and mint with some sage and crushed-stone undertones. Full-bodied with chewy tannins that are in-check and nicely polished. Smoke, toasted oak and bark at the end, complementing the fresh yet ripe fruit. Drink after 2024. The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Georges de Latour Private Reserve is fabulous. Inky, rich and explosive, the 2018 is a fine addition to the lineage of one of Napa Valley's most historic wines. Inky red fruit, chocolate, leather and licorice all open in the glass. Aeration brings out floral top notes, raspberry and a hint of blood orange. There is plenty of depth, but the tannins are finer than they were a few years ago. Shorter time on the skins and a reduction in barrel fermentations really allow the pedigree of these Rutherford sites to come through. The 2018 is sensational. Juicy, ripe and inviting, featuring racy cassis, plum and boysenberry compote notes that stretch out over the anise- and applewood-tinged spine. A bit taut in the end, with a cedary edge, but there's ample fruit here to give this some cellaring. Drink now. "

Full-bodied, yet firm, fresh and bright with a creamy, crunchy finish. One of the best values in Napa appellation designated reds. Drink or hold. Lush, with boysenberry, plum and blackberry compote flavors liberally laced with licorice snap and sweet spice accents. Reveals a glimmer of graphite on the finish to keep it honest. For the hedonist crowd. "
52,Moet & Chandon Imperial,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,62,12,4.5,433,"When it comes to finesse, this classic—roughly equal parts Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier with a slightly smaller amount of Chardonnay—doesn’t miss: It’s comme il faut from the unending bead onward. Joined by biscuit and almond aromas, ripe golden apple on the nose turns to green on the palate, where citrus—lime, grapefruit, mandarin orange—cycles through high-flying acidity even as luscious pear adds weight and chalk conveys elegance through the finish.  An elegant version, fine and creamy in texture and backed by lively, orange peel acidity. A streak of smoke-tinged minerality underscores flavors of almond madeleine, poached pear, anise and preserved lemon. Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay. Drink now. Tart red-fruit scents give this a vinous profile, fragrant with cranberry, root vegetables and ginger. It finishes clean, with cool limestone minerality. Cellar this for a year to let the flavors develop further. A hint of smoke wafts through flavors of black currant, lemon-infused pastry cream and crystallized honey in this fresh, well-meshed Champagne, with a touch of Mandarin orange peel and a fine mousse. Toasty biscuit, plush apricot and a hint of zesty lemon peel, the palate is braced with bright lime and soft spice. The lower dosage of this famous brand has produced good balance between the crisply textured white fruits and the light minerality. The Champagne just hints of some bottle age. It is totally ready to drink. This Brut NV is all about textural feel, in a comparable way to velvet and leather apparel. It takes a moment’s aeration in the glass for the discreet citrus, apple-ring and toasty character to emerge, so don’t rush this. The simultaneously mellow and lively balance and the harmoniously dry finish will appeal to a wide public. Drink now. "
53,Lemelson Thea's Selection Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Oregon,34,13.3,4.1,124,"Aromas of ripe red cherry, plum, black tea, and a hint of lavender. Medium-bodied with fine, silky tannins. Bright acidity articulates the red fruit and berries with clarity and drive. Fresh cream at the finish. A total delight. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Lemelson Vineyards Pinot Noir is bright, lively, and crisp on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of red fruit, mineral notes, and spice. Enjoy it with grilled, dill-accented grilled salmon fillets. (Tasted: April 10, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The 2019 Pinot Noir Thea's Selection is rounded with its perfume of incense, fresh herbs, and raspberry liqueur. Medium-bodied and approachable, with fine tannins and notes of black cherry and tea leaf, this is a Pinot Noir with a darker profile but a lot of charm.  "
54,Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame Yayoi Kusama Limited Edition in Gift Box,2012,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,239,12.5,4.7,45,"With a slight preponderance of Pinot Noir in the blend, this wine is rich and impressive. It is still young, with a crisp edge that makes the fruit shine. Apple and citrus flavors are integrated into a mineral vein. Drink from 2022. A generous golden colour betrays the dominance of Pinot Noir in the blend; this theme thereafter maintained by aromatics of fig, wild strawberries and Mirabelle plums; behind that, jasmine, red apples and a distant whiff of woodsmoke. Engaging already, in other words. One’s impressions are confirmed and amplified on the palate, with the aspiration voiced by both chef de caves Dominique and Didier, to allow the ‘cooler’ Pinot Noir sites full rein. This is eloquently evidenced by a subtle and deftly textured structure, the primary fruit notes of nectarine and citrus peel underscored by a richer, still somewhat reticent, core, darker and more savoury of intent and oh, so subtle at the moment. I have every confidence that this characteristic will come into its own over the longer term and mark the 2012 as one of the more successful outings for this outstanding cuvée. Fine and graceful, this dances across the palate with its bright, well-defined freshness and detailed flavors of Mandarin orange, toast point, crème de cassis and minerally oyster shell. Subtle in its intensity, with all the pieces seamlessly knit into an elegant whole. Aromas of lime zest, lemon and brioche follow through to a full body with a round, creamy texture, fine bubbles and a delicious finish. Direct and focused 2012. Lots of elegance and energy in this. Drink or hold. "

The complexity and richness of Special Cuvée is unparalleled among the entry non-vintage blends of every Champagne house, short of ascending to the mesosphere of Krug. Its grand recipe explains why, built on incredible depth of 50%-60% reserves. Triumphant complexity is a given at Bollinger, but it’s the dynamic freshness and vitality that really set it apart as one of the most affordable Champagne benchmarks. This harmonious Champagne is wonderfully vibrant as it dances across the palate, with the satinlike mousse carrying flavors of white cherry, Marcona almond and ground coffee that show accents of candied kumquat, ginger, aromatic verbena and graphite. A streak of racy salinity emerges on mouthwatering finish. Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier. Drink now Lots of biscuit aromas and a wide spectrum of fresh-citrus, candied-citrus, red-apple and red-berry notes. Mouth-filling creaminess, plus quite an imposing presence and powerful structure for an NV Brut. Long, citrus and chalky finish that’s very clean and properly dry. 60% pinot noir, 30% chardonnay, 10% pinot meunier. Almost 20% barrel fermented and 62% reserve wines.  A vinous Champagne, this has pinot-noir depths of flavor, the structure enhanced by barrel-fermented reserve wines. Youthfully blunt in its power, this will benefit from a year in the cellar, when it can settle into its dry mineral savor and hazelnut grace. The NV Champagne Special Cuvée is 60% Pinot Noir, 25% Chardonnay, and a small amount of Meunier, with the base wine coming from the 2018 vintage and 15% from reserve. Light golden in color, the nose is vinous and forward, with ripe and opulent fruit, offering notes of yellow flowers, orange zest, redcurrants, toast, and broth. The palate is ripe with red plum and displays a chalky texture with a fine mousse. Classic and balanced, this is a great entry wine for the range with its balance of power and finesse.

56,Joseph Phelps Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,94,14.5,4.6,52,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Joseph Phelps Cabernet Sauvignon underscores how well this venerable Napa winery has handled this omnipresent grape variety.

Serve it with grilled beef topped with diced shallots and slivered orange and red bell peppers. (Tasted: August 24, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Dark, with a flicker of charcoal weaving amid steeped plum, loganberry, black currant and boysenberry fruit flavors. Features flashes of sweet bay leaf and licorice root that underline the briary finish, which has good energy. Floral cherry and currant flavors burst from this wine’s tannins, which feel chewy, tight-ening around the fruit with their musky and smoky notes. Give it time for the fruit to fully emerge from the tannins, or coax it out with lamb burgers. "

It has an incredible bouquet of cassis, currants, dark chocolate, lead pencil, and tobacco, and while it's unquestionably Napa, it has a regal, structured, almost Bordeaux-like vibe as well. Full-bodied, perfectly balanced, and layered on the palate, with silky tannins, this quintessential Insignia is up with the finest vintages of this cuvée I've tasted and is in the same realm as the 1997 (the first vintage I bought for my personal cellar), 2001, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016. This is richly layered, with cassis, crushed plum and blackberry puree flavors moving through slowly but steadily, while warm earth, ganache and black licorice notes follow along. Picks up a tarry edge on the finish as the fruit takes an encore. For fans of the muscular, fruit-driven style. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc.

This mouthwatering rosé Champagne shows lacy texture and precise balance, with the well-honed acidity deftly knit to the subtle, chalky minerality and delicate range of nectarine, white cherry, slivered almond and pickled ginger notes. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Drink now. Currently based on the 2016 harvest, this is floral and citrussy, showing a lithe, graceful balance. It’s a blend of 40% Chardonnay, 30% Pinot Noir and 30% Meunier, with about 40% of reserve wine, and red wine accounts for 7% of the blend. Its delicate, subtly expansive flavours of raspberry and strawberry are enlivened by a tangerine-like acidity, and while it feels ripe and full in flavour on the palate, it never loses its sense of refinement and poise, finishing with detailed length and depth.

59,Mt. Brave Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,104,14.5,4.3,56,"The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon from Mt. Brave is fabulous. Inky, rich and explosive, the 2018 possesses tremendous depth and tons of personality. Graphite, blue/purplish fruit, blackberry jam, bittersweet chocolate, sage, lavender, menthol give the 2018 tons of character to match its explosive feel. The brooding, backward wine is going to need quite a bit of time to unwind, but boy is it gorgeous. Lots of cassis and black raspberry fruits as well as classic Mount Veeder notes of lavender, violets, bouquet garni, and rocky, mineral-like notes emerge from the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon. A deep, full-bodied mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, it has a plush, layered texture, beautiful tannins, a deep, concentrated mid-palate, and a great finish. Another head-turning wine from this label, it’s a candidate for the best Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon out there at the price point. Blackberry and chili with hints of cloves and graphite. Bitter chocolate, too. Full-bodied, very linear and tight with intense tannins that lead you down the finish. Solid structure. Needs four or five years to open up. Better after 2025. This packs in lots of dense yet sleek blackberry, mulberry and black currant fruit flavors, while anise, sassafras and violet notes add range throughout. There's plenty of structure embedded as well, though it tilts to the zesty, acid-driven side of the ledger, further enlivening the fruit. This has a serious oak treatment, but it's very precise and fine-grained. For the cellar. Best from 2022 through 2038. The winemaking precision of Chris Carpenter as his team is apparent across all their projects regardless of price point, making the Mt. Brave Howell Mountain particularly impressive as a relative value proposition. Soft but ripe red fruits and briar on the nose. Rich, energetic and attractively dry on the finish. Punches above its weight across all metrics of power, complexity, length, and intrigue. 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, 6.5% Cabernet Franc, 3% Merlot, 1.5% Petit Verdot, 1% Malbec. Reductive on the nose, this age-worthy wine shows a ton of structure and elegant power, finessed in tight, youthful tannin and earthy underbrush. Sage, dust and oak support a framework of dense red fruit that should develop further in the cellar. Enjoy best from 2028. "

It’s Burgundian-rich, a pinot noir as a serious Champagne with complexity, muscular structure and vinous length of spicy fruit. Very pinot noir, thanks to all the red-berry and spice aromas, with quite a bold flavor profile that also pushes a long way in the red-wine direction, without losing the elegance of good Champagne. It’s the delicate touch of the tannins that makes this balancing act work. Very well-integrated acidity. Drink now.

From biodynamically grown grapes. Hard not to drink now, but will age wonderfully. I was blown away by the 2019 Red Blend from Quintessa, which is up with the crème de la crème of the vintage. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Carmenère, this full-bodied beauty has a perfectly balanced, seamless, yet expansive and classic 2019 style as well as gorgeous aromatics of cassis, flowers, chalky minerality, and integrated oak. It’s hard to resist already, but I have no doubt this will evolve for 20 years if stored properly. From the heart of Rutherford, made with both organic and Demeter-certified biodynamic grapes. Pure, vibrant aromas of dark berry fruit, liquorice, cassis, cardamom and rich earth. Penetrating to the core, with satiny robes of mixed blue and black fruits, crème de cassis,and a rich tapestry of very long, fine-grained tannins. A beautiful wine, drinking nicely now and should be enjoyed over the next few decades. The 2019 Proprietary Red Wine is more open and effusive than the 2018 version, with gentle floral nuances set against a backdrop of black cherries and cassis, joined by subtle notes of tobacco, cedar and vanilla. In the mouth, it's medium to full-bodied, streamlined, silky and lush, nicely balanced and elegant, with a long, softly dusty finish tinged with licorice and caramel. Tasted twice, with consistent notes. Best After 2023 Sports a very forward set of cassis and creamed plum notes before giving way to a firmer, more authoritative iron, warm earth and singed alder profile. Grippy and dense through the finish, but there's cut and drive, with a savory edge adding good energy. This just needs some time for the mineral side to settle in with the fruit. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Carmenère. Best from 2024 "

66,Taittinger Brut La,Francaise,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,65,12,4.4,284,"Bright and lively, this is one of my favorite non vintage Bruts. Crisp and balanced, with smooth, exuberant, Chardonnay-driven style; racy, elegant, and totally charming; long and memorable.  A dry, fresh and delicious Taittinger with aromas and flavors of apples, fresh lemons and minerals. Full-bodied. Precise. White pepper and salt at the end. 40% chardonnay and 35% pinot noir, the rest pinot meunier. Three to four years on the lees. Drink now. "
67,Piper-Heidsieck Cuvee,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,60,12,4.3,339,"A vivacious Champagne, this shows flavors of black cherry, toast point, white peach puree and salted almond set on a finely detailed mousse. Creamy and mouthwatering on the spiced finish. Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay. Drink now. Racy nose of real finesse appeals instantly. A well-hewn palate with bright florals and red fruit notes with delicate flavours of honey. Blend : 20% Chardonnay, 30% Pinot Meunier, 50% Pinot Noir This Champagne is rich while well balanced. Good bottle age gives spice and maturity to the apple and pear flavors. A solid structure and a zesty texture add extra dimension. A clean Champagne, green-gold in color with the flavor of peaches just coming into ripeness, this wine’s cool mineral savor brings to mind grapes sautéed in butter, as in sole Véronique, with which this wine would partner well.

68,Tenuta San Guido Sassicaia,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,Italy,269,14,4.8,35,"Sassicaia 2019 spent 25 months in oak (one-third new). ‘We are going longer in oak in the past few years,’ said Carlo Paoli, managing director of Tenuta San Guido. Quite pale in the glass, the nose is extremely graceful and intense with a lavender note enhanced by restrained bramble fruits, fermented citrus peel, an intense violet aroma and graphite minerality in depth. The attack is soft and full, the flavor savoury and cedary through to the finish, with integrated velvety tannins and lifted acidity. A perfectly woven structure is bound with signature freshness and fruit vibrancy, making this one for the long haul. The purity of cabernet sauvignon fruit is exceptional here, with character and sensibility that’s reminiscent of some of the great Sassicaias from the 1980s, such as 1982 or 1988. But this is much more precise and clean. Aromas and flavors of currants and berries with cedar and earth. Sage and minty character, too. It’s full-bodied yet there’s so much polish and balance, together with structure, elegance, and refinement. Hard not to drink at this stage, yet give it time and respect. This will be a classic Sass and reminds me why I love this wine. Try after 2026. The latest release from Tenuta San Guido is the 2019 Bolgheri Sassicaia. The bouquet is up front and very expressive from the get-go. It offers a generous display of crunchy, dark cherry that hints at the extra concentration and fruit weight obtained in the 2019 growing season. This vintage will be remembered for the crisp richness of the fruit and its important textural imprint. It also shows fine elegance, bordering on the ethereal, with berry aromas, tarry earth and brushes of balsam herb or grilled rosemary. Sassicaia always shows an almost-glossy finely knit quality to the polished mouthfeel, and I find it again here next to fresh acidity and firm tannins. Mouthfeel in 2019 is the wine's strongest suit. The 2019 is one of the prettiest and most balanced editions of Sassicaia we've seen this past decade, along with the back-to-back duo of 2016 and 2015. The 2019 marries the precision of the 2016 with the rich fruit weight of the 2015. Supple and beautifully defined, with black cherry, black currant and blackberry fruit augmented by tobacco, iron and thyme. Firmly structured, tightening up as this lingers with an aftertaste of dark fruit, graphite and spice. Shows a sense of elegance as well as power and intensity. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.  "
69,Ornellaia,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,Italy,270,14.5,4.4,8,"Pure delicious fruit expression on the nose, the best and brightest black cherry aromas, so pure and defined. Supremely elegant with delicate perfume surrounding the rich fruit aromas with a dusting of vanilla and milk chocolate. Excellent tension on the palate - you feel this is so direct and pristine, the flavours just driving from start to finish in one straight push but with concentration and intensity. It's not so layered or expansive at this point but so well executed - you can feel the power. Tannins are grippy with ripe blackcurrants, a fleshy kind of texture to the palate with a hint of dry stoniness and salinity on the finish alongside liquorice and clove. So young and too young to drink but this has incredible depth, confidence and restraint. It's sleeping now. This is a beautiful expression of coastal Tuscany and the sunny Mediterranean. The Ornellaia 2019 Bolgheri Superiore Ornellaia (a blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot) pours from the bottle with a specific darkness that has elements of both inky saturation and ruby highlights. The wine is saturated and rich—this is something you notice off the bat—but it also reveals a pleasing lightness or grace that is transmitted to both the bouquet and the palate. Dark fruit, pressed blackberry and plum mingle with more substantial aromas of spice, leather and sweetly cured tobacco. The tannins are beautifully managed, and the wine sports considerable heft and density on the palate that drives a very long and pleasurable mouthfeel. The aromas of blackcurrants, fresh basil and thyme, as well as cedar and sandalwood are so attractive. It’s full-bodied and very linear with tight tannins that draw you down the length of this young wine. Wet-earth and cool-stone undertones. It’s solid and so structured. A classic Ornellaia for the cellar. Best after 2027. The 2,000-case 2019 Ornellaia checks in as a blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 4% Petit Verdot, and the rest Cabernet Franc. It's a gorgeous wine in every facet, offering a translucent ruby hue as well as a gorgeous bouquet of redcurrants, black cherries, tobacco, dried herbs, and loamy earth. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has remarkable purity as well as depth, spot-on balance, ripe, building, yet perfectly integrated tannins, and a great, great finish. This is a wonderfully complete, balanced, ripe yet elegant Ornellaia that will cruise for 30+ years in cold cellars. A youthful red, concentrated and balanced, with blackberry, plum, earth and spice flavors gaining lift from the vibrant structure, while tannins envelop the lively fruit components. The finish is shored up by fine-grained tannins. This has all the components in the right place. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2025 through 2043. 2,000 cases imported. "
70,Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,69,13.6,4.6,8,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon is focused, stylish, and lovely from start to finish. The wine's soft yet persistent tannins give it a good elevation on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits aromas and flavors of red and blue fruits. Its berry nuances are balanced nicely with suggestions of subtle oak. Pair it with slow-roasted garlic and rosemary-infused leg of lamb. (Tasted; September 3, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Blending in 11% Merlot, 7% Petit Verdot and 2% Malbec, this elegant wine displays the great conditions of the vintage, allowing blackberry fruit, fig, cedar and a note of dark chocolate to mingle over a medium-bodied palate of refined tannin and oak.

Its deep purple color is followed by a classic, nicely structured Knights Valley Cabernet with lots of savory red and black fruits, loamy earth, tobacco leaf, and spice-driven aromas and flavors.

Very dense and meaty with an incredible tannin structure that enables this to be simultaneously very big and elegant. Super-long finish with enormous mineral freshness.

This is classic 2018 Napa Valley with its purity, freshness and precision as well as sensational concentration and perfectly integrated acidity, tannins, and alcohol. It delivers pleasure today yet warrants a solid 4-5 years of bottle age and is going to be a 30- to 40-year wine. So much black licorice in this, together with tar, blackcurrants, blackberries and slate. Full-bodied, but very toned and focused, with polish and energy. Extremely fine tannins and wonderful length. All about balance and purity. Gorgeous now, but this will age for decades to come. Great finish. Better after 2026. Frankly ripe but well-focused, with blackberry and creamed boysenberry notes flowing through atop a polished structure, while cocoa and black licorice frame the finish. A subtle hint of sassafras lingers on the finish, adding textural nuance. This has the stuffing to age well, too. Drink now. "

(Tasted: March 23, 2022, San Francisco, CA) It feels like there was a big change in the 2019 Catena Zapata Malbec Argentino, a year with a vibrant palate and very clean and focused aromas and flavors. They fine-tuned the irrigation and viticulture, and that seems to have increased the precision of the wine. They also did a selection and left the grapes from the borders of the vineyard, which were affected by the paths and other stuff. It's still a little more voluptuous than the wines from Gualtallary, as this mixes grapes from Angélica (Lunlunta) and Nicasia (Altamira). It's nicely textured and tasty, medium-bodied and with a vibrant finish. 25,200 bottles produced. It was bottled in November 2020.  A blend of malbec from two vineyards above 3,000 feet of elevation in La Consulta and Lunlunta, this wine’s suave texture is deepened and lengthened by 18 months in new French oak barrels, adding some vanilla flair to the finish. Vigil fermented it with 20 percent of the whole bunches, structuring the sun-ripened black raspberry flavors and rich layers of blueberry complexity. Air brings out the fresher aspects of the wine, hinting at years of development ahead.

83,Grgich Hills Estate Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,California,45,14.1,4.5,31,"When Mike Grgich made
the 1973 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay — the white wine that won the Paris Tasting
— he used fruit from the Bacigalupi Vineyard in the Russian River Valley. He soon
moved into a partnership with Austin Hills, assembling an organically farmed estate
that includes 88 acres in Carneros and 163 in American Canyon, the cool, southern
districts of the Napa Valley where this chardonnay grows. Now, at 98, Grgich leaves
winegrowing to his nephew, Ivo Jeramaz, who produced this complex and compelling
wine. Put aside any preconceptions you might have about contemporary Napa Valley
chardonnay; consider instead an agriculture that might include native corn (one taster
cited the ethereal sweetness of nixtamalized corn) and stone-fruit orchards (a scent of
apricots). There’s the smokiness of ancho chile and a scent of woodland mushrooms in the wine’s dark-toned leesiness. Then the layers of flavor last, harmonious and
delicious. Mangoes, papayas, cooked lemons, ripe melons, gun smoke and salted caramel on the nose. Full-bodied, ripe and rich yet bright. Smoky, toasty notes to close. From organically grown grapes. Orange blossom nose, ripe peach, pear and apricot. Tropical fruit on a broad, expansive palate. Rich, layered and a long, toasty finish. "

86,La Rioja Alta Vina Ardanza Reserva,2015,Tempranillo,Spain,39,14.5,4.3,160,"A rich nose of raspberry, crushed strawberry, blueberry, coconut, cedar and sweet spice. It’s medium-to full-bodied with fine tannins and fresh acidity. Creamy, balanced and layered with vibrant, spicy character. Long and polished. I tasted two vintages of their sleek and polished blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha, the oldest of which is the 2015 Viña Ardanza Reserva. It's a blend of 78% Tempranillo and 22% Garnacha (because they found that they needed a little more volume in the wine) from a powerful, warm and ripe year, very interesting to compare with the 2016. They consider 2015 a very good vintage; they compare it with 2001, a year when they produced all the wines. There are three wines from 2015, and there is something in common in all thee wines. The grapes were picked in mid-October and put through optical sorting to ferment followed by malolactic until the end of the year. The wine matured in used American oak barrels—the Tempranillo for 36 months with six manual rackings and the Garnacha for 30 months with five rackings.  Bright beacon of freshness, layers of dark cherry fruit, with hints of a bright Garnacha. Fine and soft tannin, lots of mocha and cacao. Juicy, lively, with a long finish. A model blend, excellent. This smooth red has a balsamic undertone, with dried cherry, herb, tobacco and anise notes mixed with sanguine and woodsy details. A refined, traditional style red. Drink now through 2030. "
87,Continuum,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,294,14.9,4.7,19,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Continuum Proprietary Red is remarkable from start to finish.

Better after 2026. Continuum's 2019 Proprietary Red is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Cabernet Franc, 7% Petit Verdot and 6% Merlot, all from the estate vineyard on Pritchard Hill. Aged in two-thirds new French oak, with the balance in second or third-use barrels and a single concrete amphora, it's remarkably dark in hue, a deep, saturated purple in the glass. On the nose, it's floral and herbal yet fruit-driven, with violets, sage and bay leaf adding nuance to black cherries, while the palate is full-bodied, plush and silky. There's an enticing yin-yang to the interplay between high-toned herbals and bass notes of dark chocolate in this dense, concentrated effort that finishes lush and long. It's a magnificent wine that should drink well for at least two decades. From the mighty estate site on Pritchard Hill, this robustly muscular wine consists of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Cabernet Franc (the highest amount ever), 7% Petit Verdot and 6% Merlot.

sites. It shows an opulent mouthfeel and 
teases of rose and forest floor. Cranberry, 
pomegranate and rhubarb come to mind 
on the palate, as full-bodied tannins and 
oak contrast it all. The 2019 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast, medium ruby in color, has a nose of red and black cherries, with touches of dusty earth, charcuterie and tar. Medium-bodied, the palate is silky and full of luscious, spice-laced red berry fruits, finishing long with a touch of floral perfume. The 2019 Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast is fresh with aromas of raspberry candy, wet stone, and cinnamon spice. The palate is forward and intense, with notes of iron-rich earth, a silky texture, fine-grained tannins, and rounded cherry fruit.  Opens with an intensely fruity aroma, 
with concentrated cherry, plum and red 
currant flavors that are filled with rich

Toffee apple allure on the palate with chalky coolness & savoury nutty finish. For those who would like to enjoy and impress, the Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label is a presentation par excellence! Just imagine the lovely yellow label in a wrap- pretty nifty and best of all the prized inside is so delicious! Medium straw, yellow color; complex aromas of ripe apple and light cream, excellent depth and persistence; medium bodied, active and layered on the palate; dry, medium acidity, well balanced; bright and beautiful ripe fruit and cream in the flavors; medium finish, lasting impression in the aftertaste. Calls for petrale in a Champagne reduction sauce with fresh, savory herbs.

This is tightly knit and racy, with a spicy underpinning and a clean-cut mix of poached pear, grated ginger and pink grapefruit zest. An aperitif style, showing a crisp, lacy finish. Drink now. "
90,Domaine Serene Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Oregon,96,13.5,0.0,0,"A firm and linear wine with some herbal and bark character. Blue fruit and dried strawberry. Floral. Full and tight with firmness and intensity. Give it three to four years to come around. The 2019 Pinot Noir Evenstad Reserve is forward and lifted with baking spice, clove, and cranberry.

91,Louis Roederer Collection,242,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,64,12,4.3,60,"Aromas of cooked apple, bread dough and lemon tart follow through to a full body with round, delicious fruit and a rich, flavorful finish. Yet, it remains tight and fine with lovely, compressed bubbles. New energy and freshness. Medium-to full-bodied with layers of fruit and vivid intensity. 42% chardonnay, 36% pinot noir and 22% pinot meunier. 8 grams dosage. Four years on the less. A new-format non-vintage that designates the year of the 242nd harvest, 2017, plus reserve wine of 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Drink or hold. For all its freshness and finesse, Roederer’s new
multivintage release also exhibits notable warmth and generosity. On the nose, ginger joins baked apple and frangipane tart; the mouth, meanwhile, fills all the way up with sunbathed orchard fruits, plus hints of lime zest and oak spice. The finish, like the perlage, goes on and on. This first release of Roederer’s new Collection is based on the 2017 harvest, the 242nd for the house. This wine replaces Brut Premier. Jean-Bap- tiste Lécaillon bases the Collection blend on a “perpetual reserve,” held in stainless steel since 2012, with wine added in each vintage: half pinot noir, half chardonnay, none of it having undergone malolactic conversion. For the 242 blend, he included some oak- aged reserve wines before selecting individual parcel wines from partner growers, focusng on chardonnay, along with some meunier and pinot noir from the Marne Valley. The final blend is 34 percent perpetual reserve, 10 percent oak-aged reserves, and 56 percent from the 2017 harvest. While Brut Premier was a more spherical wine in the mouth, Collection 242 is finer, with greater length of flavor and more energy. The scent is floral and seashell-mineral, the texture caressing, then tense. Softly shimmering straw gold, green tints, with a delicate filigree dancing at will around the glass. The nose is gently authoritative; spring flowers garlanding stone fruit, a hint of hawthorn maybe, then lemongrass. The palate has encyclopaedic depth, the intricacies of the Perpetual Reserve weaving their early magic; almond, sloe, gingerbread and apples; the finish has a pleasing twist of bitterness, courtesy of the small percentage of oak-aged reserve wine. Maybe the dosage (8g/L) can come down even further, such is the engaging and subtle complexity harnessed elsewhere?

Bright aromatics, vibrant red berry fruit and mid-weight structure give the 2019 its charming, sensual personality. I am surprised to see how open the 2019 is at this stage. I imagine it might close down a bit post-bottling, but the 2019 has superb balance to go with a real feeling of openness, at least today. Red/purplish berry fruit, rose petal, lavender and sweet spice shape the inviting finish. Not shy, this throws a pretty lush and gorgeous wave of warmed cassis and mulberry puree at you, carried by very polished tannins as violet, red licorice and sweet tobacco hints fill in behind.

The 2012 Champagne Brut is equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir and has 8 grams per liter dosage. Since the 1950s, only 30 vintages have been produced by the house. The aromatics are reminiscent of a Burgundian feel, with pleasant flinty reduction, smoke, and vibrant green fruits of pear and citrus blossoms.

Best after 2022. 2012 is the 30th opus of this cuvée. Since 1938, and the acquisition of Laurent-Perrier by the Nonancourt family, it has been crafted to be a subtle balance between ‘the house style and the vintage style,’ according to Michel Fauconnet, Laurent-Perrier’s chef de caves. The Pinot Noir, which comprises half the blend and which Fauconnet describes as very ‘powerful’, is sourced from five villages: Bouzy, Verzy, Aÿ, Mailly, and for the first time in the history of this cuvée, Rilly-la-Montagne, which is not a grand cru village. The Chardonnay, which makes up the other half of the blend, is sourced from the villages of Le-Mesnil-sur-Oger, Oger, Cramant and Chouilly. ‘The year 2012 was characterised by successive climatic accidents. There was a major winter frost as well as a spring frost, not to mention 10 or so episodes of hail, causing significant damage. A hailstorm on the seventh of June caused extensive damage in various villages,’ said Laurent-Perrier. In spite of this, the dry and sunny summer brought about a beautiful maturity. With an energetic yet bright bouquet, the Laurent-Perrier 2012 possesses gorgeous aromas of orchard fruits, herbs, lemon and spices, with a hint of menthol. Calcareous on the palate, the structure is medium- to full-bodied, with a laser-like texture and a long and penetrating finish. It is undeniably one of the frank successes of the vintage, and while it has no need for further ageing, it may surprise us even further in the future.

127,Opus One (375ML half-bottle),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,199,13.5,0.0,0,"The purity of fruit is really something else here, with currants and fresh flowers, such as violets and roses. Flower stems as well. Fantastic length and structure to the wine, with tightness and focus. Wonderful fruit. Graceful. A blend of 78% cabernet sauvignon, 8% merlot, 7% petit verdot, 6% cabernet franc and 1% malbec. Try after 2028. Elegantly styled, despite some serious heft, this offers a mix of alluring mulberry, griotte and cassis notes bearing a gently mulled edge, while flashes of apple wood, sweet bay leaf and red tea flicker along the edges. Very refined in feel, with seamless structure extending the finish so the fruit can linger. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Drink now through 2038. "
128,DuMOL Wester Reach Pinot Noir,2020,Pinot Noir,California,79,13.8,4.7,6,"The 2020 Pinot Noir Wester Reach is one of Dumol's larger cuvées, and production was normal despite the challenges of the vintage (3,750 cases). It has alluring purity on the nose, with scents of cranberries, rhubarb, tobacco leaves, orange peel and aniseed. The medium-bodied palate is concentrated and powerful without losing detail, framed by powdery tannins and refreshing acidity. It offers an array of spice and floral accents on the finish. Lovely! Best After 2022 The 2020 Pinot Noir Wester Reach has a rich perfume of black cherry cola, sassafras, and sweet violets. The palate is full and ripe, with black raspberry as well as ripe tannins and a note of black tea.  "
129,Bibi Graetz Colore 20th Anniversary Label,2019,Tuscan Blends,Italy,249,0,5.0,22,"This is so perfumed and seductive, with blackberries, cherries, dried flowers and perfume. It’s full-bodied and tight with very fine tannins. Really structured and long. Superb tannin texture. So fine, yet so powerful. This is an incredible combination of fruit and structure. Old-vine magic. Drink after 2026. The ‘dream’ in Italian, this is from very old, high-altitude vineyards on stony soils mixed with sand and stone. This is one of the wines of the tasting, a real showstopper that captures your interest and holds it all the way. Red cherries and strawberries dominate the nose with softly-spiced liquorice touches. But it’s the texture that’s so captivating, gripping straight away and holding you there, but in a soft and gentle way. Bright acidity comes in keeping things fresh and welcoming while the structure and length give a lovely roundness. A real success. Grapes for Colore are sourced from three vineyards, with each harvested up to eight times. After the first selection in the vineyards, a second selection occurs at the winery before destemming where grapes are softly pressed and placed in open-top barriques, keeping each plot and parcel separate from the others. The fermentation is conducted naturally by indigenous yeasts without temperature control lasting up to two weeks, with one extra week of maceration on the skins. After the fermentation the wine is moved into new barriques, where the malolactic fermentation happens. Each parcel is aged separately for almost 20 months before the final blend is decided. Dressed for a party, the Bibi Graetz 2019 Colore celebrates the estate's 20th anniversary with a special commemorative (2000-2019) bottle. This vintage of Colore is 100% Sangiovese (the small part of Colorino in the blend we saw last year has been removed) because Bibi thought the Sangiovese elegant enough to stand alone. Fruit comes from three vineyard sites with 70-, 80- and 90-year-old vines, respectively. The wine offers big intensity and beautifully lifted aromas and more textural support than we saw in the slightly thinner 2018 vintage. The bouquet reveals balsam herb, cassis, pressed rose, garden mint and crushed stone. Fruit from the southern-most site, Poggio Matto in Casciano del Murlo (in the province of Siena), was blended in at a greater percentage to help build the structure and momentum of this cellar-worthy wine. "
130,Graham's 20 Year Old Tawny,Port,Port,Portugal,68,20,4.5,412,"Tawny Port is always exciting, but if you can afford to splash out, go for a 20 Year Old. All the major houses make wonderful aged tawnies and this is always one of the best. Ethereal and mellow on the palate, it boasts flavours of toffee and caramel, burnt orange and raisins, dried plums, hazelnuts and a savoury hint of mushroom on the finish. Wonderful stuff! Dried cherry, iodine and peat with some watermelon. Hints of toffee and bark. Medium-to full-bodied, sweet and layered with a tannin texture and rich finish. Tangy and focused. Drink now. Earthy rather than fruity, this is all about umami, its cool cellar tones layering dark mushroom and savory black bean flavors over papaya. It lasts with intriguing complexity that would work with a range of umami-rich foods, like seafood in an XO sauce. Lovely, with date and persimmon notes that are melded seamlessly, picking up light bitter orange, ginger and green tea accents along the way. Echoes of sweet golden raisin and hazelnut linger on the finish, which is polished and long. A beauty. Drink now. This is a hugely dry, burnt style, very concentrated. The licorice and bitter coffee flavors are dense, layered and well balanced with the acidity. A serious wine that demands attention. "
131,Freemark Abbey Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,65,14.5,4.2,43,"Aromas of blackcurrants, spearmint, licorice and lead pencil follow through to a medium body with firm tannins and a fresh finish. Hints of chocolate and almonds. Really polished. Very drinkable now, but will age beautifully. There are roughly 25,000 cases of the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley, which is sourced from all over the valley. Certainly a beautiful wine worth seeking out (and it should be easy to find), it has ample ripe cherry and cassis fruits as well as spicy oak and tobacco nuances. This impeccably made, medium-bodied, elegant Cabernet will shine for a decade. Best After 2021 There are an impressive 20,000 cases of the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley, a blend of 87% Cabernet Sauvignon with 8% Merlot, 2% each Malbec and Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc, aged in 40% new oak. About half of the fruit is sourced from estate (organically grown) vineyards, while the balance is purchased. Lovely herb-inflected cassis and hints of ripe cherries appear on the nose, while the palate is medium to full-bodied, silky and fine, but with some substance and concentration, finishing with soft, dusty tannins. Good concentration, balance, length. Freshly-picked blackcurrants, black cherries, blackcurrant leaf, subtle toast and clove notes. Bright acidity brings refreshment to the concentrated, layered black fruit flavours. Firm, fine-grained tannins. Long, detailed finish. Blend : 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot, 2% Malbec "
132,L'Aventure Estate Cuvee,2019,Other Red Blends,California,119,15.2,4.2,17,"Pure perfection from Paso Robles, the 2019 Estate Cuvee checks in as 50% Syrah, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 15% Petit Verdot that was raised in 81% new French oak. Incredible cassis and black berry fruits as well as violets, chocolate, graphite, and who knows what else emerges from the glass, and it hits the palate with full-bodied richness, a concentrated yet weightless mouthfeel, building tannins, and a great finish. It’s more seamless and approachable than the more backward, structured 2018 and will have two decades of prime drinking. Opaque ruby. A highly complex, expansive bouquet evokes smoke-accented black and blue fruits, oak spices, incense, mocha and potpourri. Sappy, sharply delineated cassis, blueberry and cherry preserve flavors show energetic mineral lift and betray no rough edges. In an ample but lively style, finishing smoky and wonderfully long, with a resonating cherry note and chewy tannins that sneak in late. "

135,Craggy Range Winery Te Muna Road Vineyard Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Zealand,47,13,0.0,0,"This has hit an impressive trajectory with very well-curated, fresh blueberry, red-cherry and black-cherry aromas, swathed in sweet baking spices and fresh-tilled earth. The palate has sleekly defined tannins, carrying intense, ripe blueberry and red-cherry flavors, amid deeply buried spice. Impressive, this is the finest Aroha to date. Drink or hold. This is not a timid wine. It's rich and round, wearing its brambly, medicinal, earthy, spicy and floral colors loud and proud. The silky mouthfeel is tugged into place by sappy tannins. There's intensity, balance and structure, and a real sense of place. Drink now. "
136,Turnbull Cabernet Sauvignon,2020,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,49,14.7,0.0,0,"Some dried-herb character to the baked blackberries and graphite on the nose. Rich, smooth and flavorful on the palate, swathed by dark cherries, cassis and firm yet juicy and polished tannins. Drink or hold. "
137,Paraduxx Proprietary Red,2019,Other Red Blends,California,54,14.5,4.3,27,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Paraduxx Proprietary Red Wine is powerful, packed, and finely structured. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of black fruit, licorice, berries, and oak. Enjoy with the first cut from a slowly-roasted prime rib. (Tasted: December 18, 2021, San Francisco, CA) A blend of 53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petite Sirah, 12% Zinfandel, 11% Petit Verdot, 7% Syrah and 5% Malbec, the 2019 Proprietary Red Wine delivers notes of cassis, blackberries and blueberries on the nose, backed by an underlay of mocha-tinged oak. It's medium to full-bodied, decently concentrated and nicely balanced, marrying silky tannins to a bright, vibrant finish. Best After 2022 "
138,Bodegas Muga Prado Enea Gran Reserva,2015,Tempranillo,Spain,99,14.5,3.8,5,"Reserved and polished, this is a Prado Enea with great class and focus. It’s so aromatic,with plum, peach, cherry and cedar character. Salted olives, too. Medium-to full-bodied with very fine tannins and a long, fresh finish. Elegance with power here. Give it three or four years to open, but already impressive. The most classical of their wines, the 2015 Prado Enea Gran Reserva is a blend of Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo and Graciano, mostly from Rioja Alta (Sajazarra, Cellorigo and Fonzaleche), but the Garnacha is from different plots in the zone of Tudelilla at high altitude. These grapes are always picked last, but the wine has a similar alcohol level as the rest, around 14.5% in a warm year like 2019. The modus operandi is similar to other of the top cuvées—harvested into 200-kilogram boxes, destemming, optical sorting and fermentation in small oak casks with indigenous yeasts. The élevage in this case is extended to 36 months, and the barrels are only 10% new. This is, year in, year out, my favorite wine from Muga, and in this powerful and ripe year, these late-harvesting vines ripened thoroughly and delivered a full array of aromas and flavors so that the wine has plenty of depth and complexity. It has a very classical profile, with incipient tertiary notes, perfumed, floral and rich, textured and beautifully balanced. They compare this 2015 with 2009 and 2005 in terms of style but with freshness in the style of 2001 and 2010. It's enjoyable but should also develop for a long time in bottle. One of the finest Prado Enea vintages. The 2015 Prado Enea Gran Reserva comes from a hotter, riper vintage, but it shares similar gamey, exotic aromatics of red and black fruits, sappy herbs, flowers, leather, iron, and background cedary oak. Rich, medium to full-bodied, incredibly pure, and balanced, it has ripe, still present tannins, impeccable balance, and a great finish. This is a classic expression of this cuvée that can be enjoyed any time over the coming two decades or more. Well-tailored in an understated way, this harmonious red is plushly creamy on the palate, like fine cashmere, showing seamless integration of the sculpted tannins with finely detailed flavors of black cherry and black plum reduction, sandalwood, cedar, green olive, espresso crema and minerally smoke and iron. Long and lightly juicy on the refined finish. Tempranillo, Graciano, Mazuelo and Garnacha. "
139,Chateau Lynch-Bages,2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,129,14,4.3,20,"This is a focused and tight Lynch with beautiful blackcurrants, slate, graphite and lead pencil. Medium to full body. Very fine tannins and brightness. Linear line of tannins that runs nicely through the wine. A blend of 70% cabernet sauvignon, 24% merlot, 4% cabernet franc and 2% petit verdot. This concentrated, dense wine follows the estate’s hallmark richness. Solid and generous, it has both weight and layers of fresh acidity. The wine promises well, ready to drink from 2024. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, brought up in 75% new French oak, the 2017 Chateau Lynch-Bages sports an inky color as well as a powerful, full-bodied style. Rocking blackcurrants, chocolate, smoked tobacco, and obvious minerality all emerge from this beautiful, concentrated wine that has building tannins, the more elegant, silky style of the vintage, a great mid-palate, and a blockbuster finish. It's going to hit the ground running in about 5-7 years and cruise 20 years or more in cool cellars. Another wine that is packed with Pauillac signature; one where you feel the tightness and the bristle of the tannins. They have done a great job of carefully extracting the tannins while maintaining a fresh menthol current running through the backbone of the wine. The fruit lacks a little plushness and concentration compared to the 2016 or 2018, but this is impressive. It's a year where names count, and Lynch Bages is claiming its place at the table. This leans toward the austere side of Pauillac, with a slightly bracing iron and chalk frame around a core of red and black currant fruit, liberally laced with savory and cedar notes. Exhibits ample length and cut, showing really pure and beautifully defined currant flavors. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2024 through 2040.  Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2017 Lynch Bages sashays out of the glass with flamboyant scents of baked blackcurrants, blackberry preserves and mulberries plus touches of lavender, dark chocolate, star anise and unsmoked cigars. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has bags of class and finesse with firm, finely-grained tannins and seamless freshness, finishing long and fragrant. "
140,Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,80,14.5,4.0,10,"This delicious, bold red offers inviting aromas of fragrant blue flowers, spiced plum, forest floor and pipe tobacco. Full and enveloping in feel, it delivers a great depth of juicy black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and baking spice flavors framed in velvety tannins. Drink 2025–2032. Generous, layered and rich, the Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona 2017 Brunello di Montalcino shows the generous fruit and deep layering that identifies this vintage. It also delivers a powerful 15% alcohol. This edition (with 69,000 bottles made) shows a bright note of sweet cherry that features strongly both on the bouquet and the palate. The wine shows lots of soft fruit with almond, spice and wild rose. Aromas of cedar, berry, mushroom and burnt orange follow through to a full body with medium, chewy tannins and a fluid, flavorful finish. Not overdone. Drink after 2023. Rich and lively, exuding cherry, plum and blackberry fruit, with accents of earth and underbrush. Harmonious and accessible now, with fine length and a lingering, mineral-tinged finish. Best from 2024. "
141,Eden Rift Estate Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,47,13.8,4.7,29,"A layered and fine-grained pinot with strawberry and cherry aromas and flavors. Flint and some cranberry and watermelon, too. Pure. Medium to full body, bright acidity and light asphalt to the strawberry and raspberry undertones. Drink or hold. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Eden Rift Vineyards Estate Pinot Noir is well-built and lasting on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of rustic earth, savory spices, black fruit, and black tea. Try it with garlic and rosemary-infused roast leg of lamb. (Tasted: June 17, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The 2018 Pinot Noir Estate is another outstanding wine. Notes of Bing cherries, mulberries, loamy earth, and forest floor all emerge from the glass, and it's medium-bodied, has a rounded, balanced mouthfeel, nicely integrated acidity, and enough structure to keep it drinking well for at least 7-8 years. It's rock solid. Clean lines of plump black raspberry, pastry crust and tarragon make for a delicious nose on this estate bottling. Snappy raspberry flavors kick off the sip, where lilac, wild mint and dried herbs prove both fresh and delicate. Made from Dijon clone vines, the 2018 Pinot Noir Estate has a pale ruby-purple color and scents of spiced rhubarb and black cherries with notes of fragrant earth and tangerine peel. The palate is light-bodied, silky, bright and juicy with spice-laced fruits and a layered finish. Vinous and red fruited, of the six 2018s from Eden Rift, this may be the most structured, showing a rosy scent at a distance, and dried cherry and strawberry flavors. There’s much in place but it needs time. "
142,Col d'Orcia Brunello di Montalcino,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,55,14.5,4.3,19,"The 2016 Col d’Orcia Brunello offers notes of pine resin, black cherry, and dried strawberry aromatics. The palate is concentrated and compact, with dried tomato leaf bitterness and tobacco. The structure is not shy, with a rich core of fruit, bold tannin upfront and just as much acidity to match. This is a bold wine for the 2016 vintage, packed with sun-kissed warmth. It commands time in the cellar, so drinking is recommended over 2026-2041. Underbrush, wild-berry, pipe-tobacco and violet aromas lead the nose. On the full-bodied palate, taut tannins support black cherry, licorice and ground clove. Drink 2024–2031. A very polished, refined red with berry and flower aromas, as well as hints of citrus and rose petals. Medium to full body, fine tannins and a juicy finish. Lovely polish. From organically grown grapes. Give it a year or two to come around, but already very pretty. "
143,DAOU Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon,2021,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,30,14.5,4.2,60,"The nose on this wine is herbal with anise, oregano and pencil-shaving aromas, while blackberry and cocoa provide depth. Fennel pollen and roasted nut flavors meet with rich berry on the palate, where tannins are light but present. COMMENTARY: The 2021 DAOU Discovery Collection Cabernet Sauvignon is pleasing, well-balanced, and lovely to enjoy now. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits aromas and flavors of loganberries and savory spices. Enjoy its soft touch in the finish with grilled cheeseburgers. (Tasted: September 17, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "
144,Novellum Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,France,16,13,4.0,210,"A richer styled wine (I've compared this cuvée to a Chardonnay from Mark Aubert), the 2020 Novellum has a medium gold hue as well as a rich, powerful bouquet of caramelized lemon, honeyed almonds, candle wax, and toasted bread. Rich, medium to full-bodied, beautifully textured, and balanced, this is another no brainer purchase. "
145,Ulysses Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,180,0,4.0,12,"Aromas of terra cotta, chocolate and hazelnut with iron and ink. Dusty. Full-bodied and round. Layered. Flamboyant and juicy. Rather soft and gorgeous. Some walnut and chocolate at the end. Persistent. Always there. Drinkable now, but will age wonderfully. The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon is the best wine off Christian Moueix's Oakville ranch so far. Deep, creamy and generous, the 2018 captures the unqiue blend of fruit in a savoriness that is typical of the southern sector of Oakville where cooling winds from the south lend palpable freshness and vivacity to the vines. Black fruit, chocolate, spice, lavender and new leather are some of the many notes that build into the sumptuous finish. The current-release 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon shows more cherries and bay leaf on the nose than prior vintages. There's still a solid framework of cedar, loam and cassis, hints of mocha and licorice, but there's also a bit more freshness and lift. It's medium to full-bodied and densely concentrated yet silky and finessed, with a long, elegant finish. Dark and reserved in style, with a core of black currant and blackberry reduction wrapped in singed alder and warm loam. Tightly wound for now, with the fruit held in check, but the underlying structure is polished and there's mineral-laced drive on the finish. "
146,Chateau Latour,2005,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,179",13,4.5,39,"A great wine, the summation of a great vintage in Bordeaux. The core of richness, the dense, bone-dry tannins, the black currants, red berries and black plum skins are the elements, but it’s the way they have been integrated that makes this such an impressive wine. There is great elegance as well, a fabulous counterpoint to such power. Cellar for at least 15 years, but this will keep forever. The 2005 Latour was mind-blowingly profound in two recent tastings for this report. Deep and sensual to the core, the 2005 is utterly captivating. All the elements are so seamlessly put together. Graphite, crème de cassis, licorice, dark spice and lavender infuse the 2005 with so much energy. More than anything else, though, the 2005 is a Latour of texture and resonance. Even after several hours, the 2005 is fresh and full of energy. Wines like this are just life affirming. That's about all I can really say. Tasted two times. How rare to confront a wine of this inner strength and perfect form. Grown at a 116-acre vineyard at the southern border of Pauillac, some of the vines now reaching 100 years of age on a gravel bar overlooking the Gironde, Latour harvests cabernet sauvignon with natural power. I could describe it as colors, from glistening ruby to purple-black then back to scarlet tannins that vibrate in red. Or just the pure, unadulterated flavor of black currant, unformed as a child is unformed, beautiful as a child is beautiful. However I might describe it, the wine is stronger than I am and will outlast me by decades. This is the most provocative and most brilliant Latour I have tasted on release. A very complex nose of lavender, currants, spices, and hot stones. Full and dense on the palate, with a very tight structure. The tannins have a perfect polish to their density, and the finish is very intense, with wonderful fruit and truffle character. This turns almost decadent, with tremendous energy and a constantly changing profile. This is a very challenging wine to get to know, please leave this for at least ten years. Dark ruby black in color. Brilliant, intense aromas of mineral, blackberry and currant, with hints of Indian spices and cigar box, lead to a full-bodied palate, with ultrafine tannins and a beautiful balance of blackberry, raspberry and mineral. There's subtlety, yet also great depth. Lasts for minutes on the palate. This is a Latour with fabulous tone and vigor. Best after 2018. 12,500 cases made. "
147,DAOU Vineyards Pessimist Red Blend,2020,Other Red Blends,California,30,15.2,4.1,127,"Always a Petite Sirah-dominated wine, the 2020 Pessimist sports an inky purple color as well as a great, full-bodied style carrying wonderful blue fruits, spring flowers, spice, and vanilla aromas and flavors. It's textured, has ripe tannins, loads of fruit, and is about as sexy and gulpable as they come. Deep ruby-purple, the 2020 Pessimist is a blend of 62% Petite Sirah, 18% Syrah, 18% Zinfandel and 2% Lagrein, matured for 10 months in 60% new French oak. It's scented of black cherries with touches of purple flowers, graphite and grilled meats, and the medium-bodied palate is grainy and fresh with a long, perfumed finish. This offers fantastic quality for the price. Dense elderberry, charred meat and smoky wood aromas combine on the nose of this always enjoyable and attention-grabbing bottling. Black plum and roasted blackberry flavors meet with a stemmy herb touch on the ripe palate. "
148,J. de Villebois Sancerre,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,France,31,0,3.8,5,"Smoke, sliced green apples and lime juice on the nose, following through to a dry and limey palate with crunchy, lingering green apple. Zesty and succulent, with some nice texture to it, too. An excellent introduction to Sancerre. Drink now. "
149,Patz & Hall Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,48,14.5,4.7,8,"This is a great representation of coastal intensity and freshness, built around a spicy, full- bodied core of dark-berry fruit, crushed rock and dried herb. Forest and tea accents underscore its wild appeal and provenance. "
150,Damilano Barolo Lecinquevigne,2016,Nebbiolo,Italy,46,14.5,4.3,17,"This is really creamy and delicious with chocolate, hazelnut, dried-berry and walnut character. Round and chewy with polished tannins, it turns ripe and beautiful. Such pure fruit. Try after 2023. There are plenty of savory notes—eucalyptus, juniper and thyme—reconciled by cherry and earth flavors in this red, which shows a midpalate sweetness before the pointed tannins emerge. The finish is long and satisfying. Best from 2023 through 2040. This is a blend of the five vineyard sites farmed by Damilano, and if you look at the single-vineyard wines in this portfolio, you see Brunate, Liste, Cerequio, Cannubi and Raviole. The 2016 Barolo Lecinquevigne offers a 360-degree view of Barolo with pretty primary fruit backed by elegant tannins and mid-weight fruit fiber. The wine is a happy sum of its various parts, and as expected, you can't really make out the characteristics of any one unique growing site. That's exactly the philosophy behind a blended wine like Lecinquevigne. The wine ages in large oak casks for 24 months. Pressed rose, woodland-berry and menthol aromas take center stage. It's full bodied and tense, offering dried cherry, cranberry and licorice framed in tight fine-grained tannins that leave a drying close. Drink 2024–2031. Lecinquevigne is produced from five vineyards in the communes of Barolo, Grinzane Cavour, and Monforte, and was aged for 24 months in large barrels of 20-100 hectoliters. The 2016 Barolo Lecinquevigne has classic aromas of tar, dried leather, cherry, and violets. Its structure is up-front, with tannic grip and driving acidity, fresh cranberry, orange rind, and clove. The 2016 is tightly wound and will benefit from cellaring 3-5 years. Drink 2024-2042. An assembly of fruit from vines in five different communes of Barolo, this approachable wine offers flavors of dark cherry, tobacco and cocoa wrapped in round, supple tannins. "
151,Bodegas Muga Seleccion Especial,2016,Tempranillo,Spain,50,14.5,4.3,142,"A very pretty, manicured young red with plum, berry and dark-chocolate character. Medium body and round tannins that are focused and firm. Delicious, succulent finish. Plenty of subtle fruit and supple tannins take you to where you want to go in fine Rioja red. Drinkable now but linear and tight. Give it some time. Better after 2021. Always a terrific wine, the 2016 Selección Especial is based on 70% Tempranillo, 20% Garnacha, and the rest Graciano and Mazuelo. Almost Rhône-like with its spicy, meaty, gamey style, this beauty offers lots of red and black currants, cedary spice, incense, and tobacco aromas and flavors. It's medium to full-bodied, has terrific balance, silky tannins, and is just a class act. The 2015 is a richer, more opulent wine, while the 2016 shows a touch more freshness and elegance. Both are beautiful vintages worth buying, cellaring, and drinking. COMMENTARY: The 2016 Muga Selección Especial is wine in the upper tier of the world's highest acclaimed red wines, and this vintage merits this level of accolades. TASTING NOTES: This wine shows a powerful presence in its aromas and flavors of concentrated black fruit and substantial weight on the palate.

152,Iron Horse Wedding Cuvee,2018,Vintage Sparkling Wine,California,56,13.5,0.0,0,"This beautiful bubbly is stately yet festive, with effusive notes of raspberry and zesty lemon accented with graham cracker and fresh ginger as this fans out on the finish, picking up creamy and spicy notes along the way.

153,Domaine Drouhin Vaudon Chablis,2020,Chardonnay,France,30,12.5,4.1,84,"COMMENTARY: The 2020 Domaine Drouhin Vaudon is true-to-type, refined, and delicious. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits focused aromas and flavors of apple, peach, and mineral notes. Try it with linguine and clams. (Tasted: September 11, 2021, San Francisco, CA) A mix of estate-grown and purchased fruit, this gains its richness over the course of eight months aging on the lees in stainless steel. It’s a refreshing, simple wine with classical Chablis notes of citrus and savory nuts, opening to floral earthiness that hints at freshly churned butter and bloomy-rind cheeses. Add some crusty bread and ripe Epoisses and you’d have a meal. Well-delineated, revealing floral, apple, lemon and crushed gravel aromas and flavors. Linear and vibrant, with fine balance, length and a lip-smacking finish.  "
154,Caparzo Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,49,14.5,4.1,12,"This is the so-called ""green label"" Brunello with proprietor Elisabetta Gnudi Angelini's signature on the front of the bottle. Her classic 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is sharp and tonic with wild raspberry, cassis, lilac, earth and garden herb. There is a sweet note of sour cherry on the mid-weight finish. This is an ample 160,000-bottle production made in a traditional approach with two years in casks made with both Slavonian and French oak.

Structured yet supple, with vibrant black cherry, toasty mocha and spice flavors that finish with polished tannins.  This wine shows some reduction out of the gate. Behind that are notes of cassis, anise and herbs. The palate is flavorful with red and black fruit notes but has a reserved sensibility to it. There's plenty of structure around it all. A warm finish caps it off. "

Some sappy undergrowth, too. The palate has neatly articulated tannins and flavors that run to quite deep, darker-fruit tones. Rich finish. This is convincing. Drink or hold. This is an exceptionally aromatic year for this wine, which jumps from the glass with spicy raspberry and cherry fruit. In the mouth it's sharp and a bit peppery, with some bite to the tannins. Aerate it if drinking over the next couple of years, or give it a bit of cellar time to smooth it out further.

It’s the first Pahlmeyer wine to include fruit from the Upper Range Vineyard, a new planting above the Silverado Trail east toward Pritchard Hill. This 2018 is a lovely, rosy cabernet, the fruit following along with the tannins in a harmony of woodland scents, forest blueberry, tight cranberry and a light, fruity mushroom dimension. It’s bright, full-on joyous cabernet, with a lasting finish that suggests there’s more to come with age. "

165,Larkmead Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,129,14.7,0.0,0,"This red is earthy in tones of barnyard, sage and crushed rock, with underlying plush fruit. With 15% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc included, it boasts rich red fruit that broadens and lengthens the midpalate. It shows an enduring succulence on the balanced finish. Very savoury and spice-laden on the nose, showing aromas of cigar box, chicory, sandalwood and redcurrants. The palate is beautifully multidimensional: deep but bright, weighty and forward but with great length and integration. A definitive showing of Calistoga, built for at least two decades in the cellar but will also reward those who want to check in at an earlier stage. Brought up in 66% new French oak. Pretty aromas of currants, walnuts and fresh tobacco follow through to a full-bodied palate with dusty, chewy tannins and lots of berry, coffee and lightly toasted-oak undertones in the aftertaste. Needs some time to resolve the tannins. Very drinkable now, but better after 2025. A flash of menthol leads off, followed quickly by intense cassis, blackberry preserves and plum reduction flavors. Notes of singed alder and cedar score the finish, with the menthol hint peeking back in for an encore. Distinctive. Best from 2022 through 2036. A blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, aged in French oak (66% new), the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon (White Label) has a medium to deep garnet-purple color and skips out of the glass with bright, cheery scents of kirsch, black raspberries and cassis plus nuances of red roses, pencil shavings, cinnamon stick and wild sage plus a touch of lavender. Medium to full-bodied, the palate offers a gorgeous, plush texture and just enough freshness to lift the generous black and red berry layers to a long, fragrant finish. Based on 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, and 10% Cabernet Franc, the base 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon is a beauty, offering classic currant and mulled cherry fruits as well as plenty of cedarwood, tobacco, and spice aromas and flavors. It's rich and medium to full-bodied, with some grippy tannins and a classy finish. It's going to benefit from 2-4 years of bottle age and keep for 15-20. "
166,Cambria Katherine's Vineyard Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,22,14.1,3.7,68,"The 2020 Chardonnay Katherine's Vineyard is bright and wonderfully saline, with plenty of mineral and savory accents. Citrus peel, mint, white pepper, chalk and dried flowers open nicely with a bit of time. There's terrific energy and plenty of cut. Most of this fruit is sourced from the own-rooted vines first planted in 1971. Dried lime peel, seared lemon pith, white flower and a hint of grass show on the nose of this bottling. There’s an earthy, crushed rock element to the palate, where dried apple and herb flavors also arise. "
167,Penfolds Bin 389 Cabernet-Shiraz,2018,Other Red Blends,Australia,80,14.5,4.2,160,"A blend of 57% cabernet sauvignon and 43% shiraz, this has a very impressively complete feel, a hallmark of the 2018 vintage wines, and there’s a myriad of characters with cabernet’s cedary and gently herbal notes sitting atop a core of rich red-plum and dark-berry shiraz fruit aromas. So integrated. The palate has a very silky texture, so plush and polished with a wealth of rich and intense dark-plum, dark-berry and blackcurrant flavors. The oak is completely soaked with ripe, fresh fruit. This is a great Bin 389. Drink over the next two decades. Confident Cabernet (57%) leads this high-spirited, swirling dance, as a breezy wisp of blue and black berries waft over the earthy bulk of sturdy Shiraz. It’s a clever trick for such bright fruit to be contained by tannins in an interlocked embrace, without smothering the obvious exuberance of this marriage. Supple and nimble, it keeps shifting and changing in the glass. A truly beautiful blend.  Hints of toasted coconut accent big cassis aromas on the nose of the 2018 Bin 389 Cabernet Shiraz, which is a 57-43 blend this vintage. Full-bodied, with cherry flesh complementing the sterner cassis and tobacco notes, it's supple enough to be approachable now, yet with the concentration and requisite dusty tannins on the long finish to support more than a decade of aging COMMENTARY: The Penfolds Bin 389 has been one of the world's top examples of the Cabernet-Shiraz blends. The 2018 vintage continues this wine's success story. TASTING NOTES: This wine deftly combines red and black fruit aromas and flavors with notes of minerality and savory spices. Enjoy it with a well-seasoned, slow-cooked beef stew. (Tasted: August 29, 2020, San Francisco, CA)  In typical Penfolds style, this Cab, Shiraz blend is a rich, polished wine lacquered in high-end oak. Lurking beneath the barrel-driven furniture polish, mocha and spice notes is a plush layer of berry fruit and a minty, herbal nuance. The alcohol shows some warmth on the gauzy palate while woody tannins cinch the fruit. A wine for chewing rather than sipping, this will requite a mega amount of protein and several years in cellar. Drink 2023–2035.  "
168,Argiano Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,90,14.5,4.5,11,"Very attractive floral and fresh aromas to the plums and cherries, following through to the palate. Flavorful and gorgeous, yet lively and focused. Lovely 2017. The Argiano 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is a wine of considerable bandwidth with lots of dark fruit, rich plum and spice. It carries medium fruit weight and concentration that proves more than enough to surround and soften the spicy oak notes and toast that also play an important role in this hot-vintage Brunello. The results are plump and slightly round, but you also get the acidity and the tannic structure of an age-worthy Sangiovese. Organically farmed fruit is selected from across the best parcels of the estate, and some of the vines are up to 55 years old. Scents of crushed mint, woodland berries and new leather come to the forefront along with a whiff of violet. The full-bodied palate features cherry marinated in spirits, licorice and a hint of coffee bean alongside firm, refined tannins. Best after 2024 A rigid, tightly-wound version, this red features a core of cherry, raspberry, black currant, almond and iron aromas and flavors. Needs time, yet everything feels like they are in the right proportions. Finishes fresh, spicy and long. Best from 2025. "
169,Dashwood Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,Zealand,17,13,4.4,54,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Dashwood Sauvignon Blanc is racy on the palate and crisp in the finish. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of grapefruit, lemon peel, and chalky notes. Enjoy it with smoked mussels in a garlic wine broth. (Tasted: March 24, 2022, Rutherford, CA) On the vegetal and herbal side, this SB offers up a nose of green bell pepper, jalapeno and tomato stem with subtle citrus and passion fruit notes beneath. There's a wallop of acidity in the mouth but the juicy fruit holds its own, flowing through to the finish. Could be a tasty pairing with asparagus or a fresh leafy salad. Features vibrant and generous flavors of lemongrass, fresh ginger and pear, with notes of sea salt and toasted herb on the finish. "
170,Chateau Pape Clement,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,109,14.5,4.8,18,"Coming from 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc brought up in 60% new French oak, the 2018 Château Pape Clement from Bernard Magrez is a gorgeous wine that's performing even better from bottle than barrel, which is always a good sign. Deep ruby/purple, with stunning crème de cassis and blackberry fruits as well as kaleidoscope-like notes of graphite, scorched earth, smoke, violets, and spring flowers, it offers full-bodied richness yet stays light on its feet, graceful, and almost ethereal on the palate, with integrated acidity and building yet seamless tannin's. The Cabernet Sauvignon really sings at this point, and there's almost a Médoc-like regalness here. Reminding me of a slightly more elegant 2005 (it also has similarities to the 2016), it will benefit from 4-6 years in the cellar and keep for 30+ years. Aromas of wild blackberries, blueberries, dried lavender, cloves and eucalyptus with gravel and cocoa butter. It’s full-bodied with firm, powdery tannins. Polished and creamy with a core of ripe fruit that evolves to herbs, spices and chocolate. Fantastic concentration and seamless integration. Try from 2024. A warm mocha note drapes elegantly over a prodigious core of steeped red and black currant and blackberry fruit while waves of black tea, anise, fruitcake and applewood fill in on the finish. Structure is serious and well-imbedded. Really well put together. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2025 through 2038. I love watching how Pape Clement is evolving with every vintage. There's still a bit of Venice Beach in its muscles but it has let some juice in between the firm tannins and it's all the better for it. There are ripples of freshness here too, with lots of fleshy fruit, and a slatey mineral finish that sits against chocolate and smoked cedar notes. It's clearly been carefully extracted yet still has the serious ageing ability and sense of confidence that is the signature of the property. 37hl/ha yield in 2018. Two-thirds new oak. Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2018 Clémentin de Pape Clement strides confidently out of the glass with classic scents of ripe blackcurrants, juicy black plums and cedar chest, plus touches of graphite, bay leaves, unsmoked cigars and espresso. The medium-bodied, elegantly styled palate (13.5% alcohol) has a lot of grace and presence for a second wine, featuring finely grained tannins and seamless freshness to support the bright, black fruit flavors, finishing on a minerally note. "
171,Penfolds Bin 28 Shiraz,2020,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,38,14.5,3.9,11,"Ripe and generous, but the aromatics take this to the next level, with notes of cardamom, paprika and dried rose petal, plus touches of candied violet and cocoa powder, to complement the core of fleshy blackberry, black cherry and cassis. The tannins are dense but velvety, and this finishes with warm chocolaty notes. Sourced from vineyards in McLaren Vale, Barossa Valley, Padthaway and Clare Valley. Matured for 12 months in American hogsheads (16% new). Penfolds' team of winemakers have come up with an improbably fluid wine that has entirely unexpected elements of grace. All the components of fruit, oak, tannins and acidity – the last particularly important – are in synergistic union. A homage to warmer-region, South Australian shiraz, this has a rich and smooth delivery of ripe blackberries and red-to-dark plums on the nose. The wine has taken its 12 months in American oak (16% new) well and truly in its stride. Plush and suave mouth-feel here, this is effortless and a style that sits right in the Penfolds sweet spot. A blend of McLaren Vale, Barossa Valley, Padthaway and Clare Valley. Drink or hold. "
172,Clos des Papes Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,135,0,0.0,0,"A very Clos des Papes vintage,' says Vincent Avril, and I know what he means - a vintage that naturally delivers the kind of fresh, elegant wines that this estate is famous for. A tasting of several foudres point to a wine with natural, easy balance. The Mourvèdre is excellent here this year, and adds great depth to the fresh and delightful Grenache that has notes of black tea, black cherry and iron. Elegant and very fine. Beguiling, with a plume of black tea and incense leading off, followed by warmed black cherry reduction, cassis, melted black licorice, warm earth and singed tobacco and garrigue accents. Offers breadth and depth with a seamless feel, capped by a subtle mineral edge that lingers lengthily amid the beautiful fruit. Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre.  "
173,Martin Ray Synthesis Cabernet Sauvignon,2020,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,50,14.5,4.1,8,"Pretty aromas of blueberries, blackcurrants, cassis and mint chocolate. Light hazelnut character.

175,Chateau de Bligny Grande Reserve Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,France,65,12,4.4,19,"This Champagne rosé shows some good complexity on the nose with bread crust and brioche to match some dried cranberries and raspberries. Direct acidity frames the fine layering of bubbles. Ripe black cherry, plum and spice notes are framed by juicy acidity, fine texture and a chalky base note in this well-knit rosé. Very approachable as an aperitif, but with structure to match light dishes. "
176,Chateau Barde Haut,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,39,14.5,4.4,21,"Attractive black-fruit and berry character with some chocolate and toasted-hazelnut undertones. It’s full-bodied with chewy tannins and a juicy finish. Lots of flavor. Lots of polish. 80% merlot and 20% cabernet franc. Best from 2024. This beautiful estate is located on the eastern side of the appellation, and they consistently turn out brilliant wines. The 2019 Château Barde-Haut reveals a deep purple hue to go with classic limestone-influenced aromas and flavors of ripe black cherries, chalky minerality, chocolate, and white truffle. More medium to full-bodied and elegant than overtly powerful, its balance is spot on, it has beautiful tannins, and a great finish. It shows the vintage style perfectly and will benefit from 4-5 years of bottle age, and cruise for over two decades in cold cellars. Best after 2026. Juicy and ripe, offering a slightly burly-edged mix of plum, boysenberry and blackberry compote flavors laced with hints of licorice root and alder. Grippy, with adequate energy to the tar-lined finish. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. "
177,Louis Jadot Pouilly-Fuisse,2020,Chardonnay,France,31,12.84,4.0,43,"Crisp, fresh, and minerally, with great citrus fruit and racy
acidity. A lovely Burgundy at a good price. A silky, lemon-infused white, with a crisp structure and mineral component underneath. Flashes of peach and apple add depth as this converges on the pastry-inflected finish. "
178,Realm Cellars The Bard,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,159,0,4.0,32,"The 2018 The Bard is beautiful and certainly in the same realm as the 2015 and 2016, both magical wines. This cuvée reveals a deep purple color followed by a beautiful perfume of crème de cassis, blackberries, roasted coffee, spring flowers, and violets. With incredible richness, no hard edges, and a blockbuster finish, this incredible wine offers serious opulence with no sensation of heaviness or weight. It's beautifully done and already complex and nuanced. It will evolve for at least 15+ years.  The 2018 The Bard is fabulous and also one of the very finest wines I have ever tasted from Realm. Vertical structure, power and explosive energy infuse the 2018 with tremendous character. Inky dark fruit, chocolate, leather, licorice and lavender are some of the many notes that run through the 2018. This is the first vintage that includes a dollop of Petite Sirah from Bourn. It is also the first vintage in which a portion of the wine was aged in concrete eggs, which seems to add tension and a palpable sense of vibrancy. The Bard is a blend of 40 different lots, everything from Calistoga to Coombsville, a marriage of elements that works so well. Although none of these wines could be referred to as inexpensive, The Bard is a tremendous relative value within the context of high-end Napa Valley. I loved it. Intense and perfumed aromas of cassis, mulberry, lavender, nutmeg and cloves. Praline, walnuts and dark chocolate, too. It’s full-bodied, creamy and polished with a precise finish. Firm yet smoothly coating tannins. Very fine. "
179,La Rioja Alta Vina Alberdi Reserva Tinto,2018,Tempranillo,Spain,23,14.5,4.0,62,"A pretty nose of raspberries, cassis, fresh herbs, vanilla and sweet spices. It’s medium-bodied with round tannins. Creamy and fruity with chocolatey character on the mid-palate. Supple finish with excellent length. Tangy acidity. 100% tempranillo. Drink or hold. Their young and fresh red 2018 Viña Alberdi, already a Reserva (Crianza in Spain), matured in oak barrel for two years—in new barrels for the first year and in used barrels for the second year. During the élevage, they racked the wine manually from barrel to barrel four times. 2018 was a year of lower alcohol and more freshness in the wines, and they thought the wines were not designed for the long haul; so, they didn't produce any other wine, and so the only wine from 2018 IS VIÑA ALBERDI! Which means that all the Tempranillo grapes that were destined for 890, 904 and all the other wines went to this wine. They didn't use the Garnacha (which was sold in bulk). So, this is a super- Viña Alberdi, which shows more Crianza style in this cooler vintage but with very good depth and complexity, perhaps a more modern and fresher style. The wine has a seamless palate and a juicy texture, with more color than other vintages, more intensity, more fruit... It has grapes from very good vineyards and poor soils that were never destined for this wine. Highly recommendable and very versatile. It has potential to age. They produced a whopping one million bottles of it. It was bottled in March 2021. "
180,J. Lohr Estates Seven Oaks Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,16,13.9,4.1,231,"The addition of Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot, and Malbec along with dollops of Cab Franc and Syrah lend complexity to this easy drinker through vibrant aromatics and dense texture. Notes of ripe, juicy cherry as well as vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg intertwine with toasty sandalwood and tilled earth as roasted coffee infuses flavor into the supple tannins. Aged 12 months in 60-gallon American oak barrels. "
181,Eden Rift Terraces Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,California,55,13.9,4.4,30,"Green apple, green mango and flint on the nose with hints of almonds. This is so compact and polished with such energy and beauty. Phenolics spread across the palate and melt in. Great chardonnay. Drink or hold Lemon balm, light mint, acacia flower and a light hint of oak make for a very soothing nose on this bottling. The palate is chiseled in structure and vibrant, with penetrating acidity, combining flavors of lemon balm, sandalwood and toasted almond. The 2018 Chardonnay Terraces, from terraced vines planted in 1996, opens to delicate notes of crushed shell, chamomile and almonds on the nose, with soft notions of saline and green herbs. The palate is soft and understated, carried by bright acidity and mineral character, and it finishes long and uplifted. "
182,Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle No. 25 with Gift,Box,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,250,12,0.0,0,"A prestige Champagne with great density and depth, yet it remains compact and structured, with a combination of fine phenolics, acidity and extract. Lots of flavors of lemon rind, salt, mineral and honeysuckle with an attractive fresh-herb undertone. Then it turns to candied lemons with some ginger. A triumph in complexity and power. A blend of 2008, 2007 and 2006. 60% chardonnay and 40% pinot noir. 7g/L dosage. Drink or hold. Laurent-Perrier's imminently released NV Brut Grand Siècle #25 is showing beautifully, unwinding in the glass with an incipiently complex bouquet of pear, crisp stone fruit and mandarin mingled with hints of smoke, buttered toast and dried white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, layered and textural, with a fleshy core of fruit, terrific concentration and a racy spine of acidity, it's a deep, comparatively structured wine that will evolve beautifully in the cellar. As I've written before, this iteration is a blend of the 2008, 2007 and 2006 vintages, with 2008 lending #25 its depth and structure, 2007 contributing additional cut and 2006 additional richness. While the #25 exemplifies the seamless charm of this bottling, it's also one of the best propositions for long-term cellaring among recent renditions of Grand Siècle, and it will really reward time on cork. COMMENTARY: The Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle Iteration No. 25 deftly combines richness with finesse. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of tart apples, mineral notes, and a slight creaminess. Enjoy it with steamed Dungeness crab in a delicate white wine reduction sauce. (Tasted; March 1, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The newest release of Grand Siècle is based upon the superb and structured 2008 vintage (65% of the blend), along with the vivacious 2007 vintage (25%), and the creamy, luxurious 2006 (10%). The final blend is 60% Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs and 40% Pinot Noir from the Montagne de Reims. The result at this stage exhibits its Chardonnay character, with toasty notes of ripe pear and spice on the nose and a creamy, silky texture and an edge of citrus. Although elegant and refined at present, the underlying power will doubtless come to the fore with time. Dosage: 7g/L. Reveals rich and concentrated flavors of pear tart and dried mango, roasted hazelnut and ground coffee, preserved lemon and candied ginger enlivened by a spine of racy acidity and an underlying streak of minerally smoke and brine. Offers a fine and creamy mousse, with pleasing viscosity to the overall impression. Long, spiced finish. "
183,Chateau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande,2009,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,244,13,4.6,13,"A beautifully ripe, intense and concentrated red and black fruit aroma leads to a palate that's still closed, but those damson fruits are well brushed and of serious quality. This is going beat for beat with the top level wines in 2009 and it's utterly brilliant, delivering juice, minerality, power, balance, silky tannins, definition and sheer enjoyment. What a great nose of blackberries, currants and spices. Hints of fresh herbs. Full body, with ultra-fine tannins and lovely fruit. Such finesse and beauty. Wonderful to taste. Reminds me of the legendary 1982. Try in 2018. Offers a dark roasted core of plum sauce, warm fig paste, melted licorice and singed cedar, while a mouthwatering iron edge and a lovely smoldering tobacco note add lift and length through the finish. A touch restrained now, but should blossom with cellaring. Best from 2017 through 2033. "
184,Alexana Revana Vineyard Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,Oregon,65,13.5,0.0,0,"This vibrant red is coiled with tension, offering dynamic raspberry and blueberry flavors that gather notes of spiced cinnamon and orange oil, building toward medium-grained tannins. "

186,Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,199,0,4.3,5,"The wine of the vintage in Saint-Julien, if not all of the Médoc, the 2019 Château Ducru-Beaucaillou is based on 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot, aged in 100% new French oak, that hit a natural alcohol of 14.2% with a monster IPT (number of tannins) of 88. It's certainly one of the most concentrated Saint-Juliens, revealing a dense purple hue to go with a stacked bouquet of crème de cassis, freshly sharpened pencils, damp clay, tobacco, and hints of spring flowers. Concentrated, full-bodied, and powerful, it has incredible tannins, flawless balance, and a gorgeous finish. While most estates today are playing it safe and producing more ethereal, elegant wines that drink well right out of the gate, thankfully, this estate continues to make concentrated, powerful, age-worthy wines, and this heavenly beauty is as good as it gets! It will need a decade of bottle age to hit the early stages of maturity and will evolve for 50 years or more. Bravo to Bruno Borie! Best After 2032 This is so seductive on the nose, with perfumes of violets, blackcurrants, raspberries, and orange peel. Subtle. Ethereal.

There is plenty of youthful Howell Mountain tannin, so readers will have to be patient. Bright floral accents lift the red/purplish berry fruit nicely. This is such an expressive, alluring Cabernet. Ripe and very juicy, with a youthfully compact set of plum, boysenberry and blackberry compote flavors wrapped in licorice and violet notes. This is both racy and grippy, showing serious power but with the freshness and drive to match. Delivers a long, iron accent that scores the fruit through the finish. Best from 2024. "

Medium-bodied with a relatively light but firm tannin framework. The flavors remain enticing and fresh. The lighter overall structure reflects the vintage, but there’s room for expansion here, given time. Moving over to Novello, the Paolo Scavino 2018 Barolo Ravera is slightly more simplistic in this vintage with a tart cherry element that opens loud over the bouquet. You might also notice crushed white pepper, salty limestone and crushed earth. The wine remains subtle in texture with silky tannins and medium weight. Best After 2024 "

of their rosé (this one includes 30 percent cinsault and 15 percent grenache), and, though 2021 was another hot summer here, Romassan’s poor
limestone and sandstone soils produced a deeply savory wine. This pale Bandol seems to have inhaled the local scrubland and seaside breezes,
presenting that savory edge alongside husk cherry, grapefruit and pale melon flavors. Firm and versatile, it would pair nicely with anything from
bouillabaisse to a Niçoise salad; or take it abroad alongside chicken yakitori.- Seamlessly stitches together jasmine, pink grapefruit, tangerine, rose water and a savory accent, with a subtle twinge of fleur de sel adding a counterpoint to the lengthy finish. Graceful, but with nice underlying tension throughout. Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah and Mourvèdre. Drink now. "

Crisp acidity defines this well-knit rosé, making a counterpoint to the lightly plush texture of the creamy mousse, with flavors of steeped raspberry, orange peel and pickled ginger showing a hint of smoke on the finish.

A subtle savory edge winds through the finish, which lingers prettily. Drink now. Heitz's 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon is predominantly St. Helena fruit, but it includes grapes from other AVAs as well.

Opening in the glass with notions of rich berry fruit, licorice, cedar, violets and loamy soil, the 2019 Cantemerle is medium to full-bodied, with a fleshy core of fruit, lively acids and powdery tannins that gently assert themselves on the finish.

213,Domaine du Pegau Chateauneuf-du-Pape Cuvee Reservee,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,89,14.5,0.0,0,"This youthful Chateauneuf has a very complex nose of graphite, raw meat and lilies. With aeration the black-cherry note steadily grows in intensity. Bold, leathery and earthy palate with fine tannins that build steadily on at the extremely long and straight mineral finish. Drinkable now, but best from 2024. Dark and brooding, this has serious heft, with tightly coiled plum reduction and black licorice offset by savory tea, menthol, smoked meat and iodine. A great example of an old-school style, with mineral intensity building and salty iron and grippy tannins carrying the finish. Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. Best from 2024. "
214,Massolino Vigna Parussi Barolo,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,99,14.5,0.0,0,"Blue flower, ripe dark-skinned fruit, cedar and forest floor aromas shape the nose. Delicious and firmly structured, the full-bodied palate also shows finesse, delivering juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry and licorice alongside fine-grained, enveloping tannins. Franco Massolino’s success in the 2017 vintage isn’t limited to his Serralunga crus. This vibrant wine from Castiglione Falletto shows flavors of juicy red cherry and raspberry laced together by taut, ferrous tannins. Notes of licorice, menthol and fresh rose petals add even more lift and detail to the wine. Sourced from a 1.3-hectare parcel of Parussi in Castiglione Falletto, the 2017 Barolo Parussi is fresh with chalky mineral earth, red cherry, dried roses, and cedar. Ripe and vibrant, with dried raspberry leather, apricot, and sweet herbs, there are powerful tannins that balance the fruit. These are wines that need time to show their true potential and I think will be worth the wait. Drink 2025-2050. With fruit from Castiglione Falletto, the Massolino 2017 Barolo Parussi is a standout in this portfolio of wines mainly from Serralunga d'Alba. Thanks to its protective positioning at the center of the appellation where it draws upon the soils and exposures of the surrounding areas, Castiglione Falletto performs very nicely in a vintage that saw extreme weather with frost and drought. What the Parussi brings to the table is more focus and sharpness, with red fruits, crushed rose, cooling limestone mineral and some dried mint. This is supple and juicy, offering cherry, strawberry, floral and tea flavors. Elements of mineral and tobacco chime in as this builds nicely to the long, energetic finish. Shows excellent balance and potential. "
215,Chappellet Pritchard Hill Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,325,14.5,0.0,0,"A blend of 95% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Pritchard Hill is another wonderfully evocative triumph from this family-owned Pitchard Hill pioneer. Deep garnet-purple colored, it storms out of the glass with profound scents of crème de cassis, blackberry preserves, licorice and mulberries, plus hints of unsmoked cigars, wild sage and tar. The medium to full-bodied palate delivers fantastic intensity and great poise, offering fine-grained, ripe tannins and bold freshness, finishing long and mineral laced. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Chappellet Pritchard Hill Cabernet Sauvignon is wine on its one plateau of excellence.

Full-bodied with plush, integrated tannins that are intertwined to pure velvet. The finish goes on and on. Wonderful balance and harmony. 2022 release. So excellent to drink now, but will be even better in 2023 and onwards. Seriously fruit-laden, showing warmed cassis, plum sauce and blackberry compote flavors that are layered seamlessly, with a plush structure underneath and a backdrop of singed vanilla, sweet tobacco, violet and mocha.

216,Leeuwin Estate Art Series Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,Australia,94,13.5,0.0,0,"The 2019 Art Series Chardonnay is rich and savory but pure and saline too. There is white peach, red apples, curry leaf and brine. The way the flavor moves across the palate is testament to the phenolics that course through the wine; it’s all at a perfect intersect of fruit power, tannin and perfectly judged acidity. The flavor stains the palate and lingers in an unravelling spool of thread in the mouth long after the wine has gone. A stupendously good wine. Leeuwin Art Series Chardonnay on release is an achingly painful thing to drink, because once you've known the utter pleasure these wines bring at 5 or more years of age, it becomes a mess of cognitive dissonance to drink them so young. They are closed, taut, coiled, but more than anything, populated by rippling fruit that undulates untold through the interminably long finish. They typically don't reveal their kaleidoscopic spice and prismatic fruit flavour until a little further down the track. So, all I can humbly do here, is place the vintage in context. Through the lens of the cool year, this glitters with a purity and finesse that is deeply attractive. Aligned in style with the 2017. This has inviting aromas of white grapefruits, peach pits, lime curd, white flowers and some freshly grated nutmeg. Scallop and oyster shells, too. Medium-bodied, elegant yet powerful, with creamy and phenolic layers and delicious saline and flinty edges. "
217,Lucien Le Moine Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru,2017,Pinot Noir,France,450,0,0.0,0,"A lithe, refined red, this features black currant, pomegranate, stone and toasty oak flavors aligned with a lean, intense frame.

Full-bodied and layered, with iron and strawberry at the end. Drink now. The latest rendition of Ruinart's NV Brut Rosé is a pretty, vibrant wine that offers up inviting aromas of tangerine, blood orange, plum and freshly baked bread.

TASTING NOTES: This wine excels in all categories—aroma, flavors, balance, concentration, and style. It offers aromas and flavors of extracted black fruit, hints of licorice, oak, and other still to be revealed nuances. Give it time in the cellar before popping its cork. (Tasted: June 25, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Generous aromatics of dark berry fruit, caramel, and spice are clear indicators of a warm vintage, but there are also floral notes and no heaviness whatsoever. There is juicy, savoury substance on the palate, sustained by gossamer tannins of surprising delicacy, but lurking underneath is the power so characteristic of this vintage. A few years of cellaring will be needed for the terroir expression to hit its stride. A very polished and pure expression of Pauillac, but don't go to sleep on it. As charming and vibrant as the cassis, cherry preserve and blackberry paste flavors are, they have a latent saturated feel. And then there's a serious network of iron girders supporting it all, along with sweet tobacco, floral and worn cedar accents. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Best from 2030 through 2050.

Aromas of ripe raspberries and dark spice follow through to a medium-to full-bodied palate, with some fine, fruit and spice-coated tannin and a medium finish that firms up at the end. A taut, sinewy red, this keeps cherry, strawberry, floral and underbrush flavors under a wrap of tannins for now. Overall, the components are well-proportioned, and this ends with complexity, harmony and length.  Albe is GD Vajra’s most classic Barolo in the sense that it is a blend of multiple sites: Coste di Vergne, La Volta and Fossati are all within the township of Barolo and sit at high altitudes. This wine is characterised by its pretty, becoming aromas and smooth suppleness. Alpine herbs and white pepper lace the predominantly floral profile and the palate is replete with crunchy summer berries. Don’t hesitate to pull the cork of this affable Barolo. "

It's another impeccably made, clean, crisp, juicy white that's going to shine with just about any food out there. "
247,Ruinart Brut Blanc de,Blancs,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,109,12.5,4.6,189,"A toasty blanc de blanc with an aromatic overtone of smoke and lemon peel notes accenting flavors of poached apricot, brioche, passion fruit coulis and fresh thyme. Fine and creamy in texture, with a racy finish. Best after 2022. COMMENTARY: The Ruinart Blanc de Blancs has always been one of our household favorites, and the current cuvée is alluring and pleasing from start to finish. TASTING NOTES: This wine is refined, steady, and attractive, with aromas and flavors of tart and ripe apple and a hint of spice. Enjoy it with ikura sashimi appetizers. (Tasted: July 14, 2022, Menlo Park, CA) With its 100% Chardonnay, this Champagne is finely textured, elegant with minerality and the freshest crispest apple flavors. It does have some weight and certainly has intensity—a satisfying, textured wine that is ready to drink. A fruity yet firm blanc de blancs with some brioche, cooked-apple and pear aromas and flavors. Full-bodied and flavorful. Fruity finish. Always a good bottle. Drink now. Creamy in its gentle texture, this has the floral scent of hops and the sweet citrus tang of oranges. A subtle aperitif. Récoltant-Manipulant in Avize (Côte des Blancs) founded in 1947 owns 10 acres of chardonnay average vine age: 45 years oldest vines: 70+ years. "
248,Chateau Canon La Gaffeliere,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,109,14.5,4.5,44,"The aromas are very complex with sweet tobacco, black truffles, blueberries and blackberries. Subtle. Menthol, too. Full-bodied yet so elegant. Structure with finesse and purity. The tannins are melted in the wine. Fabulous young wine. Try tasting it from 2023. The 2016 Canon La Gaffelière is just as striking from bottle as it was from barrel. Bright, intensely aromatic and precise, the 2016 has it all. Sweet red cherry, pomegranate, blood orange and rose petal all race through this silky, super-expressive Saint-Émilion. In 2016, Canon La Gaffelière is especially polished, refined and nuanced, which means also less overly powerful than in the past. It was compelling both times I tasted it from bottle. Bold tannins, rich fruit and good acidity combine in a wine that is powerful while always fresh. With acidity and stylish black-currant flavors, the wine’s fruitiness comes through the tannins, finishing with a juicy, perfumed aftertaste. Best after 2025. This delivers a very fresh, juicy ball of red and black currant preserve flavors laced liberally with bramble, roasted apple wood and sweet tobacco notes. Shows terrific purity, energy and drive, with a piercing echo of minerality through the mouthwatering finish. Best from 2022 through 2038. One of the most elegant and seamless wines in the vintage is the 2016 Canon-la-Gaffelière, a blend of 55% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Franc, and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon brought up in 60% new French oak. This medium to full-bodied beauty has brilliant minerality as well as tons of cassis fruits, notions of spice box, cedarwood, licorice, and dried earth, silky tannins, no hard edges, and a great, great finish. It shows the purity and elegance of the vintage to a T. Drink this fabulous Saint-Emilion any time over the coming 20+ years. Another successful wine in St-Émilion, with the signature of careful extraction. Well-brushed black fruits and a lovely push-and-pull effect between supple tannins, rich fruits and fresh acidity. Certified organic since the 2014 vintage. Drinking Window 2027 - 2045 Leading with a lovely, slightly sweet nose of red cherries and hardwoods and showing both a certain degree of elegance as well as an augmented sense of continuing fruity richness in its fairly bright and lively young flavors, this rich and yet decidedly graceful wine is predisposed more to polish than power. That said, it is no shrinking violet and has energy to spare as well as the silky, very fine tannins to warrant at least another five to eight years of keeping. "
249,La Rioja Alta Vina Arana Rioja Gran Reserva,2014,Tempranillo,Spain,43,13.5,4.0,111,"Arana commemorates one of La Rioja Alta's historic families. The Tempranillo (95%) and Graciano (5%) are aged separately in American oak barrels for three years before blending, then for three years in bottle (two years less than the 904, and six years less than the 890). The winery's keynote to this Rioja is 'freshness'. I agree. The aim with the 2014 Viña Arana Gran Reserva is to find a new Gran Reserva style that combines freshness and joy with intensity, sophistication and aging potential through a blend of Tempranillo with 6% Graciano that matured in American oak barrels for three years with rackings every six months. 2014 was a weaker year in the region, and the wine shows it and feels less vivacious than the 2015 Viña Alberdi. It has medium ripeness and abundant spicy and smoky notes and a medium-bodied palate with a soft texture that points at a wine for shorter-term consumption than the rest of the portfolio or other vintages from this cuvée. "
250,Drappier Carte d'Or,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,49,12,4.3,156,"Disgorged in April 2021, Drappier's new NV Brut Carte d'Or delivers attractive aromas of golden orchard fruit, stone fruit, honeycomb and white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, it's charming and elegantly vinous, with a flavorful core of fruit, lively acids and a chalky finish. This has aromas of pear tart, pie crust, praline and apricot. Bright, with a creamy mousse and attractive biscuity and nutty layers. Dry feel at the end. 80% pinot noir, 15% chardonnay and 5% pinot meunier. Dosage 5,5 g/L. Unfiltered. Drink now. The NV Champagne Carte d’Or Brut is 75% Pinot Noir, 15% Pinot Meunier, and the remainder Chardonnay, with 6.5 grams per liter dosage. There is 80% base wine from the 2019 vintage and the remainder reserve wine. This is their historical style, with the nose offering up aromas of ripe apricot, yellow flowers, and cherry liqueur. The palate is round and a bit more structured, with more stone fruit and kirsch. Best after 2022. A bright Champagne in an aperitif style, with a pleasing range of ripe currant and raspberry, lime blossoms and orange peel set on a zesty bead. Creamy finish. Drink now.  "
251,Casanova di Neri Brunello di Montalcino Cerretalto,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,419,15,4.9,5,"Cerretalto is bottled separately in selected vintages only. It is given an additional year of ageing and is typically still patently austere when released. While the 2015 was almost uncharacteristically fleshy, 2016 is a return to Cerretalto’s sinewy personality. It opens gradually with distinct flint, creosote and smoke-infused wild black currants and thyme. The palate is powerful without being weighty, with chiselled tannins that are rigid but not hard-edged. A concentrated core of black salted liquorice, black raspberry and iron is pierced by tangy acidity. Ultimately an elegant wine, this will need time to express all its nuance.
Drinking Window 2025 - 2045 Here's an important keepsake from a classic vintage. The Casanova di Neri 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Cerretalto needs time to open, especially if you plan to drink the wine earlier than is recommended (you're best off waiting five years or more). This powerful wine is packed tight with black fruit, plum and summer ripe cherry. Those dark fruit tones segue to spice, baked clay, balsam herb and gardening soil. The oak is always more apparent in the Cerretalto (which is released one year later, as if it were a Riserva) compared to the Tenuta Nuova. The vineyard used makes a big difference, giving this wine more textural weight and thicker fiber. It's all a question of taste, but if you want power (with 15% alcohol), richness, sensuality and voluptuousness in your Brunello, Cerretalto is the bottle at the end of the rainbow. Best after 2025. A dense, racy and expressive red, offering black cherry, black currant, violet, iron and a hint of rosemary aromas and flavors. This is driven by vivid acidity and refined tannins, which lend both finesse and length. Features great harmony and elegance. Best from 2025. "
252,Castello di Monsanto Chianti Classico Riserva,2018,Sangiovese,Italy,31,0,4.3,51,"Cedar, dried flowers, cherries and spices on the nose. Medium-to full-bodied with very polished, refined tannins and excellent length. This has gorgeous structure. Needs two or three years to soften. Excellent potential. Try after 2023. The 2018 Chianti Classico Riserva is a bold powerful wine. Black cherry, iron, tar, menthol and licorice give the 2018 a super-distinctive, wild profile. There is plenty of depth and volume. In 2018, the Riserva offers a decidedly wild, gamy expression of Sangiovese. Best of all, the Riserva remains a fabulous value. A straightforward red, offering cherry, strawberry and light earth flavors on an open-knit profile, with moderate length. Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Colorino. "
253,Krug Grande Cuvee Brut (375ML,half-bottle),Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,139,0,4.5,49,"A lovely ferny nose and breezy seaside raciness. Bright yellow fruit on entry, a flicker of preserved lemon and cooked quince adding vibrancy. Then comes the Krug richness which spreads over the palate. The balance hovers tantalisingly between tactile precision and soft warm fruit and the finish reveals layers of cinnamon-tinctured blancmange, and the creaminess goes on. Rich but light on its feet. A definite buy and a keeper. The 2014 base harvest was hit by sour rot and mildew in mid-summer. Intense selection meant Krug had to reduce the amount of Meunier to half its Grande Cuvée average, and reserve wines (representing 45% of the final wine) back to 1998 buttress the balance and complexity; a triumph of blending. It also relies heavily on 2013 to add life and structure. Wonderful precision and depth right away on the nose, with dried pineapple, light apricot and hints of flint and slate. Medium-bodied palate that’s firm, bright and linear. Vivid,driven acidity adds focus and perfection. Dried lemon and a wonderful, creamy texture with a mineral undertone. Extremely long, almost endless. Sophistication here. Drink or hold. A lovely, mouthwatering Champagne, with a vivid and finely detailed panoply of baked nectarine, lime blossom, ground coffee, mandarin orange peel, candied ginger and salted almond notes set in a lithe, limber frame. Seamlessly knit, with a sense of buoyant vitality, this has a harmonious, elegant frame for the richly expressive flavor range. Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Meunier. Disgorged winter 2020 to 2021. Drink now through 2027. Krug's NV Grande Cuvée 170ème Édition is based on the 2014 vintage, complemented by some 45% reserve wines dating back to 1998, with the house drawing on, among many others, 2013 for structure and 2012 and 2003 for generosity. Opening in the glass with aromas of pastry cream, dried fruits, pear, warm spices, freshly baked bread and vanilla pod, it's medium to full-bodied, pillowy and fine-boned, with excellent concentration, racy acids and a precise, chiseled profile. But if the latter adjective could be applied to the 2013-base 169ème édition equally felicitously, the 2014-base 170ème is more giving and less tightly wound out of the gates and will offer more demonstrative drinking young.

259,Catena Alta Malbec,2018,Malbec,Argentina,55,14,4.1,28,"The 2018 Catena Alta Malbec shows more evolution and ripeness than the 2019. It's varietal and floral with a mixture of red and black fruit, sweet spices and aromatic herbs. It has moderate ripeness—in fact, it's a little lower in alcohol than the 2019—a medium body and fine-grained tannins, with good grip.  Well-structured and juicy, with dark cherry and plum tart flavors that feature firm tannins and acidity. The spicy finish offers baker's chocolate notes and peppery hints. "
260,Bodegas Muga Reserva,2018,Tempranillo,Spain,33,14.5,4.2,53,"This was the only red that Muga made in 2018, and the wines from the best vineyards went into the blend. In other words, top vineyards were declassified. Medium-bodied with very fine tannins that are caressing and refined. Plenty of subtle berries, chocolate and walnuts. The 2018 Muga Reserva is a similar blend and has pretty, slightly fresher notes of darker, almost blue fruits as well as violets, spring flowers, and cedary oak. More medium-bodied on the palate, it shows the fresher, elegant style of the vintage, has beautiful tannins, no hard edges, and outstanding length on the finish. "

264,Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle No.,25,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,250,12,0.0,0,"A prestige Champagne with great density and depth, yet it remains compact and structured, with a combination of fine phenolics, acidity and extract.

276,Chateau Haut-Brion,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,809,14,4.2,20,"Stunning black fruit with plenty of forest berries in there, the whole picture cool and very delicate, also on the concentrated and highly structured palate. The tannins are very fine-grained, but decisively austere and, together with the vibrant acidity, they propel the finish out towards infinity and leave a breathtaking final impression. A blend of 56 per cent merlot, 37.5 per cent cabernet sauvignon and 6.5 per cent cabernet franc. Very long aging potential, but you could try it in 2023. The 2016 Haut-Brion is blended of 56% Merlot, 37.5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6.5% Cabernet Franc. Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the nose is at once profound and arresting, offering drop-dead gorgeous Morello cherries, lilacs and red rose scents with a core of Black Forest cake, warm blackcurrants and blueberry preserves plus wafts of sandalwood and underbrush. Medium-bodied, the elegantly crafted palate is completely packed with intense floral, mineral and cassis-laced flavors with a firm frame of very finely pixelated tannins and seamless freshness, finishing very long and achingly stunning. This has a little more reticence initially on the nose than La Mission, but after a few minutes the rich texture begins to reveal itself, with charcoal, tobacco, dark plum and damson fruits that are straining at the leash. It has hidden power and subtle oak toasting - this clearly feels no need to shout about its presence, but there will be plenty to discover over time. You can feel those tannins licking around your teeth, building up one layer at a time. A great wine En primeur that has settled into greatness. Large and in charge, this has a prodigious core of steeped plum, black currant and loganberry fruit flavors that show
both compote and coulis aspects. While that steeps, this delivers a sturdy frame of roasted mesquite, smoldering
tobacco and incense, surrounding a muscular spine of worn cedar and tar. Still rather backward, this will be showing
well when most others from the vintage have had their day. Best from 2025 through 2045. "
277,BenMarco Malbec,2020,Malbec,Argentina,20,14.5,4.8,24,"Nimble blackberries and sweet blueberries, minerals, graphite and black chocolate on the nose. This is a beautifully poised red with a linear, medium-bodied palate. Polished and driven. Delicious now. Drink or hold. "
278,Chateau Leoville Barton,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,169,13,4.2,61,"Terrific intensity of dark berries, almost peppery blackcurrants and violets with attractive and integrated, spicy oak and an earthy edge. The palate has a super powerful and long, linear core with plenty of fruit flesh strapped in tight for a long and thrilling ride into the finish. A blend of 86 per cent cabernet and 14 per cent merlot. Try from 2024. This is so vivid as it brims with pastis-soaked plum, blackberry, black currant and blueberry paste flavors, all carried by a perfectly integrated brambly spine. Tar and ganache notes give the finish an extra kick while everything stays within the mouthwatering roasted apple wood frame. Both regal and rambunctious, this is St.-Julien to a T. Best from 2025 through 2040. A brilliant young wine, the 2016 Léoville Barton unwinds in the glass with aromas of cassis, dark berries and cigar box mingled with subtle hints of loamy soil. Medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, it's seamless and exquisitely balanced, with beautifully refined tannins, bright acids and a long, penetrating finish. Its structural refinement is such that it's far from forbidding to open right now, yet patience will be richly rewarded. This vintage is dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, making it comparable to some top Pauillacs. The Barton family has owned these vineyards for centuries and always makes very fine claret, but this is exceptional. Opulent and vibrant nose, crammed with blackcurrant. Depth, grip and concentration, but balanced and stylish too, with notable freshness. For the long haul. Drinking Window 2024 - 2045 "
279,Andrew Murray Tous les Jours Syrah,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,California,25,14.5,3.8,119,"Another value release from this terrific producer, the 2018 Syrah Tous Les Jours is all Syrah, from a mix of vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley, that was mostly destemmed and brought up in neutral oak. It's deeper ruby/purple hue is followed by a ripe, textured, yet still complex, cool-climate-like Syrah that has lots of peppery herbs, smoke game, and assorted darker berry fruit aromas and flavors. It's California's answer to a terrific Saint Joseph and will evolve nicely for 4-6 years or more. "
280,Tolpuddle Vineyard Pinot Noir,2021,Pinot Noir,Australia,85,13.5,0.0,0,"I love the transparent, floral nose of this beautifully crafted and extremely fresh Tasmanian pinot noir. Fantastic interplay of mineral acidity with fresh black cherry and ripe strawberry fruit on the super-elegant palate. Long, silky and citrusy finish. From the Coal River Valley sub-region of Tasmania.  "
281,Ridge Monte Bello,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,249,13.7,4.2,6,"This is a very powerful Monte Bello with currants and blackberry, black licorice and smoked meat. Mint. Some sesame seed, too. It's full-bodied with incredible darkness and saltiness like volcanic salt. Umami. Grilled seaweed. Flavorful and captivating. It goes on for minutes. Best After 2025 COMMENTARY: Head Winemaker & COO John Olney wrote, ""During blind tastings of the 2019 Monte Bello, a record forty-one separate lots were assembled to create this vintage."" This painstaking process is just one of the reasons why this wine is so iconic. The 2019 Ridge Monte Bello is an outstanding wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of bold blackberries, other ripe fruits, and a lovely oak complement. Give it time in the cellar and pair it with a grilled, well-marbled ribeye. (Tasted: September 16, 2022, Cupertino, CA) The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Monte Bello is a more Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot, and the balance Cabernet Franc, all hitting 13.7% alcohol. As usual, it was aged in new American oak. It shows the higher Cabernet component and is deep purple-hued and tight and closed, with a primordial vibe to its dark blue and black fruit, smoked tobacco, vanilla bean, graphite, and cedarwood aromatics. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has terrific overall balance, building, ripe tannins, a good sense of freshness, and outstanding length. It reminds me slightly of the 2018 with its more elegant, streamlined profile, but I expect this to build with bottle age, and it should have 2-3 decades of overall longevity. Ever true to its stripes, Ridge has given us one of the most mannerly Merlots in this set of tastings. The wine is medium-full in weight yet attractively deep in flavor, and while it has a fair supply of tannins, it is more supple than it is astringent in palate-feel. Its fruit runs to varietal red cherries, and that fruit is backed up by a very well-proportioned sweet oak presence. If the wine admittedly tightens and narrows ever so slightly at the finish, it is only to remind us that a few years of further cellaring are in order. "
282,Chalk Hill Sonoma Coast Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,California,18,14.1,3.6,18,"Presents pear drop, Fuji apple, ripe Bartlett pear and lemon blossom details that are elegant and restrained, but they weave in and out on a light, fresh frame that's quite impressive. Gains a savory element, thanks to a touch of toasted sesame seed. Drink now. "
283,Sonnet Black Ridge Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,California,45,13.9,0.0,0,"Rich aromas of black cherry are doused in oak on the nose of this bottling. There's a ton of woodspice on the palate, where oak frames the roasted red fruit and clove flavors. "
284,Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc,2022,Sauvignon Blanc,Zealand,33,13.5,0.0,0,"Lime peel, sliced green pears, hints of asparagus and lemons. It's bright and crisp with a medium body. Refreshing, showing restraint and focus. Drink now.  "
285,WillaKenzie Estate Willamette Valley Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,Oregon,38,13.9,4.1,31,"Captures the best of Willamette Valley, with a layered structure that’s crisp yet supple with plump raspberry, orange peel and Darjeeling accents that glide toward refined tannins. "
286,Opaque Darkness Red Wine,2018,Other Red Blends,California,30,14.9,4.5,38,"Blackberry jam aromas meet with mahogany and cedar on the nose of this bottling. The wood-spice elements carry to the palate and pick up tobacco as well as black plum flavors, with an ample serving of brown spice. "
287,Leonetti Merlot,2020,Merlot,Washington,109,14.6,0.0,0,"Aromas of fleshy plum, blackberry and fresh mint. Full-bodied with tight tannins. Rich and cozy on the palate with an array of ripe, dark fruit. Layered and plush. Nice depth here. Fresh in the center palate. Best after 2024. Always bottled early, the 2020 Merlot is all varietal from a mix of sites in the Walla Walla Valley. It has a juicy, medium to full-bodied, chewy style on the palate as well as good purity in its ripe red and blue fruits, notes of tobacco, scorched earth, and graphite-like aromatics. It has some grippy, chalk tannins, and while rock-solid today, it's not a wine to hide away in the cellar. "
288,Chateau Leoville Las Cases,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,269,14.02,4.2,6,"The 2019 Léoville Las Cases is a brilliant young wine that will delight Bordeaux purists. Unwinding in the glass with scents of cassis, dark berries, cigar wrapper and pencil shavings, it’s full-bodied, layered and tightly wound, with a deep core of fruit, lively acids and an abundance of rich, powdery tannins. Concentrated and serious, much like its immediate neighbor Château Latour, it is likely to emerge as one of the vintage’s longest lived—and greatest—wines. Best After 2035 Remarkably sleek and pure, considering the generally burly and obvious tannic profile of the vintage. Delivers a pure and unadulterated beam of cassis and plum reduction flavors inlaid seamlessly with a glistening iron girder that seems to have no endpoint through the finish, where violet, anise and black tea notes shimmer. Reserved overall, with a beautiful austerity, this is an example of how great terroir always shines through—even in extreme years. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2030. More backward, deep, and layered, the Grand Vin 2019 Château Léoville Las Cases is 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc that saw 90% new French oak. Just awesome aromatics of pure crème de cassis, graphite, tobacco leaf, burning embers, and gravelly earth all soar from the glass. This is followed by a quintessential Léoville Las Cases that's medium to full-bodied, pure, concentrated, and regal on the palate, with beautiful tannins. The purity of fruit is spot on, it's flawlessly balanced, and it’s going to age for decades. While it offers pleasure today, I'd wager it will take 10-15 years to hit maturity and will be a 50+ year wine. Best after 2022. Rating: 97+ "
289,Alvear Pedro Ximenez 1927 (375ML,half-bottle),Other Dessert,Spain,34,16,4.3,298,"The NV Pedro Ximenez Solera 1927 is non-vintage, but does have some 1927 material in it. This is totally dark brown/amber with notes of figs, toffee, caramel syrup, molasses and coffee. It is dense, super sweet, intense, rich and an amazingly, unctuously textured, thick beverage to consume slowly and introspectively after a meal. Drink now through 2050, or even longer. COMMENTARY: The Alvear Solera 1927 Pedro Ximénez offers a decadent wine experience. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers complexities that few wines can. Its aromas and flavors of crushed nuts, iodine, and chalk nicely balance out the wine's brown sugar sweetness. Serve with banana bread topped with molasses and walnuts. (Tasted: July 21, 2020, San Francisco, CA) The 2015 Alvear Pedro Ximénez de Añada is another beauty. Made from sun-dried Pedro Ximénez grapes that were fermented and aged in large clay jars, it reveals a ruby/amber color as well as a great nose of orange liqueur, brown sugar, honeyed figs, and flowers. Uber-full-bodied, thick, and vicious, it’s a dessert wine geared for tiny sips. It will probably age forever. A raisiny, plum pudding-like nose with a wealth of brown-tea aromas. The palate has a sweet, rich and fleshy sultana and raisin finish. Drink now. "
290,Grgich Hills Estate Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,79,14.2,0.0,0,"Plenty of blackcurrants, flowers and sandalwood on the nose, following through to a full body with tight, creamy tannins that give the wine polish and beauty. Give it a year or two to soften, but already very attractive. From organically grown grapes. Try after 2022. "
291,Caymus Special Selection Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,219,15.7,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 Caymus Special Selection Cabernet Sauvignon is powerful and lasting on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of bold black fruit and complementary oaky nuances. (Tasted: December 11, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "
292,Massolino Barbera d'Alba,2020,Barbera,Italy,29,0,4.7,6,"The 2020 Barbera d'Alba is laced with refreshing red berry fruit, spice and floral notes. This mid-weight, silky Barbera is all pleasure and class. The gracious style is hugely appealing. This is the sort of wine that is opened and disappears in an instant. "
293,Masi Costasera Amarone Classico,2017,Other Red Blends,Italy,59,15,0.0,0,"A really fresh and well-balanced Amarone here, with tapenade, ripe but fresh blackberries, chili chocolate and some red berries, too. This is tight and juicy, with a medium-to full-bodied palate and a long, fruity finish. A modern, fresh expression of Amarone that shows immense drinkability, but still pretty serious. Not super-concentrated, but shows restraint and balance. Drink or hold. The wine is quite reserved on the nose to start, but with a decant it opens up nicely. The wine has aromas of red-cherry preserve, ripe plum, clove, anise and cinnamon. The palate is elegant with notes of dried leaves, dark chocolate and dark cherries. The tannins are already well integrated, giving the wine a magni??cent texture. Expect to enjoy this for a while Best from 2025–2035. "
294,Gruet,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,U.S.,17,12,4.1,522,"Smooth with generous fruit and fine bubbles: fresh, juicy, and clean with a tangy style; a delightful wine and an amazing value. COMMENTARY: The Gruet Brut is steady as it flows nicely on the palate into a crisp finish. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of ripe apples with a hint of floral notes and minerality. Enjoy it with light appetizers at the beginning of a grand dinner. (Tasted: December 20, 2022, San Francisco, CA) This sleek sparkler is expressive with its floral apple and toasty cinnamon aromas and crisp, layered flavors of lime
and mineral. "
295,Chateau Angelus,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,349,14.5,0.0,0,"Redcurrants, sweet tobacco and flowers with some sandalwood. Very perfumed and floral. So pure. Full-bodied, yet so refined and layered, with a soft, compact palate and a crushed-velvet mouth-feel. Poised fruit at the end, together with fresh, rare wood and a light chocolate undertone to the aftertaste. This is open, yet there’s so much in reserve. 60% merlot and 40% cabernet franc. Leave it in the cellar for at least eight years. Best after 2029. Based on a final blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc, the 2019 Château Angélus is knockout stuff, and while I'm not sure it matches the perfect 2018, it's not far off. Gorgeous notes of redcurrants, blueberries, sandalwood, dried flowers, vanilla, and forest floor are just some of its nuances, and it hits the palate with medium to full body, a perfectly balanced, seamless mouthfeel, beautifully ripe tannins, and a great, great finish. It doesn't have the sheer weight or richness of, say, the 1998, 2000, 2005, or even the 2009, but it doesn't lack for intensity or power, and it’s just a beautiful example of modern-day Saint-Emilion. It's already approachable (this was best on day two) yet will keep for another 30+ years. Best after 2022. The 2019 Angélus bursts from the glass with a rich, dramatic nose of cherries, licorice, sweet spices and dark chocolate. Full-bodied, layered and vibrant, its broad and velvety attack segues into a layered, concentrated mid-palate that's underpinned by tangy acids and fine, powdery tannins, concluding with a long, penetrating finish. It's a blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc. Its seamless, pure profile reflects the subtle shift chez Angélus away from the rich, toasty style of the 1990s and 2000s toward greater elegance and precision. Best after 2026. "
296,Kendall-Jackson Estates Collection Santa Maria Valley Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,35,14.5,4.1,15,"The 2020 Chardonnay Estates Collection Santa Maria Valley is vinous with notes of pine resin, yellow apple, and chamomile. The palate is concentrated and juicy, with sweet mango, ripe pear, and a rounded texture.  "
297,Ruinart Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,France,109,12.5,4.6,131,"A gorgeous rosé in a rich, vinous style, this shows a satiny mousse and well-honed acidity, which buoy a detailed range of macerated raspberry fruit, dried apricot, grated ginger, graphite and chopped roasted almond flavors. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay This blends chardonnay (45 percent) and pinot noir (55 percent, of which 19 percent was vinified as red wine). They come together in a lasting essence of roses and wild strawberries, the wine’s fruit complexity amplified by the sensation of acidity, with its fine limestone abrasion. A clean, simple beauty from Champagne. A blend of 55% Pinot Noir and 45% Chardonnay, and featuring around 25% reserve wines, this is 100% premier cru fruit from the Montagne des Reims and Côte des Blancs. Almost a third of the Pinot Noir was vinified as a still wine. A deep coral colour, this is fresh and youthful, with rounded wild red berry fruit, and hint of rose. With some time in the glass, it develops deeper, complex, more exotic notes, leading to a long and lively finish. Dosage: 8g/L. Rather dark-colored with cherry, watermelon and stone undertones. Full-bodied and layered, with iron and strawberry at the end. Drink now. "
298,Sonoma-Cutrer Sonoma Coast Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,California,26,13.9,4.6,9,Green-apple skin aromas and golden apple flavors are shaded with hints of caramel and pineapple in this flavorful and full-bodied wine. 
299,Angeline California Pinot Noir,2021,Pinot Noir,California,15,13.8,4.0,9,"Lots of Central Coast character with a medium body. Dried strawberries, hints of cherries and a citrus undertone. Some wet earth, too. Medium body. Very fresh. "
300,San Giorgio Ugolforte Brunello di Montalcino,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,54,14,4.4,5,"This is a full-bodied red with ripe blackberry, smoked-meat and burnt-orange notes. Strong tannins with a lots of chewiness. Quite tight on the finish. But there is pureness and beauty to this. More opulent than the 2015. Drink after 2025. Deep, dark red fruits and exotic spices give way to hints of menthol, flowery undergrowth and tobacco as the 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Ugolforte unfolds in the glass. It’s silky-smooth and cool-toned with ripe woodland berries, hints of clove and blood orange. Fine tannins coat the palate, but energy remains high due to vibrant acidity, as this tapers off with a salty, almost silty minerality under rosy inner florals. The 2016 spent only six months in second-pass barriques before being completed in 30-hectoliter Slavonian oak for another 40 months. Retasting this wine with another year of bottle age was a total pleasure. The 2016 Ugolforte Brunello has aromas of black raspberry, violets, and dusty earth. The palate is inviting with ripe cherry fruit, licorice, dried herbs, and fine-grained tannin's. This will certainly be a fun property to watch and there is an elegance to the 2016 that I feel is a wonderful introduction to the new ownership. Drink 2022-2035. The San Giorgio 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Ugolforte shows immediate richness and softness, with a smooth vinous texture that is fleshed out with ripe cherry, plum and dried blackberry. This expression offers extra dimension with a broad textural approach and attractive softness that is both velvety and elegant. There are earthy notes and hints of sour cherry on the close. Best after 2023. Blue-flower, star anise, coffee-bean and crushed mint aromas take shape in the glass. On the austere, linear palate, taut, close-grained tannins accompany sour cherry, blood orange and licorice while firm acidity keeps it light on its feet. "
301,Mumm Napa Brut,Prestige,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,California,24,12.5,4.0,721,"Delicate in style yet plush, with pretty cherry, lemon verbena and yeast roll flavors that linger on the supple, refreshing finish. Drink now A snappy sparkling that begins with a seriously fresh nose of green apple, orange blossom, citrus and gingerbread. These continue on the palate, driven by vibrant acidity and the unmistakable tang of freshly baked bread. Medium-bodied, balanced, crisp and complex, with a lengthy finish. "

303,Stonestreet Estate Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,California,45,14.3,4.1,7,"Rich nose of vanilla crème brûlée then focused but generous flavours of yellow apple, plum and banana giving sunshine and warmth. A light touch of reductive winemaking gives a struck match and gunsmoke character to the finish, elegantly balancing the rich fruit. This wine gets its cool tones from the high altitudes at the Jackson family’s Alexander Mountain Estate, a 5,500-acre property on the western slopes of the Mayacamas Mountains. Lisa Valtenbergs builds the blend from a range of parcels, at elevations from 400 to 1,800 feet. While the texture is soft and mellow, the wine sustains a crisp green freshness and bright undertones of lemon. Satisfying to drink on its own, this will readily take on soft-shell crabs or other rich shellfish. "
304,Nickel & Nickel Bear Track Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,125,14.9,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 Nickel & Nickel Bear Track Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon is the most elegant from the Nickel & Nickel stable. TASTING NOTES: This wine shows excellent sleekness on the palate. Enjoy its stylish aromas and flavors of dried earth and ripe berries with a spit-roasted, garlic, and rosemary-accented leg of lamb. (Tasted: September 3, 2020, San Francisco, CA) This offers up a solidly ripe core of crushed plum and warmed cassis notes laced with toasted vanilla, tobacco and a flash of loam. Light savory thread through the finish injects cut and energy. Best from 2021 through 2031. "
305,Il Molino di Grace Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Il Margone,2015,Sangiovese,Italy,50,14.5,3.7,17,"A core of sweet, ripe fruit grabs your attention, featuring cherry, plum, leather, earth and spice notes. Powerful, with burly tannins. The long aftertaste echoes the fruit, earth and spice elements. Best from 2021 through 2035. "
306,Doubleback Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Washington,159,0,0.0,0,"Aromas of cassis, bark and rosemary. Medium-to full-bodied with silky tannins.

307,Chateau de Saint Cosme Cote Rotie,2019,Syrah/Shiraz,France,100,14.6,4.6,7,"Big florals and raspberries mark the nose of Saint Cosme's 2019 Cote Rotie. Hints of stems show through, and this wine clearly would benefit from a few years in the cellar, but it is far from being unapproachable. Normally a blend of several lieux-dits, it sees about 30% new oak in its élevage, but the wood is scarcely noticeable. Medium to full-bodied, creamy and supple on the palate, with a long, fruit-infused finish, this should age gracefully for a decade or more. A racy, high-pitched, mineral-driven style, with raspberry and damson plum coulis notes pierced with savory and sanguine accents. The long, tight-grained, iron-edged finish resonates. If you’re looking for the dark side of Côte-Rôtie, this isn’t it. Instead, it’s lean and lithe, capturing the Rhône’s most northerly appellation in all its stony cool. Louis Barruol makes it from sérine, an old selection of syrah that he finds to be especially aromatic, which he gathers from a range of parcels and then allows to spontaneously ferment as whole bunches. Its floral notes come through clearly, lending lift and complexity to the woodsy berry fruit; herbal notes work with the tart cherry fruit to accent the wine’s cool savor. Vivacious and fresh, it’s a mouthwatering wine that should age well in the cellar for many years to come. The 2019 Côte Rôtie, which is all whole cluster Syrah, offers a more full-bodied, rich, powerful style while still holding on to plenty of elegance. Blackberries, crushed stone, ground pepper, and violets define the bouquet, and I love its balance, it brings lots of fruit yet stays pure and fresh, and it has a great finish. This is a ripe, powerful vintage for Côte Rôtie, and this handles it nicely. "
308,Valdicava Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,139,14.5,0.0,0,"Intense aromas of flowers and dark cherries. Perfumed and bright for the vintage. Full-bodied and firm with chewy yet polished tannins and a succulent and fruity finish that is in line and framed. The Valdicava 2017 Brunello di Montalcino shows a soft level of vintage ripeness that translates into dried strawberry or cooked cherry. These nuances are delicate and fine, however, and they are mitigated by the wine's acidity and the general clarity of the bouquet. Compared to past vintages, this 2017 is more accessible, but Valdicava has never been short on elegance or pedigree. Even that accessibility I mention is relative, because these wines have an excellent track record for longevity despite vintage variation. "
309,Yealands Estate Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,Zealand,24,13,3.9,52,"Lovely savoury ripe fruit lift, sea air and tomato leaf notes on the nose. Ripe and inviting on the palate. COMMENTARY: The 2021 Yealands Estate Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc is youthful, fresh, and well-built. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers pleasing aromas and flavors of grapefruit peel and savory spices. Enjoy it with a dozen raw oysters. (Tasted; October 3, 2021, San Francisco, CA) The heady aromas we've come to expect from NZ Sauvignon Blanc are out in full force here: freshly sliced green bell pepper, passionfruit, guava, lime and grapefruit pith, with a little of that feline pungency.

Packed with steeped blackberry, plum and fig notes, this red pumps a lot of fruit along, but there's ample support, with roasted apple wood, licorice root and sweet bay leaf accents coursing underneath.

Pungent red berry and cherry aromas are complemented by emerging floral and succulent herb nuances.

316,Penfolds Bin 149 Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,Other,149,14.7,4.1,6,"The combination of Cabernet Sauvignon from vineyards in Napa Valley and South Australia is an extension of Penfolds’ house style and has been christened with the unique term “Wine of the World.” Maturation for 16 months in new French (80%) and new American (20%) oak further adds to its globe-spanning distinction. A phantom of a wine, with a feminine sort of reined-in power and tension, it delivers both sweetness and a sassy, savory, keen sensation of sage on cocoa along with woodsy tones. The palpable dark fruit acts like drapes parting on the dynamic stage, revealing statuesque glamour A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, combining 85.1% fruit from the Napa Valley (predominantly from Oakville, Rutherford and Calistoga AVAs) and the remainder from several of Penfolds’ South Australian vineyards, moving it beyond the expected Napa Cab expression to instead exert its own unique personality. The Australian component introduces rich, lifted aromas of blueberry and blackberry, and a more opulent fruit presence. It adds freshness and vibrancy to the dense Napa body, resulting in a vivacious, cheery red still bound by firm tannins. A good portion, 85.1%, of this ""Wine of the World"" comes from America. In fact, the American component all comes from Napa. ""There are some great vineyards going in here,"" Peter Gago informed me. ""We are buying some fruit for this, but most of it comes off our own vineyards."" By ""own vineyards,"" Gago refers to the considerable land holdings of Treasury Wine Estates, which now owns such iconic Napa names such as Beringer, Sterling Vineyards and Stags’ Leap Winery. The major component of this component, 28%, comes from Rutherford, with the other components ""cherry picked"" from across the Napa region. So, that is the American wine part of this wine. "
317,Gran Moraine Yamhill-Carlton Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Oregon,48,13,4.7,9,"A vibrant red that's multilayered with raspberry and tart cherry flavors that are accented by crushed stone and dusky spice notes, building tension toward medium-grained tannins. Best from 2030. Aromas of dark strawberry and stone with some orange-peel undertones. Medium to full body with a solid texture of pure tannins and a fresh finish. Curated and focused. Sustainable.  "
318,Billecart-Salmon Brut Rose (375ML,half-bottle),Sparkling Rosé,France,49,12,4.5,118,"COMMENTARY: After decades of tasting and savoring the Billecart-Salmon Brut Rosé Champagne, this wine remains one of my favorites wines in the world. TASTING NOTES: This wine is fresh, bright, and steady with its alluring aromas and flavors of red currants and strawberries. Enjoy it with fresh salmon and avocado hand rolls. (Tasted: April 22, 2021, San Francisco, CA) The NV Champagne Brut Rose is an attractive pale salmon hue, with a fresh perfume of wild strawberry, ripe peach, white and red flowers, a hint of tropical fruit, and grapefruit. The palate is rounded, with fruit up front and through the mid-palate, and it has a silky and fresh lift. There is a wonderful ease and drinkability to this wine, which delivers balance and finesse. Best after 2022. Attractive salmon color with aromas of dried strawberries and lemons, as well as hints of flowers. Full-bodied with tight tension from the fine phenolics that run through the palate. Hints of white pepper, peaches and sliced green strawberries with some candied lemons, too. Always an excellent bottle. 40% chardonnay, 30% pinot noir and 30% pinot meunier. Drink now. A dry style of brut, emphasizing great fruitiness, and with a touch of bottle age, this Champagne is ready to drink. Citrus, red fruits and tight minerality from the 40% Chardonnay in the blend, offer a wine under tension and worth aging another year in bottle. Drink now or from 2023. Delicate notes of yellow plum, marzipan, verbena and fleur de sel are set in this firm and finely meshed rosé Champagne. Creamy finish. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Drink now. "
319,Beaulieu Vineyard Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,34,14.7,4.0,55,"Plenty of blackcurrant with dark chocolate and coffee character. It’s full-bodied, yet the tannins are succulent and rather weightless, giving a velvety texture at the end. So delicious now. Hard to wait. In fact, not necessary. Drink or hold. A polished and inviting style, with warm cassis and gently mulled plum fruit flavors gliding through atop pretty mocha, singed vanilla and loam accents, while a gentle savory echo adds range through the finish. Approachable now, but there's no rush. Drink now. Approachable in style and affordable in price, this wine impresses in its offerings of dried cherry, plum and tobacco, the oak toasted and well-integrated into the mix. Expansive and full-bodied on the palate, it has length and breadth and is enjoyable young. "
320,Massolino Vigna Margheria Barolo,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,114,14.5,0.0,0,"Wild berry, cedar, scorched earth and camphor form the nose along with spicy accents. Tightly wound and firmly structured, the savory palate also shows finesse, offering dried cherry, blood orange, licorice and tobacco framed in firm, refined tannins. This wine’s red- cherry flavors are crisp and precise, fully ripe without any of the dried-fruit flavors or alcoholic warmth that afflicts some wines from this hot and dry vintage. The tannins feel fully ripe as well, seamlessly weaving together the red fruit, subtle earth and spice notes as the wine moves toward a graceful, balanced finish. Taut and linear, this Barolo walks the line between red berry fruits and savory, herbal elements. Underlining it all is a backbone of iron and dense, fine-grained tannins. Put it all together and you have a nascent red with terrific potential. More subdued aromatically speaking, the Massolino 2017 Barolo Margheria is timid on first nose and takes longer to open. I coaxed the wine in my glass for a while before getting a fuller picture of red and purple fruits, grilled herb, limestone and a spicy hint of white peppercorn. I remember the cooler 2016 vintage as beautifully exuberant and expressive overall, whereas this 2017 edition has a quieter personality. "
321,Duboeuf Moulin-a-Vent Domaine des Rosiers,2020,Gamay,France,35,13.5,3.8,6,"A firm and silky red with cherry, berry and some cedar character. Medium body. Slightly chewy on the finish. But solid. Give it a year or two to soften. Try after 2022. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Domaine de Rosiers Moulin-a-Vent delivers power with finesse. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers attractive berry aromas and flavors that stay firm and lasting. Serve it with a well-seasoned prime rib. (Tasted: October 26, 2022, Napa, CA) From old vines, this wine from a family estate is solid and structured thanks to ripe tannins. Blackberry fruits come through, bringing a fresher aspect. The wine will age further, so drink from 2023. "
322,Catena Zapata Adrianna Vineyard White Stones Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,Argentina,129,12.9,4.6,5,"The amazing 2019 White Stones Chardonnay comes from a select group of 27 rows planted on lot I of the Adriana Vineyard, and the composition of those rows is soil with white oval stones covered by gravel. The Adriana Vineyard is planted at an altitude of almost 1,500 meters above sea level, in the district of Gualtallary in Tupungato. The stony soil prevents deep root growth, providing optimum drainage. This soil, which is very poor in organic matter, contributes to the vines' permanent stress conditions. The cool nights allow for very slow ripening, optimal acid retention and low yields.

This is always a more austere wine than the White Bones, more mineral and restrained, less aromatic, with great balance, a little higher in alcohol and with very good acidity, rounder and more Meursault than Chablis but still with citrus freshness and pungent flavors and always some spice (curry) because of the aging in barrel with flor. This year, the two whites show a more marked personality, possibly aided by the style of the cooler year but also because the winery has a better understanding of the places. It's still very young and undeveloped; it's drinkable now, but with more time in bottle, it should develop greater complexity. Now the finish shows acidity and salt, which make it very vibrant. 6,600 bottles were filled in May 2020. A very fresh, bright white with sliced apple, pear and light cream. Full-bodied with a very pretty texture. Mineral, chalk and lightly salty mineral undertones. Intense finish. Really takes off. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Catena Zapata White Bones Chardonnay is an outstanding wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits aromas and flavors of savory spices, leaves, mineral notes, and a hint of flowers. Try it with broiled lobster in a decadent cream sauce. (Tasted: March 23, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The 2019 Chardonnay White Stones Adrianna Vineyard is from the eponymous vineyard in Tupungato, Uco Valley, and was aged for up to 16 months in used French barrels. Bright yellow in the glass. The nose offers hazelnuts, herbs and a whiff of oak alongside hints of linden blossom and acacia. Intense and concentrated in the mouth, this has a skeletal structure and a compact, saline, tangy palate before powerful aromas of fruit and oak gather at the back of the throat to deliver an elongated finish helped along by the acidity. "
323,Famille Perrin Chateauneuf-du-Pape Les Sinards,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,50,0,3.9,12,"Rich berry nose, smooth texture, and spicy notes of plum
and black raspberry; elegant, balanced, and long. There's a lot to like about this version, which leads off with warmed fruitcake and red licorice notes, followed quickly by bramble-lined raspberry, blackberry and cherry compote flavors. Features a roasted apple wood frame that guides it all through the juicy finish. Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre and Cinsault. Drink now. "
324,Antinori Villa Antinori Chianti Classico Riserva,2018,Sangiovese,Italy,35,14,4.2,47,"This is tight on the palate with cherries and berries and hints of toasted oak and cedar. It’s medium-bodied and compact, with fine tannins and a fresh finish. Lovely fruit at the end. Drink or hold. The 2018 Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori shows the mid-weight style of the year nicely. Silky and aromatic, the 2018 is super-expressive right out of the gate. Dark red cherry, spice, menthol and leather build into the gracious, persistent finish. This is very nicely done. An intense red, with an accent of vanilla shading the cherry, raspberry, woodsy and tobacco flavors. On the long finish, a resinous note emerges as this winds down. Although balanced, this still needs time to integrate the oaky elements. Drink now through 2033. This medium-bodied red opens with aromas of menthol, ripe plum, violet and tobacco. The elegantly structured palate offers tart red cherry, star anise and coffee bean accompanied by polished, fine-grained tannins. This wine sources its fruit from across the Chianti Classico appellation, as Marchesi Antinori has access to parcels throughout the various comuni represented. The 2018 Chianti Classico Riserva Villa Antinori opens to a sweet note of summer cherry and wild plum that is so characteristic of Sangiovese. The wine is shapely and soft with some distant oak spice, blue flower and potting soil. A small part of Merlot is blended in to add that extra plushness that I have described. "
325,Borgo Scopeto Chianti Classico,2018,Sangiovese,Italy,21,13,3.9,265,"Tangy and lush with notes of violet and plum; rich and balanced, stylish and long. "
326,Clos Apalta,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,Chile,119,15,4.2,45,"This is really focused and refined with fantastic dried flowers and dark berries. Dried-lavender and mint undertones. Medium-to full-bodied with refined and polished tannins that are all together and so focused. Really integrated and melted together on the palate. Compact and very linear. Please give this two or three years to come completely together, but it’s already breathtaking. Better to drink after 2022. The 2016 Clos Apalta is a blend of 64% Carménère (higher than in 2015), 19% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Merlot hitting the scale at 15% alcohol with a pH of 3.7. The Carménère and Cabernet were planted ungrafted in 1920, and all the vineyards are organic and biodynamic (certified) and very low yielding. The hand-destemmed grapes fermented in oak vats and barriques (17%), and the wine went through malolactic and 26 months of aging in brand new French barriques. I've seen a great improvement in Carménère in Chile in the last few years, perhaps since they stopped wanting to grow it everywhere and focused on the places where it grows well, like the Apalta region. They have also learned to tame the green aromas and fierce tannins and alcohol and to produce much more harmonious reds, like this aromatic example that reveals spice, tobacco leaves, red fruit and floral notes without noticeable alcohol or excess ripeness. Refined, with savory richness to the mineral-infused raspberry, red currant and herbal shadings. Creamy hints emerge midpalate, leading to a crisp, well-structured finish that lingers with slate and cast iron notes. Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Drink now through 2025. "
327,Etude Carneros Estate Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,48,14.1,4.2,36,"Vivid strawberry and dried-flower aromas here with hints of sandalwood. Medium to full body with firm, creamy tannins and a tangy finish. Opulent. Tight and focused. Pumice and black and white-pepper notes. A pretty wine already, but give it a year or two to open and soften. A well-made, larger production offering, this wine is richly layered in strawberry, raspberry and black tea, the oak slightly sweet and toasty. Smoky overtones provide a hint of game and earth, leading to a cohesive, resolved finish.  "
328,Stags' Leap Winery The Investor Red Wine,2018,Other Red Blends,California,61,14.3,4.4,47,"This is blowzy and rich, yet there are plenty of tannins to back it up, and they are dusty and firm at that. Full-bodied, but not heavy in any way. Layered and already delicious. A blend of merlot, petite sirah, cabernet sauvignon and malbec. Drink or hold. "
329,Chateau Pape Clement,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,129,14,4.5,52,"Stunning concentration of perfectly ripe blackcurrants here with a delicate whiff of vanilla oak and extremely fine tannins that are almost perfectly integrated on the seductive and delicate palate, right through the almost literally breathtaking, super-long and very polished finish. Try from 2022. Tasted on two separate occasions, the 2016 Château Pape Clément never failed to disappoint, offering a huge, powerful, full-bodied personality as well as beautiful notes of cassis, graphite, high-class cigar tobacco, asphalt, and graphite. About as sexy as it gets in the vintage, with silky tannins and loads of fruit, it’s perfectly balanced and has a great finish. The 2016 is a blend of 60% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, and the balance Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, all raised in 60% new barrels. This takes a slightly different tack than many of its Pessac colleagues, relying less on bramble and tar and more on alluring toast, with mocha, anise, wood spice and black tea notes draped liberally over the core of sappy kirsch and cherry preserve flavors. Plush and suave through the finish, though this needs a bit of time for the wood elements to be fully integrated with the fruit. For fans of the flashier, cashmere-textured style. Best from 2023 through 2037. Blended of 60% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc, the 2016 Pape Clement has a deep garnet-purple color and quite a serious, earthy nose with truffles, tilled soil, underbrush and smoked meats over a cassis, baked plums and redcurrants core plus a touch of lavender. Medium to full-bodied, firm and grainy, the palate is built like a brick house, supporting muscular black fruit and earthy notions and finishing very long and mineral laced. This rich, warm wine offers tannins cushioned within layers of black fruits. It is dense with structure and fruit while also having the freshness and acidity typical of this vintage. The wine will age for several years, becoming richer and more opulent. Drink from 2025. An extremely attractive Pape Clement, with its own style and the feeling of the fruit being layered over a silky, seductive line of dark chocolate and tarry oak – and it works. This is big but has good balance, not over the top. It's enjoyable, silky and richly textured, and will age well. The tannins start to build on the finish, with a chewy quality that speaks of the extraction. There’s a lot to enjoy here. Invariably a wine that makes no apologies for ripeness and one that exhibits an extra degree of concentration and fruity richness right from the opening bell, Pape Clément is in fine and familiar form in 2016 and is a broad, liberally filled effort of compelling depth. It is moderately full-bodied, slightly supple feel and carries its ample tannins with a good deal of grace, and, it is, all in all, a complete and eminently collectable wine that ranks with the better bottlings of its appellation.

330,Oyster Bay Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc,2022,Sauvignon Blanc,Zealand,13,12.5,4.1,38,"COMMENTARY: The 2022 Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc is engaging and smooth on the palate.

It's medium to full-bodied, framed by soft, silky, dusty tannins and finished off by hints of vanilla. It's a step up from the winery's basic Cabernet and Merlot, more accessible and nicely balanced, even if it lacks varietal signature. Best After 2022 "
335,The Walls The Ramparts,2019,Rhone Red Blends,Washington,65,14.5,0.0,0,"Mostly Grenache (60%), the 2019 The Ramparts is a Southern Rhône-inspired blend that shows off really good aromatic range, from white-pepper-dusted bacon to orange rind, pipe tobacco and bright red fruits that all collide in the glass.

Not the biggest wine, but all about finesse and deliciousness. This is a change for the Napa Valley bottling, from mostly Paul Hobbs vineyards in Coombsville. Drink after 2022. Ripe and well-defined, with a mix of açaí berry, blueberry and blackberry notes driving along, laced with dark earth and sweet tobacco. Solidly grippy, with a bolt of iron through the finish. A textbook introduction to Coombsville. Best from 2022 through 2032. "
338,Wente Morning Fog Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,California,18,13.5,3.8,53,"Following a good streak of acidity and notes of toasted coconut, banana, lychee, and honeysuckle, flavors of green apple and toasted cinnamon alight on the finish. There's a steely edge to the pear, apple and crisp pineapple aromas on the nose of this bottling. The palate sizzles with acidity and offers a touch of grip, with Key line pie flavors most prevalent.

340,Opus One (1.5 Liter Magnum),2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,979,14,0.0,0,"A fist of late summer cherries, raspberry and bilberry fruits set out their stall, all with the juicy character that confirms, even in a hot vintage like 2017, Opus can deliver balance and sculpted elegance. Beautiful grip, creamy texture with a strikingly powerful tannic frame. As the wine stays in the glass the floral aromatics begin to bloom up. A brilliant Opus. 20 days maceration - around half what it would have been a decade ago. 54% native yeast, as part of their native yeast project. 5% Merlot and 1% Malbec complete the blend. Harvest spread out over September 5 to October 8, just before the fires, by which time they had less than 10% of the fruit still out on the vines. 3.7pH. Opus One had picked 91% of their fruit before the fires started in 2017, and only two lots were eliminated from consideration. The 2017 Opus One, bottled in July 2019, is a blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8.5% Petit Verdot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 4.5% Merlot and 1% Malbec.

342,Domaine de la Janasse Chateauneuf-du-Pape Cuvee Chaupin,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,95,15.5,0.0,0,"I was blown away by the 2020 Châteauneuf Du Pape Chaupin, a 100% Grenache release that comes almost exclusively from the Chaupin lieu-dit in the northern part of the appellation. It's never as inky-hued or powerful as the Vieilles Vignes but always screams Grenache with its sexy, ripe, seamless, and remarkably elegant style. The 2020 offers a translucent ruby/purple hue as well as incredible aromatics of blackberries, black raspberries, peppery garrigue, herbes de Provence, and flowers, and it opens up nicely with time in the glass. Full-bodied and concentrated on the palate, it has silky tannins, no hard edges, and a great finish. I finished my note with ""a Grenache lover's dream."" This is up with the finest vintages produced and will evolve for 15+ years. Best after 2022 Full-bodied, generous in fruit and glycerol. The tannins and acidity seem to meld together into a single vertebral column. The alcohol is present, lending sweetness rather than heat. Remarkably elegant for a wine of these dimensions, with great, rising, upright flavours and structure. This is a very special wine with a long finish. Parcels of Grenache planted on lieux-dits Chapouin, La Janasse and La Crau, the oldest planted in 1912. Ripe but very focused, with a streamlined feel to the mix of raspberry, red currant and bitter cherry fruit flavors.

345,Chateau Palmer,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,399,0,4.8,13,"The finest vintage I’ve ever tasted from this estate, surpassing the 2009 and 2010, the 2016 Château Palmer is a blend of 47% each of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Petit Verdot, all of which was brought up in 65% new French oak. This magical effort reveals a saturated purple color as well as a huge nose of crème de cassis, graphite, crushed rocks, and spring flowers, and it develops beautifully with time in the glass. Full-bodied, deep, incredibly concentrated and powerful, it nevertheless just glides over the palate with flawless purity and balance, present, ripe tannins, and a finish that just won’t quit. This is Bordeaux at its most regal and classic. It will be drinkable with just 4-5 years of bottle age and keep for half a century. Such attractive fruit and alluring ripeness that it draws you in from the get-go. The discreet power here is delivered with a very astute touch. Assorted dark-berry aromas, as well as red plums, abound on the nose. The richness and depth in the mouth is stunning. The tannins are super polished and layered and they draw pristine dark fruit flavors deep into the finish in effortless mode. This is a star of the vintage. A blend of 47 per cent merlot, 47 per cent cabernet sauvignon and six per cent petit verdot. Try from 2024. As is always the case with Palmer, the richness, depth and silkiness is just so impressive. Sophisticated and well constructed, with a vertical lift-off, there's a creamy richness on the palate which supports pencil-lead, liquorice, damson, black cherry and slate. I love the smoky cocoa bean finish. Like the Alter Ego, it's a different style this year but no less impressive, displaying width, heft and incredible persistency. It's a wine that's going to age far into the future and is extremely easy to recommend. The highest ever proportion of grand vin was produced in 2016. This is a very solid rendering, with a core of steeped blackberry, black currant and fig fruit flavors that are juicy and well-defined. The back end picks up lots of graphite, tobacco, anise and violet notes while maintaining focus and energy. Shows latent depth as the fruit echoes steadily. Best from 2023 through 2038. "
346,Alamos Malbec,2021,Malbec,Argentina,11,13.5,4.0,21,"Notes of blackberries, dark cherries, blackcurrants and baking spices. Medium body with creamy tannins. Round and juicy with lots of fruit and a ripe, chocolatey finish. "
347,Arrowood Reserve Speciale Cabernet Sauvignon,2014,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,100,14.4,4.6,8,"Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve Speciale has a black forest cake and crème de cassis-scented nose with touches of charcoal, black soil, mocha and salami plus a hint of cigar box. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is packed with black fruit and savory layers with beautifully ripe, fine-grained tannins and just enough freshness, finishing with great persistence. "
348,Veuve Clicquot Vintage Brut Rose,2012,Sparkling Rosé,France,105,12,4.6,28,"A rosé Champagne for red-wine drinkers, thanks to all the red-berry and earthy character, plus some rather serious tannins. The long finish is carried by a positive hint of bitterness. Pinot noir dominates the blend, of which 14% was red wine made specifically for this product. Drink or hold. This is a powerful Rosé, built with the addition of 13 percent red wine (pinot noir from Bouzy) and 11 percent of the blend aged in oak foudres. It starts off youthfully intense, with a smoky black-tea edge to the tannins. The wine is structured and savory, freighted with limestone earthiness until it grows bright and racy with air. This is built to last. "
349,J. Lohr Estates Riverstone Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,13,14,3.9,92,"Stones deposited by the Arroyo Seco River influence the vines’ growth in this cool growing area, limiting soil depth. The Mt. Eden Clone, known for tight clusters and concentrated fruit, makes its debut in this vintage, which was barrel-fermented and hand-stirred weekly for seven to nine months in American, Hungarian, and French oak—resulting in stunning clarity on the palate. Accented by perky acidity, earthiness strikes a chord with notes of fresh peach and tangerine. Vanilla nougat leaves a splash of texture on the toasty finish. "
350,Vietti Barolo Castiglione,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,75,0,4.6,7,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 Vietti Barolo Castiglione is racy and memorable on the palate.

(Tasted: November 19, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Plenty of wild-berry character to the nose and palate. Medium-bodied with good fruit focus and firm tannin that will need a year or two to soften. Bright and youthful.  "
351,Obsidian Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,36,14.8,4.1,52,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Obsidian Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon brings excellent attention to the somewhat under-the-radar Red Hills. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of black fruit, dried spices, and oak. Enjoy it with grilled beef. (Tasted: September 29, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Significantly tannic but also flavorful enough to pull it off, this full-bodied wine is a good candidate for further aging. It brims with black currant, graphite and black cherry flavors that are vivid but not overblown, achieving good balance and complexity. Aged for 18 months in 40% new Hungarian oak barrels, it should be best from 2026. Black fruit, graphite, walnut husk, charred bark and crushed peppercorns on the nose. It’s medium-to full-bodied with firm, tight-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Excellent structure and freshness. Drink from 2023. "

353,Casa Emma Vignalparco Chianti Classico Riserva,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,35,14,4.0,27,"An extrovert but elegant Tuscan red, this shows baking spices, dark cherries and plums, cedar, dried peppers and meaty undertones. Full-bodied and nicely structured on the palate, it expertly weaves a fine line between richness, spiciness and freshness. Drink from 2021 The fruit comes from a two-hectare site called Vignalparco that is unique because ducks run free between the vines, doing an excellent job of fertilizing and hopefully eating any pests. (Yes, ducks can eat grapes, but rarely off of the vines.) The resulting 2016 Chianti Classico Riserva Vignalparco (with 11,000 bottles made) is a compact and solid wine with a very pretty bouquet composed of black fruit elements, spice and wild rose. There is smoke, tar and road paving at the end. There is a bright point of acidity on the close, making it a terrific candidate for (dare I suggest it?) a classic Tuscan pappardelle all'anatra, or pappardelle with fatty duck. Sorry. A solid backbone of tannins provides the backdrop for this lightly chewy red. Cherry, iron, tobacco and earth flavors are knotted together with the firm structure. A dusty feel lingers. Best from 2022 through 2036. Earthy and structured, this has aromas suggesting forest floor, new leather and ripe berry. The juicy, solidly built palate offers black cherry extract, licorice and coffee bean framed against assertive, rather grainy tannins. It closes on a note of rusty nail. Drink 2021–2031. "
354,Tapiz Black Tears Malbec,2018,Malbec,Argentina,54,14.5,0.0,0,"Deep blue and black fruit here, with floral, spicy and balsamic accents. Brooding and complex. You have to fathom the power of tannin on the palate, as the texture is so ultra-fine and polished. But don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of tannins here, only so seamless that they make it taste so effortless. Naturally concentrated, juicy and long. Delivers aromas of petrichor and dried violet that make for an alluring entry, while the palate offers nice vibrancy to well-defined plum and red currant flavors. Offers nuances of mineral and olive that fold in around fine tannins and a lingering note of dark chocolate. "

357,Torbreck RunRig,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,185,15,0.0,0,"Torbreck's 2018 RunRig needs a bit of air right now, as the nose and palate truly open up and expand after a while in the glass. Unlike some vintages, it's rather tight and cedary upon first pour, then relaxes to reveal hints of stone fruit, blueberries, cherries, pastry crust and baking spices. In the mouth, it's full-bodied and concentrated, richly textured and marked by ripe tannins, which leave behind a velvety, mouth-coating finish tinged with licorice and dark berries. While approachable now—and even damn enjoyable—it deserves another several years in the cellar. Drink the 2018 Descendant while waiting. The must-try wine Tightly wound yet with cashmere tannins, soft kid-glove oak and cut-finger minerality. The anise, clove and cinnamon-edged palate is unbelievably svelte, like melted chocolate. On day two, succulent, spicy cherry fruit emerges, with blackberry liqueur, roses and violets. Savoury cep undertones, graphite and cedar follow through on an endless finish. A stunning blend of six old vineyards, one planted in the 1850s. A really complex wine already, this has aromas of blackberry, tar and dried spice, as well as blueberry and gentle, herbal edges. The essence-like blackberries and dark plums are delivered in a rich, full-flavored style. Great old-vine shiraz from a stunning vintage. There's a floral note of dried lavender to the dried apricot and fresh black cherry flavors at the core, with accents of Earl Grey tea, sweet spices and cigar box. A touch of cedar and minerality lingers in the background, with polished tannins. Shiraz and Viognier. Drink now through 2036. "
358,Wolffer Summer in a Bottle Cotes de Provence Rose,2021,Rosé,France,27,12.4,4.1,69,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Wölffer Estate Vineyard Côtes de Provence Summer in a Bottle delivers fine and lasting textures. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of dried earth, racy red fruits, and dried earth. Enjoy it with lemongrass chicken over jasmine rice.

361,Pahlmeyer Merlot,2019,Merlot,California,109,15.1,0.0,0,"Ripe plums and blueberries with slate, sweet tobacco and bark, Full-bodied, yet very fresh, with firm, layered tannins and a rich finish. Spices at the end. Juicy. Better in two or three years. Try after 2025. Pahlmeyer's 2019 Merlot comes mainly from the estate vineyard, with smaller proportions from the Rancho Chimiles, Broken Rock and Stagecoach Vineyards. It's all Merlot this year, with aging in barrels from Taransaud (75% new). Beautiful notes of loamy earth and mocha accent black cherries and plums on the nose, while the full-bodied palate is somewhere between velvet and silk in texture, and the lingering finish adds savory hints of cocoa and black olive. Flamboyant yet impeccably structured, with rich and detailed black cherry and red currant flavors accented by mocha espresso and toasty oak. Finishes with rich, supple tannins.  "
362,Paul Hobbs Russian River Pinot Noir,2020,Pinot Noir,California,79,14.3,0.0,0,"An attractive nose of ripe red fruit and berries, fresh mint and black licorice. Medium-to full-bodied with fine-grained tannins and a smooth texture. Bright, citrus-like acidity that adds a lot of life to the flavors of fresh colored flowers and ripe red cherries. Good intensity and balance. Drink or hold. Medium ruby-purple, the 2020 Pinot Noir is scented of cranberries, underbrush, tobacco leaves and woodsmoke. The palate is light-bodied, silky and bright with earth-laced fruits and a long, spicy finish. The quintessential 2020 Pinot Noir Russian River Valley is flush with cola spice, grenadine, and sappy forest floor, while the palate opens with generous ripe red fruits of cherry, beet root, and cinnamon. Bursts with juicy, well-detailed pomegranate, cherry and blackberry flavors that are carried by sleek, well-embedded acidity. This has light anise and violet hints skittering in the background, with a bright mineral edge that helps drive the finish. Very solid all around. Drink now "
363,Domaine Lafage Bastide Miraflors Vieilles Vignes,2018,Rhone Red Blends,France,16,0,3.9,58,"Based on 74% Syrah and 26% Grenache brought up in in a combination of concrete tanks (for the Grenache) and one year old demi-muids (for the Syrah), the 2018 Cotes Du Roussillon Bastide Miraflors is a knockout bottle of wine. It offers loads of black fruits, roasted herbs, peppered meat, violets, and bacon fat as well as full-bodied richness, a round, opulent style, ripe tannins, and a blockbuster finish. It’s one of the finest values out there. "
364,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars S.L.V. Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,199,14.5,4.7,6,"This is one of the best SLVs I have tasted with total balance and structure that highlights what was possible in 2018. It’s full-bodied, yet tight and poised, with layer upon layer of fine tannins that give depth and beauty to this young red. Blackcurrant, blueberry and floral flavors. Tight at the end. Needs until 2025 to really show what it has. Polished and open at first, showing a fan-friendly set of creamed plum and warmed cassis flavors, laced with melted licorice and sweet toast accents. Features alder and warm earth hints that check in on the finish, adding extra range and length while giving the fruit a grounded feel in the end. Very solidly built. "
365,Chateau Gloria,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,57,13.5,4.1,36,"Beautiful aromas of blackcurrants and blueberries. Hot-stone undertones. Full-bodied, very tight and focused with very fine tannins that are strong and bright. Compressed. Serious. Try in 2023. This has a slightly chunky feel now, with bramble and tar notes jutting out a bit, but the core is saturated with cassis and blackberry fruit flavors and there's fun energy throughout. Offers a lovely tug of sweet tobacco detail on the finish too. Just let this settle in the cellar. Best from 2024 through 2038. Immediately on the nose you get the rich structure of the fruit, rippling with texture and life. It has just the right amount of drama, offering a tight and well-focussed delivery. This is beautiful, showing great underlying freshness and grip with real tension and minerality. Drinking Window 2027 - 2050 I was lucky enough to taste the 2016 Château Gloria on multiple occasions and it’s unquestionably the finest vintage of this cuvée I’ve tasted. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, aged in 42% new French oak, its deep purple color is followed by a powerful, medium to full-bodied wine that has thrilling purity in its ripe black and blue fruits, tobacco, and graphite-laced aromas and flavors. Deep, layered, with ripe tannins and the purity and freshness that makes the vintage so special, this is a brilliant Gloria to drink over the coming 20+ years. The 2016 Gloria is showing brilliantly and appears to be entering the beginning of its drinking window. Offering up a deep bouquet of sweet crème de cassis and blackberries mingled with sweet spices and licorice. Medium to full-bodied, deep and layered, with fine concentration, ripe tannins and bright acids, it's a vibrant, precise wine from this sometimes rather flamboyantly styled estate, impressing for its purity of fruit and structural seamlessness. The tannins in this wine are firm, resulting in a selection of more structural grip than fruity opulence. It will need to evolve and mellow, ensuring that the fruit is allowed to come forward. "
366,Masciarelli Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,2019,Montepulciano,Italy,11,13,3.6,77,"Clean, mixed brambleberry character with light herb and mineral touches. Medium-bodied with bright fruit, well-integrated and lightly firm tannins and a balanced finish. Always super value for money. Drink now. "
367,Warre's Vintage Port,2017,Port,Portugal,140,20,0.0,0,"Loads of wet earth and grape aromas with hints of stems. Old vine aromas of bark and moss. Full-bodied, sweet and structured with a big kick on the end. Very impressive. Exceptional layers of fruit and energy. A stronger and more muscular Warre. Lush and inviting in feel, with a beautifully creamy texture that lets plum
sauce, blueberry reduction and raspberry pâte de fruit flavors glide along
effortlessly. Notes of violet, anise and black tea are beguiling in the
background before melding seamlessly on the finish. This shimmers with
fruit, balanced by depth and spine. Best from 2035 through 2055 This is an unusually powerful vintage of Warre’s— “A huge wine,” said Craig Ganzer, a rare-wine appraiser who joined our 2017 Porto panel. “As big and rich as it is, it’s not clunky or cloying.” The power and mass comes from different sides, including a heavy drape of oak and a complete range of fruit at what feels like optimal ripeness, with raspberry and darker blueberry notes creating a mouthwatering sensation. Notes of hibiscus and pressed flowers tie directly into the tannins through the wine’s beeswax density. This has the remarkable integration that is a hallmark of the vintage, and a vinous character that should be fascinating to revisit as the wine ages.  A ripe, floral wine that has many layers of black fruits with a fresh touch of acidity. The wine is dense while also elegant and poised with tannins and fruit already in balance. That suggests the Port will age relatively quickly. Drink from 2025. "
368,Chateau Laribotte Sauternes (375ML half-bottle),2018,Other Dessert,France,40,13,4.4,36,"Already balanced with orange-peel flavors alongside honey, this wine shows richness and some concentration from botrytis. An attractive light touch hints at freshness while keeping the ripe flavors. Drink from 2023. "
369,Alvaro Palacios Camins del Priorat,2020,Other Red Blends,Spain,28,0,4.0,98,"Sweet-berry, watermelon and orange aromas follow through to a full body with soft, fine tannins and a fruity finish. Friendly and delicious. Drink now. The regional blend 2020 Camins del Priorat, produced with grapes from 101 plots from eight villages in Priorat, is a blend of 55% Garnacha, 15% Syrah, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot and 8% Cariñena, higher in Garnacha and lower in Cariñena, like in the majority of 2019s. That gives the wines freshness and elegance, vivacity and fluidity. It fermented with the indigenous yeasts in a combination of stainless steel, oak and concrete vats and matured in barrel and oak vats for four months. This is more Priorat than any of the vintages of Camins; in reality, nobody is planting French varieties anymore and many are regrafting their vines, so in the future, the tendency could be toward more Garnacha and Cariñena in this wine. This is a very drinkable version of Camins, less dense than the 2019, from a year that was cooler with just an herbal hint. The mouthfeel is velvety with great freshness and very fine tannins. This has to be the finest Camins to date, different from previous years; it should be a commercial success. 226,000 bottles were produced. 2020 was their earliest harvest ever. "

371,Melville Estate Sta. Rita Hills Syrah,2019,Syrah/Shiraz,California,41,13.8,0.0,0,"Chad Melville’s estate-grown syrah leans on the Estrella River clone, a selection that’s late to bloom and late to ripen—it is typically harvested in November, the whole clusters submitted to a cold soak, native fermentation, and aging in neutral barrels. It’s low-intervention winemaking with a stunning result: The wildly exotic aromatics bring lavender, violets, plum, smoked tea, olive and, above all, pepper—like walking under a pepper tree on a warm afternoon as the fruit nears peak ripeness. The flavors are exotic, lush and herbal at once, delivered with a creamy midpalate and fine leafy tannins, elegant and long. It’s drinking beautifully now and would be a wonder to follow as it ages. The 2019 Syrah Estate has a medium ruby-purple color and is bursting with blackberry jam and blueberry aromas with broody tones of cast iron, chargrill, aniseed and dried herbs. The palate is lovely, with a balance of bright berry accents of savory, earthy tones. It has an abundance of finely grained tannins, notable freshness and lift, and a long, herbal finish. The 2019 Syrah Estate Sta. Rita Hills always seems to deliver. Revealing a ruby/plum color as well as peppery notes of red and black fruits, tapenade, and gamey meats, it's medium-bodied and has a supple, elegant texture, nicely integrated acidity, and a great finish. "
372,Bodegas Vega Sicilia Unico Tinto,2010,Tempranillo,Spain,569,14.5,5.0,8,"This is still very tight and closed with so much depth and beauty. The linear line to this is very vertical and draws you down. It shows intense blackberry, dark-chocolate, hazelnut and walnut character. Full body. Chewy yet extremely polished. Precise. Shows decadence. Unico is Tinto Fino, with 6% Cabernet Sauvignon, in contrast to Valbuena No.5, which has a small dash of Merlot. It opens with alluring aromas of dark plums, spice and oak. As expected, it's powerful, intense and very long, but within that you can note the very fine tannins, the result of the assiduous attention to ageing in different types and sizes of vats over the years. There's an element of tobacco smoke, of black fruits, of the dark plums promised in the aromas, the whole beautifully integrated. A vintage and a wine that's hard to better. This has 25 to 30 years ahead of it, but you could also enjoy it within a few years - that's the essence of Vega Sicilia, its interplay of youth and ageability. Opaque violet. Intensely perfumed, expansive black and blue fruit preserve, potpourri, Moroccan spice and botanical herb scents are complemented by smoky mineral and vanilla flourishes. Sappy, penetrating and deeply concentrated on the palate, offering vibrant, mineral-laced black currant, bitter cherry, chewing tobacco, mocha and floral pastille flavors that deepen and turn sweeter on the back half. Shows superb focus and vibrant, floral lift on the wonderfully long, youthfully tannic finish, which leaves behind cherry liqueur, candied violet and spicecake notes.  I was surprised by the aromatics of the 2010 Único, cropped from a powerful and concentrated year that delivered this blend of 94% Tinto Fino (aka Tempranillo) and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon, with 14.5% alcohol and a highish pH of 3.87. It fermented with indigenous yeasts and matured in a combination of French and American oak barrels and 20,000-liter oak vats and aged for almost six years. It feels quite ripe and somehow old style, dominated by ripe black fruit, with a rustic and earthy touch. It has an ample palate, concentrated and powerful, with some earthy tannins. This red is dense, balanced and complex. Plum, dried currant, cigar box, leather and mineral flavors mingle over ripe, well-integrated tannins. Orange peel acidity keeps this lively through the long, floral finish. Harmonious and graceful, in a classic style. Tinto Fino and Cabernet Sauvignon. As meaty and gamey as dry-aged filet mignon, this is a complex and sophisticated vintage of Unico. It grows in parcels of old vines rising up a north-facing hillside, the soil flecked with gypsum that has crystalized, glinting amidst the layers of limestone and clay. The wine itself layers cranberry, fig and black-mushroom flavors into its sleek richness and power while the structure remains tight as a drum, even at ten years of age. Built for the long haul. "
373,Crossbarn Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,55,14.5,0.0,0,"Blueberries, purple fruit and lavender. Crushed stones and raspberries, too. Medium-bodied and so fresh and vivid, with creamy tannins and a really long finish. Touch of vanilla. Just delicious. The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley) is packed with juicy dark berry fruit, mocha, chocolate and spice. This supple, racy Cabernet is another terrific wine from Crossbarn. The Napa Cabernet is quite a bit more plush and opulent than the Sonoma bottling, but both are terrific. Best After 2021. A value-priced, entry level wine from the talents of Paul Hobbs, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon sports a vivid purple hue as well as rock-solid notes of red and black currants, candied violets, incense, and tobacco. Beautifully textured and medium to full-bodied, with velvety tannins, it has a classic, round, sexy 2019 style that's already a joy to drink. Nevertheless, it's going to deliver the goods for at least 7-8 years. It's going to be up there with some of the top values in Napa Valley Cabernet. A nice, extroverted wine, with a bright beam of raspberry and red currant pâte de fruit driving through, laced with energetic anise, bramble and apple wood notes along the way. Juicy energy carries through the finish. Drink now. Almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon from valley-floor sites, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley offers up scents of raspberries and cherries, plus hints of pencil shavings and crushed herbs. It's medium to full-bodied, with a smooth, silky feel and some dusty tannins on the finish. Easy and approachable but structured enough to pare with rare beef or lamb, it's a good example of what can still be achieved in Napa at a reasonable price. "
374,Kanonkop Pinotage,2018,Pinotage,Africa,45,14.8,4.4,40,"The 2018 Pinotage comes from vines up to 65 years old, cropped at 5 tons/ha, and raised for 16 months in 80% new oak and 20% second fill. There is a little reduction on the nose, though this is brushed away with aeration to reveal black plum mixed with Christmas cake and a hint of licorice; fine delineation here. The palate is medium-bodied with impressive harmony and focus, the oak seamlessly integrated. There is fine backbone to this Pinotage, and a sustained white pepper finish that lingers. Outstanding. There’s a slight warmth to the nose of this wine, which opens with aromas of licorice root, char, baked plum and roasted blackberry alongside a touch of balsamic herbs and minty rooibos. It’s plush in feel and full in weight, with gripping tannins that support all of that ripe black fruit flavor. Ample acidity assists with balance, while the long finish shows beautiful evolution. Displaying a dark ruby core with purple and red hints on the rim, the 2018 Pinotage Stellenbosch opens with a nose of sweet, confected plums, black raspberry, mocha and hints of sweet oak spice. Medium to full-bodied, the wine displays sweet fruit on the palate with a generous helping of 80% new French oak. It ends with sappy plums and black cherry skin flavors that give way to tight tannins that linger on the long finish. There are plenty of winemaking practices happening with the expression that creates an enjoyable experience for the drinker. "

The palate is full-bodied and packed full of perfectly ripe, juicy fruit, with a grainy frame and loads of uplift on the finish. Very attractive aromas of blackberry, sweet tobacco and wet earth follow through to a full body with a round, soft texture. Smoke, tar and graphite notes. Flavorful finish. 60% syrah, 24% grenache, 12% petite sirah and 4% viognier. Drink or hold. "

377,Chateau Montrose,2010,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,309,14,4.4,24,"Deep garnet colored, the 2010 Montrose opens with classic notions of warm blackcurrants, plum preserves, cedar chest and pencil shavings plus touches of menthol and underbrush. Full-bodied, concentrated and built like a brick house in the mouth, the densely packed, muscular black fruit is superbly supported by firm, ripe, grainy tannins, finishing with great length and depth. And on to the tighter, more intellectual vintage of the two sparring partners of 2009 and 2010. You can feel the quality, the intensity, the more cerebral aspect of 2010 where the tannins are matched step for step by acidity and fruit. A wonderful wine, it will run and run and even now it floats somewhere on your palate, keeping itself hidden from view. If you want to understand why acidity can be a good thing, get to know Montrose 2010. There is an abundance of autumnal black fruit, certainly, even touches of bitter dark chocolate and dark pepper spicing, but this is going to unfurl at its own pace. Rock solid, displaying a dense core of plum, steeped currant and braised fig fruit, with racy charcoal and ganache notes. Intensely chalky, offering flesh and refinement to match the bracing minerality, this shows hints of grilled savory, iron, warm paving stone and bitter orange on the riveting finish. Should age very slowly. Best from 2019 through 2038. A perfumed and pure Montrose, with lots of currants, berries and spices that evolve to chocolate and light coffee. Full body, with super racy tannins and bright and clean finish. Very fine and structured. A balance and freshness to it all as well as beautiful form and tension. One of greatest kept secrets amongst the classifieds, the 2010 Ch Montrose is a wine destined to be one of all time greats; very concentrated and long, yet pure and un-compromised by the winemaking team. Plenty of power and thickness, yet refined in its red fruit and minerality. Look for this wine to rest well in the cellar and grow into an incredible wine for the dinner table. (Best Served: 2024-2040) "
378,Paul Hobbs Russian River Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,63,14.3,0.0,0,"Starts off subtle and taut, with crunchy citrus and pear flavors, flinty minerality and peppery white flower aromatics. Gains momentum and torque on the long finish, expanding into lemon zest and more mineral-driven nuances. Drink now through 2035. The 2020 Chardonnay Russian River Valley is sunny with golden pineapple, Meyer lemon, and wet stone. It has a delicately rounded feel on the palate without being weighted down, with fresh pear, orange pith, and green almond. "
379,Clarendon Hills Hickinbotham Cabernet Sauvignon,2005,Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,79,14.5,4.4,7,"The most backward and structured of the Cabernet offerings is the 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon Hickinbotham Vineyard sourced from 50-year-old vines. It is a glass-coating opaque purple with complex aromas of new oak, smoke, espresso roast, chocolate, blackberry, and black currant. Full-bodied, opulent and intensely flavored, the wine has great depth and enough structure to permit a decade of evolution. This lengthy effort should provide pleasure through 2035. At this young age, the oak is still not quite integrated, showing itself as smoky, bacony notes on the nose. But there's plenty of concentrated cassis fruit and this wine should settle down rapidly, yet remain drinkable through 2020. It's full bodied and tannic, but plush and nearly approachable even now. "
380,Gaja Darmagi,2009,Cabernet Sauvignon,Italy,269,13.5,0.0,0,"The 2009 Darmagi is unusually expressive and exuberant in this vintage. Juicy dark cherries, plums, menthol and grilled herbs bursts from the glass. It's hard to believe, but the 2009 is actually approachable today for the sheer radiance and generosity of its fruit. This is the rare vintage of Darmagi that is at once deeply varietally expressive yet also generous and inviting to a degree that is rarely seen with Cabernet Sauvignon in Piedmont. There is a lot to like here. "
381,Failla Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir,2021,Pinot Noir,California,41,13.8,4.5,10,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Failla Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir is bright and deftly combines fruit and earthy notes. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of ripe red fruit, hints of sandalwood, and blackberries. Pair it with mint leaves-infused, grilled lamb chops.

382,Silverado Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,60,14.3,4.2,40,"With some Merlot, Petit Verdot, and Caber- net Franc blended in, this standup Cabernet Sauvignon aged 17 months in primarily French oak, seeing some Hungarian and American oak as well. Sourced from the winery’s estate vineyards (Mt. George, Silverado, and Oakville Station), the fruit yielded tight-fisted tannins of coffee and plum skin that hold this superbly structured, concentrated, and elegant red together. Chewy, with earthy undertones and depth defined by dark choco- late and black olive. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Silverado Vineyards Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon is rich yet not overpowering. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of sandalwood, black fruit, licorice, and oak. Pair it with a steak salad. (Tasted: December 20, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Ripe cassis, toast, vanilla and spice nose. Sleek tannins and appetising acidity. Precisely defined blackcurrant and black plum flavours and well-integrated oak. Blend : 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot With small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc included, this elegant red shows graceful layers of plum, black cherry and currant built around a soft, supple midpalate. Approachable and youthful, it's a wine to enjoy in the near term. A strong young Napa Valley cabernet, this wine needs hours in a decanter for the tannins to begin to soften their grip. It slowly gives up that initial severity to yield notes of dried figs, gaining flesh to wrap around the tannins. There’s a good wine here that requires patient cellaring. "
383,Joel Gott Blend No. 815 Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,18,13.9,4.1,96,"Aromas of blackcurrants, blackberries, dark cherries, olives, licorice and dried thyme. Medium body with fine tannins. Juicy and savory. "

Full-bodied with a super intense bead of perfectly placed fruit and tannin. There’s slight firmness to the tannin at the end, so wait a year for perfect integration. Beautiful quality here. Not overly complex, but such good winemaking. Best from 2023. Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo Nero, this soft, full-bodied red has aromas of new leather, ripe plum and dark spice. On the enveloping, accessible palate, velvety tannins accompany fleshy black cherry, coconut and coffee bean before a bitter almond close.  "
385,Kapcsandy Family Winery State Lane Vineyard Roberta's Reserve,2019,Merlot,California,399,0,0.0,0,"Coming all from the estate vineyard in Yountville, the 2019 Roberta's Reserve is all Merlot that was brought up in 70% new French oak, with a scant 225 cases produced. It's another totally thrilling vintage for this cuvée and offers a Pomerol-like style in its red, blue, and black fruits as well as tobacco, cedary herbs, damp earth, and truffle-like aromas and flavors.

The lively, medium to full-bodied palate is completely filled with seductive, spicy fruit, framed by ripe, rounded tannins, finishing long and fragrant. Made from 100% Merlot, aged in 70% new French oak, the alcohol is 14.5%. "
386,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon (1.5 Liter Magnum),2014,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,429,14.5,4.9,5,"The 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon Cask 23 is a smoking effort from this team. Revealing a deep purple color and stunning notes of blackcurrants and black raspberries like fruit, it offers loads of spice, cedar and dried flower nuances, full-bodied richness, a ripe, full-bodied, majestic texture, beautiful tannin quality, and a great finish. This sensational 2014 has a rare mix of power and elegance and will keep for 20-25 years. Winemaker Marcus Notaro blends this wine from two adjacent estate-owned vineyards farmed by Kirk Grace. Fay, with its alluvial soils, provides 44 percent of the blend in 2014; the balance comes from S.L.V., where the vines rise higher up the eastern bench of Stag’s Leap, rooted in the crush of volcanic rock that has washed down off the palisades. They combine in a cabernet with cool richness, layering fruit notes of chocolate and wild mushrooms with a rush of satiny fruit tannins. There are no barriers to obscure the wine’s youthful integration or its complexity, still incipient, but there in the breath for minutes, compellingly fresh and satiating in its savor. Cask 23 is a selection of the finest barrels produced from the estate's vineyards. This is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in 90% new oak. The oak is very evident on the intense blackcurrant nose, yet it doesn't dominate. The palate is suave and broad, given texture with fine-grained tannins. There's impeccable balance and poise, and a long lingering finish, thanks to the wine's fine acidity. Glorious aromas of blacberries and blackcurrants follow through to a full body, ultra-fine tannins and an alluring finish. It shows such polish and verve. Try it in 2020, but it's already a show to taste. Shows the pedigree. Deftly balanced, creamy and smooth-textured, with an elegant array of red and dark berry, anise, cedar and mocha flavors, ending with fine-grained tannins and a splash of mocha.

Powerful, yet reined in by the vivid acidity, with tannins that are refined and well-integrated. Shows terrific balance and length.  Aromas of sweet berries and orange peel with some dried flowers. It’s medium-bodied with very fine tannins and a succulent finish. Nice citrus undertone here.  Poggio Landi sources grapes from three vineyard locations across the region, Montosoli, La Crociona and Castelverdelli. The 2016 Brunello di Montalcino has aromas of dried red plum, cedar, and pine resin. The palate has a profile of dried cherry, tomato leaf, and Mediterranean herbs, with refreshing acidity and drying tannins. The 2016 Brunello was aged for 38 months in large French oak.  "

389,Chateau Clinet,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,149,14,4.3,24,"Tasted on four separate occasions, the 2016 Château Clinet is another brilliant wine from this estate. Showing slightly more freshness and purity than the 2015, its saturated purple color is followed by a thrilling array of crème de cassis, graphite, ground herbs, and a terrific sense of minerality. Deep, full-bodied, with building tannins, and a magical sense of purity and elegance paired with real density and depth, it needs short term cellaring and will keep for three decades. The 2016 Clinet is composed of 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. It was aged using the Oxoline system, in 70% new and 30% one-year-old barrels for 16 months. It has a deep garnet-purple color with cedar and smoked meats on the nose giving way to black and red plums and earthy notions with wafts of cassis and pencil shavings. The palate is medium to full-bodied, elegant, polished and vivacious with loads of red and black fruit layers and an earthy finish. Around 4,416 cases produced. This is a wine that makes you want to slow down, take your time and let those flavours envelop you. It's a little subdued right now, but the texture pulls you in and holds on tight. There is Cabernet in the DNA here and you feel it: a touch of austerity in the first breath, then an intense punch of dark, tight cassis fruits with a liquorice and dark chocolate finish. It's taken on more flesh on the bones during ageing, with the aromatics blossoming through the glass and revealing floral, violet-stained edging and a silky smooth tannic frame. Drinking Window 2024 - 2040 Beautiful blue fruit and earth with hints of black truffle, this has a violet and fragrant edge, too. Really complex, youthful impression here. The palate has mouthwatering fruit flavor and terrific sense of fresh energy and cut on the finish. A blend of 90 per cent merlot and ten per cent cabernet sauvignon. Try from 2024. Warm and fleshy in feel, showing dark plum, boysenberry and blackberry sauce flavors infused with mulling spice and black tea notes. Singed alder and tobacco hints flicker on the finish, adding texture. This delivers an encore of fruit detail on the finish too, with some sneaky length. Seductive. Best from 2021 through 2034. Ripe and spicy, this is a dense wine with solid tannins. Black plum and blackberry flavors give the wine its fruitiness, while the spicy tannins promise aging. This powerful wine has a good future. Flowers, black cherries and a scant touch of pie crust sweetness are comfortably joined in the easy-going aromas of this slightly laid-back effort, and, rather than emphasizing amplified extract and sinewy strength, it is, at least for now, a Pomerol of propriety and tasteful understatement. It is, nonetheless, a wine that will age nicely by way of its careful composition with maturity arriving well in advance of its tenth anniversary. "
390,Angeline Cabernet Sauvignon,2020,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,15,14.1,3.7,31,"Currants, mushrooms, walnuts and orange peel. Dried orange, too. Medium-bodied with nice, juicy fruit and spice and earth. Easy and delicious, dry cabernet. Varietal. Drink now "

Crushed-stone and granite undertones. Rocky and salty. Calera clone. Drinkable now, but needs two or three years to open. Medium ruby-purple, the 2018 Pinot Noir Lansdale Block offers broody black and blue berries, turned earth, tar and violet top notes. The palate is medium-bodied, firmly structured and broody, packed with dark fruits and finishing long and fresh. This should age well in bottle. From a block of the Calera clone that yielded less than 1.3 tons per acre, this bottling offers aromas of boysenberry, iron, loam and gamy funk on the nose. Fairly heavy, rocky tannins frame the palate, where blistered black plum and more boysenberry meet with dried meat and lavender flavors. Drink 2021–2033. Vibrant red and blue fruits, spring flowers, blood orange, and graphite notes all emerge from the 2018 Pinot Noir Lansdale Block, which is medium-bodied and has a tight, focused texture, ripe tannins, and a great finish. Beautifully done, it’s going to benefit from 2-3 years of bottle age and keep for a decade. This wine smells of the mountains where the vines are planted—sun-warmed rocks and black plum flavors, along with violet scents, giving way to iron and dust. "

395,Giant Steps Yarra Valley Pinot Noir,2021,Pinot Noir,Australia,44,13.5,3.8,12,"60/40% upper/lower Yarra Valley fruit. Hand picked and open-fermented with 60% whole berries, the remainder whole bunches. A very bright, light–medium crimson red. A gentle waft of fresh raspberries and cranberries, with just the right amount of spice-rack spices. Delicious right out of the gate, this medium-bodied and refreshing wine will age well too.

Gorgeous black raspberry, spring flowers, bay leaf, sandalwood, and exotic spice notes characterize this rich, full-bodied, beautifully textured Côte Rôtie. With sweet yet present tannins, an expansive mouthfeel, and integrated oak, this stunning, young, unevolved 2017 will benefit from 2-3 years of bottle age and keep for 15 years or more. Lively, with lots of savory and iron streaks amidst the steeped cherry and plum fruit, ending with a flurry of mouthwatering mineral notes on the finish. Sleek and piercing in feel. Best from 2021 through 2036. "
397,Cesari Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,2016,Other Red Blends,Italy,59,15.3,4.1,31,"New leather, truffle, menthol and baked plum aromas slowly emerge on this inviting, full-bodied red. Smooth and savory, the velvety palate doles out fleshy black cherry, fig, tobacco and licorice alongside polished, enveloping tannin's. A slightly more accessible wine from a terrific vintage, the Cesari 2016 Amarone della Valpolicella Classico has lifted or volatile aromas of dried cherry skin and red apple.

The palate is dark fruited without weight, marked with dried blackberry, black tea, dried herbs, and classically balanced structure.

Savory mushrooms and olives, followed by firm, fine-grained tannins. Structured and full-bodied. Aromas of iron, blood and cherry lead off in this smooth and vibrant red, with a well of dark fruit—black cherry and blackberry—settling in on the palate. Offers a dusting of dark chocolaty tannins on the finish. Best from 2023 through 2043. 1,500 cases imported. Bringing together grapes from diverse vineyards throughout Montalcino, this midweight, almost-approachable Brunello is focused and vibrant. It takes a bit of coaxing on the nose then divulges sage, orange rind and fennel. Brisk acidity and chalky tannins meet crisp red currant and cranberry, cleansing the palate nicely. A delightful jumping off point to Val di Suga’s single-vineyard offerings, which COO and winemaker Andrea Lonardi has been refining since 2012. "
399,Miraval Rose,2021,Rosé,France,28,13,4.0,75,"Now jointly owned by Brad Pitt and the Stoli Group of vodka fame, this estate is run by the Perrin family of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. This is an impressive rosé, elegant with finely balanced fruit and texture. Citrus and raspberries shine through a taut structure. The aftertaste is crisp and fresh.

With full-bodied richness, moderate acidity, ripe, velvety tannins, and one heck of a great finish, it’s one of the gems in the vintage. Dark and brooding, this reveals layers of black fruit edged in iron and smoke. Tightly coiled on the palate, with highlights of violet, tea, forest floor and cumin emerging with time. Slightly grippy tannins hold firm, and this will benefit from a few years in the cellar for the full range of flavors to open up. Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre, Counoise and Vaccarèse. Plentiful brooding dark fruits, this is bold, rounded and powerful. Riper and deeper than many this year, with massy ripe tannins. The alcohol does seem a little high, but the acidity is balanced and it finishes long and intense. Grown on mixed soils, mostly galets roulés and sand, in the lieux-dits of Les Brusquières and Cabrières. Fermented half in stainless steel, half in concrete tanks, then aged in large barrels of different shapes and sizes. "
401,Ruinart Brut Rose (375ML,half-bottle),Sparkling Rosé,France,61,12.5,4.5,64,"A gorgeous rosé in a rich, vinous style, this shows a satiny mousse and well-honed acidity, which buoy a detailed range of macerated raspberry fruit, dried apricot, grated ginger, graphite and chopped roasted almond flavors. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Drink now through 2025. A blend of 55% Pinot Noir and 45% Chardonnay, and featuring around 25% reserve wines, this is 100% premier cru fruit from the Montagne des Reims and Côte des Blancs. Almost a third of the Pinot Noir was vinified as a still wine. A deep coral colour, this is fresh and youthful, with rounded wild red berry fruit, and hint of rose. With some time in the glass, it develops deeper, complex, more exotic notes, leading to a long and lively finish. Dosage: 8g/L. Rather dark-colored with cherry, watermelon and stone undertones. Full-bodied and layered, with iron and strawberry at the end. Drink now. This blends chardonnay (45 percent) and pinot noir (55 percent, of which 19 percent was vinified as red wine). They come together in a lasting essence of roses and wild strawberries, the wine’s fruit complexity amplified by the sensation of acidity, with its fine limestone abrasion. A clean, simple beauty from Champagne. The latest rendition of Ruinart's NV Brut Rosé is a pretty, vibrant wine that offers up inviting aromas of tangerine, blood orange, plum and freshly baked bread. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and precise, with tangy acids and a pretty mousse, it's ca harming, comparatively vinous wine that is already showing well. "
402,Chateau Fuisse Pouilly-Fuisse Tete de Cuvee,2019,Chardonnay,France,51,13.5,4.5,6,"This is rich, yet open and fluid, boasting peach, vanilla, toasted brioche and lemon flavors. Pulls together nicely on the finish, courtesy of its crisp acidity, with fine length. Sneaks up on you. Drink now through 2025. 900 cases imported. A touch of wood frames the mildly reduced aromas of white flowers, pear and discreet citrus nuances so I would suggest giving this some air first. There is good volume to the energetic and rich medium-bodied flavors that display solid power on the muscular, youthfully austere, bone-dry and lingering finish. This is very good and worth considering. "

404,Segura Viudas Reserva Heredad Cava,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Spain,30,12,4.0,281,"Aromas of brioche and lemon verbena intertwined with brine, tarragon, and honeysuckle keep you enthralled before the first sip. Persistent bubbles pave the way for a parade of florals and light, airy flavors touched with smoke. Minerality ensues on the mid-palate, where it’s joined by notes of bread dough, lemon, lime chiffon, and vanilla. A selection of macabeo and parellada grown at estate vineyards in the Alt Penedès, Reserva Heredad is a complex and heady Cava that delivers on its richness without sweetness. Its potent depth of flavor has a smoky minerality and fresh apple-skin notes. This is full and meaty enough to serve with roast chicken or albóndigas de ternera (veal meatballs).

407,Azelia Barolo,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,54,14.5,4.1,24,"Fascinating aromas of ripe strawberry, bark, mushroom and black tea follow through to a full body with round, creamy tannins that are juicy and rather punchy. Try after 2024. Sourced from seven parcels across Castiglione Falletto and Serralunga d’Alba, the 2017 Barolo reveals medicinal aromatics of menthol, dried cherry, and nutmeg. The palate is angular with gripping structure and noted by cranberry cocktail, tea leaf, and orange citrus. This 2017 is classically built within the warmth of the vintage. Fruit for this spicy Barolo comes from seven single crus in Serralunga d’Alba and Castiglione Falletto. Firm, polished tannins frame the red-cherry and strawberry flavors, and the acidity is well integrated, drawing out those red fruit tones on a long and lively finish. The Azelia 2017 Barolo is fine and elegant, opening to a pretty ruby color that catches the ambient light. To the nose, it offers cherry and wild rose with licorice and campfire ash. You do notice the extra heft and dryness of the tannins, especially when the wine is tasted before its ideal drinking window. Luigi Scavino's classic Barolo is a blend of seven vineyard sites: Altenasso and Solanotto in Castiglione Falletto; a part of Cerretta; the youngest vines in Bricco Voghera that are 55 to 60 years old (the fruit from the 90-year-old plants goes to the Riserva); and parts of San Rocco, Cerrati and Broglio in Serralunga d'Alba. Aromas of wild berry, eucalyptus and fennel seed mingle with blue flower. On the austere palate, tightly wound tannins accompany sour cherry, blood orange and licorice before a firm, rather lean finish. "
408,Penfolds Bin 407 Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,79,14.5,4.7,5,"An amalgam of redcurrant and blackcurrant aromas with cedary and leafy tones, dark berries and pepper and plenty of oak strut. The palate has a deep vein of black-fruit flavors, as well as plum and chocolate. Bold extract. A blend of Padthaway, Coonawarra, Wrattonbully, McLaren Vale and Barossa Valley. Drink now. Polished from top to bottom, this red boasts fine-grained tannins, offering a generous core of blackberry and cassis flavors that show accents of cured black olive, sandalwood and vanilla-laced cedar, with a whiff of peppermint and dried sage, all harmonious on the long finish. Drink now through 2035.  While the 2019 Bin 407 Cabernet Sauvignon shows ample concentration and ripe tannins, there's a pervasive herbal note. While some will call it Cabernet's varietal character—and I won't dispute that a bit of pyrazine is indeed endemic to the Cabernet family of grapes—balance is key. To this taster, there's just a bit too much mint and other green stuff for me to go gaga over the 2019 Bin 407. It's still an excellent wine, with plenty of weedy cassis fruit, a ripe, lush feel on the medium to full-bodied palate and a velvety, dark-chocolate finish. Sourced from Padthaway, Coonawarra, Wrattonbully, McLaren Vale and Barossa Valley, it spent a year in a combination of French and American hogsheads. "
409,Chateau Cantenac Brown,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,61,13.5,4.6,7,"Ripe black fruits shine through this balanced wine, showing strongly against a backdrop of rich, generous tannins. This estate is one to watch as it achieves the form the vineyard deserves. Expect this wine to be ready to drink from 2026. Shows a touch of dark earth out front, with a mix of smoldering tobacco, espresso crema and singed alder notes before the core of warmed plum and blackberry reduction flavors finally starts to unwind. Just a touch burly for a Margaux, but certainly lots to like here and ample range and length. Time will likely add that last bit of refinement. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Rich and polished aromas of blueberry, lavender, dark chocolate, hazelnut and sweet tobacco. It’s full-bodied with firm, velvety tannins. Creamy layers of ripe fruit and wood. Long and caressing. Lovely ripe fruit in the center palate. Try from 2024. This is delicious, silky in texture and filled with luscious black fruits, exotic spiced liquorice and sweet blackberry. Touches of grilled cedar and just a trace of heat appear at the final furlong, along with a hint of menthol. The tannins close their fist around the fruit, reflecting the small berry size in the Cabernets, the percentage of which is slightly up this year as new plantings have come on line. It's an impressive construction, a little less elegant than the 2016 but with a ton of personality and a sense of bursting out of its borders, not yet fully tamed - and hugely appealing as a result. 60% new oak barrels. Drinking Window 2027 - 2042. A classic, elegant Margaux based on roughly 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot (I don't know the exact blend), the 2018 Château Cantenac Brown offers up a pretty perfume of red and black currants, sandalwood, dried flowers, and cedar pencil. It's not the most powerful or concentrated wine in the vintage, yet it has fine tannins as well as a wonderfully balanced, classical style. I suspect it will benefit from just short-term cellaring and keep for 20-25 years. "

Medium-bodied with crisp acidity and a fresh, creamy palate. Excellent length. 70% semillon and 30% sauvignon blanc. Drink now or hold. Pure white peach, tart pineapple, white flowers, and chalky mineral notes all emerge from the 2019 Clos Des Lunes Lune D'Argent Blanc, a Semillon-dominated, medium-bodied, concentrated, wonderfully textured white. This is well worth your time and money, and I suspect it will have a decade of longevity. Best After 2022	 "

Most of the volume fermented in stainless steel with some 10% in concrete vats, and the final blend matured for 22 months in French oak barrels, 80% of them new, and 10% in Stockinger vats. It's 13.5% alcohol and has good acidity and freshness, coming through as medium-bodied, elegant and balanced. This is incredibly elegant, subtle and harmonious even at this early stage. It has floral aromas, notes of orange peel, a touch of creamy sweet spices and great freshness. The palate is medium-bodied, seamless and pure, with pungent flavors and a soft texture. It's long, clean, defined and super tasty. I feel this wine is getting better and better by the vintage. The grapes were picked quite early, and that helped to contain the ripeness and seems to have been a great decision. There was also an exception in the Panquehue zone where the Seña vines are, where the summer was cooler than the average, so quite different to many other regions in Chile. Such beautiful aromas of crushed berries, currants, walnuts, allspice and nutmeg follow through to a full body with tight, ultra fine tannins that provide length and intensity. A finish of slightly dried cherries with wet earth, slate and stone. Chewy and fine-grained. A wine with soul and length. Give it time. Drink after 2025. The twenty-fifth vintage of a wine first made in 1995 by the Mondavi and Chadwick families is one of Francisco Baettig’s best editions yet: 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Malbec, 15% Carmenere and Petit Verdot aged for 22 months in French oak (10% in foudres). The nose offers redcurrant, blackberry, and cherry over a bed of sweet spices, cedar and peppers. Dense core and firm grip, it needs to be decanted or left in the bottle for a while longer. The 2019 Seña 25 Años is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Malbec, 15% Carménère and 4% Petit Verdot from Aconcagua Costa. The wine was aged for 22 months, 10% in foudres and the rest in French barrels. A vivid purple in hue, the complex, subtle nose opens up gradually, delivering layer after layer of blackcurrants. Touches of sweet and sour cherry, a twist of raspberry, sweet spices and notes from the aging process, such as nutmeg and cedar, fill the palate. Relaxed in the mouth, the 2019 Seña begins with a juicy, well-integrated freshness that feels light as silk, accompanied by extremely finely grained yet young tannins that sculpt the flow, promising excellent aging potential. The finish lingers long, repeating aromas of blackcurrant and sour cherry. Boasts vibrant red cherry and berry flavors, which are well-knit and bear a minerally richness. The juicy finish features accents of dried green herbs and is supported by engaging tannins. Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Carmenère and Petit Verdot.

414,Louis Jadot Macon-Villages,2020,Chardonnay,France,16,13,3.7,98,"This balanced and classic wine is creamy, with an abundance of citrus accents from lemon curd and lemon blossom to tangerine sorbet. Minerality plays a starring role alongside fine acidity. "

416,Angeline Russian River Pinot Noir,2020,Pinot Noir,California,25,13.6,3.6,24,"Aromas of cherries, ripe raspberries, toasted bread and baking spices with mushroom undertones. Medium body with fine tannins and bright acidity. Lively and sharp on the palate with a fresh, dry finish. Drink now. "
417,Joel Gott Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,California,16,13.9,3.9,62,"This light, fresh white is overtly citrusy, with lime zest, tangerine and makrut lime leaf flavors that are light on their feet but plenty intense, showing notes of lemon verbena and lemongrass on the finish.

419,Col di Lamo Brunello di Montalcino,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,42,0,4.4,9,"A complex nose of dried mushrooms, crushed shells and bark. Hints of dried rosemary and thyme give this mouth-watering savoriness. Juicy dark berries and mushrooms on the palate. It's full-bodied with firm tannins. Chewy. The 2016 Brunello has baked aromas of fig, tar and turned earth. The palate is savory with tea leaf, cherry pit, and pine resin. It is full-bodied and rich with ripe tannin and warming spice. Col di Lamo is an organic estate. Col di Lamo was established by Giovanna Neri when she parted ways with her brother Giacomo Neri of Casanova di Neri in the mid-1990s. From two small vineyards in Montalcino’s northeastern zone of Torrenieri she fashions this satisfyingly chewy, slightly rustic yet flavourful Brunello. It’s packed with dark fruit and offset by wildflower, forest floor, cinnamon and clove. Clayey tannins grip the palate and zesty, citrussy acidity brings it to its close. "
420,Kendall-Jackson Grand Reserve Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,18,14.5,4.1,9,"One hundred percent barrel fermented, the 2020 Chardonnay Grand Reserve is characterized by floral aromatics of honeysuckle, salted pineapple, and lemon.

421,Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1.5 Liter Magnum),2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,499",13,0.0,0,"Deep and typical on the nose with blackcurrants, black tea, leather and graphite. The aromas draw you down to the palate. Full-bodied, creamy and beautiful with extremely polished, refined tannins. Yet, it’s powerful and long. Highest percent of cabernet sauvignon ever. Juicy and almost exotic, but very tidy with ripe tannins. Try after 2025 and onwards. This wine is poised, gathering freshness and good acidity in the same structured container as the pure black-currant fruits. With 97% Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine has a classicism about it: fruity and structured at the same time. Drink from 2024. Deep ruby in colour but not so inky as to be impenetrable - that is not their style. Nose subdued at first, but on the palate it unfurls to show violet edging and rich but well defined black fruits. Lafite never tries overly hard to please everyone in its early years, and this will take some time to open up. There is plenty of concentration - there are hefty tannins but they are so finessed that you don't feel them at first. It will almost certainly take a full ten years to reach its drinking window, unlike many in 2017. Its 97% Cabernet Sauvignon means a lot of the power is implied at this point, with only a hint of Merlot to soften and gently layer up through the palate. Extremely impressive. A yield of 40hl/ha, only very lightly affected by frost. 99% new oak. 3.75pH. This is a youthful tumble of warmed black currant, fig and blackberry paste flavors, entwined with bay leaf, tobacco, savory, lilac, smoldering charcoal and warm cast iron notes. Terrific stony minerality zips everything up for now, but riveting acidity and excellent energy should carry this easily in the cellar. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Best from 2025 through 2040. The grand vin 2017 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild checks as a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated blend that includes just 2.5% Merlot and less than 1% of Petit Verdot, brought up in new French oak. It shows the classy, elegant style of both the vintage and the estate, revealing a ruby/purple hue, complex notes of red and black currants, lead pencil, and cedary herbs, medium-bodied richness and depth, and both present tannins and acidity. It checks in behind the 2015 and 2016 yet is nevertheless a classic Lafite. It will benefit from a decade of bottle age and keep for 30 years or more. "
422,Chateau Branaire-Ducru,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,79,13.5,4.2,55,"The core of this red is loaded with pure plum, blueberry and black currant fruit flavors. The polished structure is integrated, with alluring ganache, anise and sweet tobacco notes throughout, all in a polished and balanced frame. A very classy red that isn't shy about its power but pushes its purity to the fore. Best from 2024 through 2039. The best vintage of this wine since 2009! Effusive, fresh redcurrant and cassis aromas give this St.-Julien terrific drive and energy, the elegant, dry tannins beautifully married to the medium body, right through the long, agile finish. Drink or hold. You can immediately see the quality and the depth of the 2016 vintage in the complexity of the expression and construction. Bottled in early July, extremely rich and full of black brambly hawthorn-edged fruits. The quality of the tannins is extremely impressive, there are lots of them, and they build over the course of the palate, but they are not constraining, and have a fine texture. After five minutes in the glass the blackcurrant fruit starts to come out. The tannins close in again on the finish, suggesting there is a long life ahead. A vintage that is so good for St Julien, not to be missed. Drinking Window 2026 - 2042 "
423,Sequoia Grove Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,56,14.2,4.0,11,"Plums, currants, stones, sage and walnut husks on the nose. Some toffee and mocha. Medium- to full-bodied with polished tannins. Creamy finish. Drink after 2023. "
424,Castello Romitorio Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,275,15,0.0,0,"The 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva lifts up with elegance and richness, as sweet lavender and violets give way to a more savory display of black cherries, Tuscan dust and cedar box with hints of cooling mint. This rushes the palate with sweet red fruits and spices, silky yet lifted, and displaying a delicacy not expected from the Riserva category, yet quite welcome. Beneath is a core of power and density just waiting to unfold. Minerality comes through in the finale, mingling with a fine coating of tannin and hints of spicy citrus. This harmonious Brunello will have a very long life. The Riserva is a selection of two Brunello barrels, one tonneau and one large cask, from Romitorio’s cellar. Simply stunning. Drinking Window: 2026 - 2038. The 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva (with 6,300 bottles made) works beautifully to produce a lasting sense of harmony that reflects the best qualities of this classic vintage. Part of that playlist is power, and indeed this wine registers 15% alcohol, which is high, but the freshness of these vineyard sites and the wine's acidity does a good job of mitigating that power. The fruit is polished and refined in this Riserva, and there is a pretty mix of both primary and even some distant tertiary character to shape a bouquet that is pure but also complex. Castello Romitorio harvests in two stages. The first is an early selection of the smallest, loosest bunches across the oldest vineyards and fills one single tank. In years when the estate Brunello can stand alone, this is bottled separately as a Riserva. The tenth since 1987, the 2016 is wondrously earthy in its overture of clay, mineral rock and iron. It evolves into an autumnal smokiness then lands on balsamic herbs and crunchy red woodland berries. Youthful vigor and verve do not conceal intrinsic finesse. Acid crunch and dramatic mouth-caressing tannins will see this through the long haul. Drinking Window: 2024 - 2038. "
425,Vie di Romans Piere Sauvignon Blanc,2019,Sauvignon Blanc,Italy,37,14.19,4.2,9,"The purity of fruit in this is really something, offering salt, chalk, sliced mango and papaya. It’s full and phenolic with layers of fruit and so much richness at the end. Yet, it’s ever so long and intense. Lasts for minutes. Drink or hold. "
426,Tenuta di Nozzole Chianti Classico Riserva,2019,Sangiovese,Italy,22,14,3.9,7,"This has intense spice and and floral character, with violets, bell peppers, morello cherries, cloves and tomato leaves on the nose. It’s medium-bodied with sleek tannins. Dense and compact palate. Some walnut notes at the end. "
427,Zenato Valpolicella Superiore Ripassa,2018,Other Red Blends,Italy,32,14,4.0,28,"A rather deep nose, with a mineral twist jumping out from the black chocolate and tarry blackberries. Quite juicy on the medium-to full-bodied palate, rounded by firm and resolved tannins. Attractive freshness to the dark-berry fruit in the finish. Enticing smoke and spice notes on the nose underscore flavors of baked blackberry, cured tobacco, bacon fat and rich earth in this sculpted red. Packs a rich profile on a medium- to full-bodied frame, yet this is well-balanced and poised, thanks to fresh acidity, a minerally underpinning and fine-grained tannins. Corvina, Rondinella and Corvinone. Best from 2023. The 2018 Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso Ripassa is peppery with earth tones and crushed stone giving way to black cherries and savory herbs. There are depths of silken textures here offset by brisk acids, as ripe red and black fruits resonate under an air of lavender. This is so concentrated and intense, yet communicating elegance, while leaving the palate fresh with hints of violet candies that linger. The 2018 will need a short stay in the cellar to develop its aromatics. Well done. "
428,Bodegas Valderiz Ribera del Duero,2019,Tempranillo,Spain,31,15,4.0,21,"A harmonious red that marries power with finely detailed grace, showing a
dense core of tannins tightly meshed with flavors of ripe black currant, fig
cake, wild sage and mocha that slowly unfurl on the palate. Sleek and silky in texture, with a firm and lingering, well-spiced finish. "
429,Graham's Six Grapes Reserve Ruby,Port,Port,Portugal,25,19.5,4.1,610,"Ripe and opulent plummy fruit on the nose, big and bold. Well extracted deep fruits on the palate framed by well balanced tannins and freshness. The Graham's Six Grapes has always been one of my favorites amongst the reserve Portos. Deep, rich, and satiny, this one drinks smooth and long. I would pair it with more decadent desserts such as dark chocolate mousse or thick mocha cheesecake. (Tasted: October 25, 2016, San Francisco, CA) "
430,Parusso Barolo Perarmando,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,62,0,0.0,0,"A rich nose, packed with aromas of ripe and dried red fruit, including heaps of wild strawberries. There’s fresh orange rind, too and on the savory side, notes of cloves, perfumed bark and brighter flowers. Full-bodied with a very silky but firm texture. The strawberry and citrus fruit is ingrained in the velvety tannins and the combination gives a very long finish. Twist of red licorice at the end. This is nicely structured and well balanced, but needs plenty of time. This wine very much embraces the signature Parusso style that always puts an emphasis on elegant power and dark fruit. The 2018 Barolo Perarmando is dedicated to the estate founder, Armando Parusso, and represents a blend of Bussia, Mosconi and Mariondino. The bouquet reveals dried rose and flower petal, with fruit stems, dark fruit, licorice and smoke. This edition is lighter than pasts vintages, especially in terms of its relatively mild mid-palate (milder compared to other Parusso Barolos). Best After 2025 "

432,Chateau Rauzan-Segla,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,139,13.5,4.5,19,"The aromas of blackcurrants, sweet tobacco and sandalwood are tantalizing. Then it turns to subtle, dried fruit. Full-bodied with dense and powerful tannins, yet ending with finesse and vertical nature. Very deep. Power with finesse. Try after 2025. I continue to love the 2016 Rauzan-Ségla, a thrillingly complete, flawlessly balanced, and borderline perfect Margaux that should be snatched up by readers. Notes of cassis, graphite, tobacco leaf, and earth all give way to a full-bodied effort that has building tannins, no hard edges, and a level of purity and elegance that’s just about off the charts. Given its purity and balance, it’s accessible today, but it will be best with 4-5 years of bottle age and keep for 3-4 decades. Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2016 Rauzan-Ségla drifts effortlessly from the glass with fragrant rose hip tea, candied violets and chocolate box scents over a core of fresh blackcurrants and black cherry compote plus wafts of tobacco and dusty soil. Medium to full-bodied, it delivers a great mid-palate of softly textured black and blue fruits with loads of floral nuances and a refreshing lift on the finish. The blend this year is 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 2% Petit Verdot, harvested between September 20th and October 15th at an average yield of 45 hectoliters per hectare. It was aged for 18 months in French oak, 60% new. The alcohol is 13.5%. This has a lovely core of creamy anise-infused plum, blackberry and boysenberry flavors that showcase themselves a bit more vividly than many Margaux peers in this vintage do, with substantial but velvety grip and lots of extra violet, graphite and black tea notes adding to the long flow of a finish. Really beautiful feel. Best from 2023 through 2038. There's an array of flavours and complex aromatics on offer here. It's powerful and brooding, with a lyrical acidity that helps to lift up the relatively foursquare tannins on the attack. After a few minutes in the glass it begins to ripple with menthol, liquorice root, grilled cedar and sweet spices. It needs time to settle, of course, but is extremely classic, and will go the distance and then some. Matured in 60% new oak. "
433,Lucien Albrecht Cremant d'Alsace Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,France,25,12,4.1,688,"In this wine, a subtle palate of rye crumb, red apple and lemon follows a subued nose.

Pretty nose of fresh strawberry, raspberry and orange blossom. Very bright on the medium-bodied palate, with a nice interplay of lively mousse with juicy fruit. Long, clean finish. "
434,Chateau Canon,2010,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,159,0,4.5,11,"Wonderful nose with strawberries, cherry blossom, and vanilla. The red opens up with blueberries, milk chocolate and sweet licorice. Full and juicy on palate with pure dark fruit and velvety tannins. So nicely layered texture and long in the finish with red fruit and crushed chalk. The texture is superb. soaked currant fruit and dark blackberry paste flavors. The tannins are dense but velvety, and the finish cascades nicely. A bit of panache here, but this pulls it off.

436,Tolaini Al Passo Toscana,2018,Tuscan Blends,Italy,27,14,3.9,54,"This is a fantastic red with so much cherry, currant, ash, tobacco, earth and walnut aromas. It’s full and layered with firm tannins that provide form, texture and structure. Linear and long. Really excellent for the vintage. Give it two or three years to come together, but already a beauty. Try after 2024. The 2018 Al Passo is another appealing wine in the Tolaini range. Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon work well together in this blend. Bright and punchy, the 2018 bristles with energy from start to finish. Ripe red/purplish berry fruit, rose petal, spice, mint and blood orange build effortlessly.

447,MacRostie Sonoma Coast Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,26,14.5,3.7,23,"Peach, apricot and mango notes are pure, intense and extremely juicy on a fleshy, succulent frame, with hints of spice, orange blossom and dried ginger. "
448,SuNu Matteri Vineyard Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,Oregon,79,13.2,0.0,0,"A very foresty nose with wild herbs, flowers, leaves and bracken, wrapped into dried red-cherry aromas. The palate has a very composed shape and pleasantly sinewy tannins are thrust forward in the mix. Supple and smoothly resolved at the finish. The 2017 Pinot Noir Matteri Vineyard Clone #115/777 has reticent scents of violet, dried flowers and dusty earth with a core of red and black berries. Medium-bodied, it's silky, juicy and delicate, finishing long.  "
449,Tornatore Etna Bianco,2021,Carricante,Italy,25,0,4.2,22,"Medium-bodied. Steady and bright on the palate. Subtle, smoky flavor mixes well with fresh and dried-herb notes. Sustainable. Drink now. A perfumed white, with white blossoms and ripe fruit on the nose, this is salty and mouthwatering on the palate. Offers a touch of lemon zest enlivening flavors of Asian pear, blanched almond, chamomile and lemon oil.  "
450,Aldo Conterno Barolo Bussia,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,120,14.5,0.0,0,"This is so aromatic and beautiful with cherry, berry, hazelnut and Indian spices. It’s full-bodied with firm, velvety tannins that show form and brilliance. It’s extremely long and sophisticated. Tight at the finish. Try after 2024. A chameleonlike red, with hallmark aromas and flavors of tomato sauce, cherry, macerated plum, iron and wet hay. The ripe fruit gets sweeter in this red as it builds to the vice grip of tannins on the finish, with the sweet fruit returning in the end. The Poderi Aldo Conterno 2017 Barolo Bussia shows a dark but busy quality of fruit that speaks more to the power of this hot vintage than it does the nuanced side of Nebbiolo. In this respect, the wine is quite typical of the 2017 growing season. It takes a while before the wine finds focus in the glass, but it does slowly come together to reveal broad layers of dark cherry, cassis and plum. There is some tannic tightness that leads to sour berry. A bit awkward at this young stage, it needs a few more years of cellar age to flesh out and reach balance. "
451,Shannon Ridge High Elevation Zinfandel,2020,Zinfandel,California,23,13.9,3.6,20,"Great black fruit flavors and a warm, broad texture are well supported by moderate tannins in this full-bodied, ripe and pleasing wine. Black plum, blackberry and a touch of black pepper are all vivid on the palate and lingering on the finish. "
452,Vasse Felix Filius Cabernet Sauvignon,2020,Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,28,14.5,3.6,10,"Offers wild berry flavors that are plush and elegant, which mingle with forest floor, sage, dried mushroom, palo santo and a touch of peppermint oil. Delivers tannins that are supple and creamy, with an elegant yet powerful profile. Heady notes of sweetly spiced oak and chocolate mingle with cassis, violet and mint. Tannins are a little chunky, and acid- ity is pinched, but there’s lovely savory spice and red fruit tang right through to the finish. A solid, youthful Cab bearing the classic Vasse style, but this reviewer recommends paying a bit extra for the winery’s self-named middle tier bottling. "
453,Lini 910 Labrusca Lambrusco,Rosso,Red Sparkling Wine,Italy,17,11,3.9,228,"The NV Rosso Labrusca lifts up with a decadent blend of ripe cherries, blueberries, sweet herbs and spice. This takes a turn toward the savory spectrum on the palate, as zesty acids and salty minerals enliven the tart wild berry fruits within. Violet florals resonate through the finale, along with hints of sour citrus that maintain lively freshness. "
454,Patz & Hall Dutton Ranch Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,California,51,14.5,0.0,0,"James Hall selects the fruit for this wine from 11 blocks farmed by the Dutton family. Most of the vines are older plantings of heritage clones and selections, a mix that seems to respond to a slow, spontaneous fermentation and development in French oak barrels (35 percent new). The 2018 builds to a savory and ornate chardonnay, a wine with traction that digs into scents of violets and game, jasmine and butterscotch, giving a sweet impression without any actual sweetness. There’s yellow and orange citrus fruit, but the main impression is earthy, with notes of lobster mushroom and lobster broth in a mineral finish. It’s floral, clean, intense wine, with stature and resistance to oxygen. Decant it for crab Louis, or cellar it for years. Aromatic in a richness of caramelized brioche and baked lemon, the layers of flavor in this full-bodied, voluptuous wine follow suit, providing plenty of length and opulence. A buttery back note adds to the complex, appealing intensity. The 2018 Chardonnay Dutton Ranch has aromas of red apple peel, white pepper and honeysuckle with notions of baker's yeast and spices. Medium-bodied, it has a good core of nutty fruits with a long, gently leesy finish. "
455,Rombauer Chardonnay (375ML half-bottle),2021,Chardonnay,California,21,14.5,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Rombauer Vineyards Chardonnay deftly combines fruit, barrel, and acidity for a delicious wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of tropical fruit, oak notes, and tart apples. Enjoy it with grilled bone-in chicken thighs. (Tasted: July 18, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "
456,Chateau Rauzan-Segla,2010,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,159,14,4.5,49,"Beautiful clarity of fruit with raspberries and currants on the nose. Roses and other flowers too. It's almost hard to describe, but there's a real purity. Full body, with fabulous balance and depth. It has everything in the right place. Best ever? Try it in 2018. A wine that could easily be mistaken for a First Growth, the 2010 Rauzan-Ségla is an incredibly powerful, full-bodied wine by this estate’s standards, yet it nevertheless holds onto a terrific sense of elegance as well as perfect balance. A huge nose of blackcurrants, smoked earth, tobacco, lead pencil, and spice give way to a concentrated, blockbuster styled Margaux that has thrilling depth of fruit, masses of ripe tannins, and great length and finesse on the finish. This brilliant wine is just now seemingly on the edge of its drink window and offers immense pleasure, yet it has another 30-40 years of life ahead of it. Along with the 2015 and 2016, it’s the greatest wine made at this estate in the past two decades. Deep garnet in color, the 2010 Rauzan-Ségla is youthfully reticent and closed to begin, slowly unfurling to offer notions of underbrush, black truffles, smoked meats and tar over a core of baked black cherries, prunes and crème de cassis plus touches of iron ore and crushed rocks. Full-bodied, concentrated and jam-packed with savory/earthy fruit, it has a rock-solid structure of firm, grainy tannins and oodles of freshness, finishing with great length and expression. The blend this year is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot, harvested between September 23rd and October 19th, at an average yield of 37 hectoliters per hectare. It was aged for 18 months in French oak, 60% new. The alcohol is 14%. Extremely good quality, a wonderfully accomplished, impressive Margaux where you feel so happy to be tasting it. It delivers accomplished impressive classified Bordeaux character. Black fruits, liquorice, smoke and pulsating tannins. Just so elegant, so Rauzan, just at the beginning of its drinking window. 60% new oak. Flashy style of Margaux, with alluring warm cocoa and black tea aromatics followed by cashmere-textured plum sauce, steeped fig and blackberry confiture notes. The well-integrated structure makes this seem almost accessible now, but the ample length and a smoldering tobacco note make a case for cellaring. Best from 2014 through 2030. "
457,Rose & Arrow Hopewell Hills Gathered Stones Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,Oregon,120,13,4.2,6,"Graceful and seamlessly complex, with multilayered cherry and blueberry flavors that take on river stone and spiced tea accents, building tension toward fine-grained tannins. The 2017 Pinot Noir Hopewell Hills—Gathered Stones comes from a particular piece of the Hopewell Hills vineyard. Medium ruby-purple, it opens with tar and scorched earth notes over a core of blackberries, black cherries, smoked cranberries and baked rhubarb with accents of orange peel, dried roses, tea leaves and bitters. The palate is medium-bodied, super silky and intense, unfurling to layers of fruits, spices and citrus with earthy touches. It has a firm but ripe frame and seamless freshness on the long, nuanced finish. Lovely! Make sure to decant this or give it another year or two in bottle. 244 cases were made. "
458,Patrimony Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,279,14.9,0.0,0,"Deep, rich and plush on the nose showing cassis, blackberries with hints of dark olives, fennel, dark chocolate, cigar box and elderberry characters. Full-bodied and fleshy on the palate with an abundance of tannins, which are extremely fine-grained. Restrainedly opulent, deep, structured and long.  "
459,Chateau Hyot,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,14,13.5,3.7,40,"A very rich and ripe red for this appellation. Full-bodied, round and juicy with ripe and round tannins. Dark-berry, brick and stone undertones. "
460,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon,2009,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,379,13.5,0.0,0,"A great example of a modern Napa Cabernet coming into its own. After more than a decade of unfurling it reveals lovely, bramble, menthol and mint aromas. A classic Cabernet palate of cassis, blackberry and raspberry framed by a fresh, lifted herbal quality that echoes the nose. This blend of the best components of the Fay and SLV vineyards was fermented in 100% stainless steel then spent 20 months in 90% new French oak. Drinking Window 2020 - 2040 A big, vital wine, mouth-filling and dense, with plenty of weight and volume, and deep flavors of earth, chocolate, blackberry and sweet currant. The cool ’09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008. It’s not quite as fat or immediately accessible as those vintages, but it is very fine, and should reward at least 10 years in the cellar, although you can certainly drink it now after a few hours in the decanter. Shows impressive elegance, refinement, detail and complexity, with subtle currant, dried berry, dried herb and cedar notes, ending with a long graceful finish. Drink now through 2024. "
461,Roederer Estate Brut (375ML,half-bottle),Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,California,16,12.5,4.0,109,"Seamless and silky, showing an almost effortless sense of complexity, with notes of lemon and pear paired with toasty brioche, fresh ginger and hazelnut details. Drink now. The current release of the NV Estate Brut is made up mainly of fruit from the 2015 vintage. It is a blend of 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir and was made with about ten grams per liter dosage. Disgorged in October of 2018, it has a fresh, open nose with pure fruit expression: crushed apples, pears and lemon peel mingle with touches of stone, flowers and toast. The medium-bodied palate offers a lovely dichotomy of toasty fruits with uplifted citrusy, minerally accents with a finely beaded mousse, and it finishes long and ultra fresh. The iconic Quarted blend of Chardonnay (60%) and Pinot Noir (40%) with two years in contact with the lees. From fog-shrouded Anderson Valley this shows supreme elegance, balance and poise. Pale straw colour. Attractive notes of citrus fruits, fresh dough, cashew nuts, star fruit, Mirabelle plum and fresh biscuits on the nose. The palate dry with a lovely creamy texture, amazing finesse and sophistication, followed by an assertive and refreshing finish. Extremely fresh and floral with sliced apples, stones and some white peach. Bread dough, too. Fine bead. Medium to full body with crisp acidity and a steely finish. Hints of phenolics provide a fine texture. Vibrant acidity. About 15% reserve wine (mostly chardonnay) in this, from five vintages. 2.5 years on the lees. 60% chardonnay and 40% pinot noir. Drink or hold This crisp, fruity and citrus-accented wine has plenty of green apple and lemon flavors, brisk bubbles and a clean, tangy finish. A flavor of fresh-baked bread and a softer texture develop with time in the glass Pretty red fruit introduces this wine, with hints of rose and cranberry (it’s 40 percent pinot noir, the balance chardonnay). The flavors are bright and juicy, edged with a little baking spice, then ending on gentle notes of tart lemon and white flowers. An elegant start to a dinner party. "
462,Dunn Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,109,13.9,0.0,0,"Dunn's 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon shows terrific purity and focus in its aromas of cassis and pencil shavings and on the medium to full-bodied palate, where it's streamlined and smooth. There's intensity and concentration, but they sort of slide past almost unnoticed, lubricated by fine-grained tannins and lingering notes of cassis and graphite on the finish. The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley) is a gorgeous wine, especially for Dunn fans who want a wine to drink that won't take forever to come around. Dark and savory, with terrific depth, the 2018 is full of character. Black cherry, lavender, chocolate, sage, mint and cloves all open in the glass. The 2018 has just enough grip to have a good amount of classic structure, but not to the point of being forbidding. The Napa Cabernet is about 55% Howell Mountain and 45% Coombsville fruit. The 2018 is beautifully done and an absolute delight. Well-endowed, with waves of lightly warmed plum sauce, blackberry preserves and melted black licorice framed by a roasted apple wood note. Flashes of sassafras and sweet bay leaf add alluring range through the muscular finish. Best from 2023. "
463,Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,149,14.5,4.4,18,"One of the more notable successes in Pessac-Léognan is this 2018 thanks to its wonderful bouquet of red cherry, spring flowers, cedar and liquorice, graphite aromas and elegant earthy notes. With building tannins, a fresh, focused texture, and a great finish, it's not for those looking for instant gratification, and I suspect it will need a solid decade or more of cellaring, but it will evolve for 50 years or more. The 2018 Château Smith Haut Lafitte is based on 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot, and the balance Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, all of which was brought up in 60% new French oak. Its dense purple color is followed by an incredible perfume of blackcurrants, blueberries, camphor, scorched earth, chocolate, and tobacco. It's young and unevolved, yet the purity is off the charts, and it slowly gives up more spice and floral notes with time in the glass. Hitting the palate with full-bodied richness, it's an incredibly concentrated, powerful wine that has plenty of baby fat covering serious amounts of underlying structure and tannins. It has some up-front appeal from an educational standpoint, yet really needs a decade of bottle age and is going to keep for 30-40 years in cold cellars. It comes closest in my mind to a mix of the 2010 and 2016. Purity of fruit here with plum and cherry aromas, as well as wet earth and spice. Light stone. Very floral and vivid. Full-bodied with layers of ripe tannins that are balanced and polished. Savory finish. Incredibly polished and refined. Goes on for minutes. One of the finest Smith-Haut Lafittes I have tasted. Drink after 2024. Ripe and seductive, with a caressing wave of cassis, plum puree and blackberry compote flavors that hold sway throughout, but not without support from enticing savory, licorice, warm loam and mineral accents along the way. Cashmere finish lets everything sail on and on. Gorgeous. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2024 through 2040. "
464,Chateau Sansonnet,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,39,15,4.3,6,"Another beautiful wine from the Lefévère family that does everything right, the 2019 Château Sansonnet has a textbook Saint-Emilion bouquet of chalky minerality, ripe red and black fruits, notes of truffle and flowers, medium to full body, and beautiful overall balance. In the past, this wine has had a glossy, slightly modern style (in a good sense), but the 2019 has an incredibly classic feel with its oak nicely integrated and just a liquid rock-like minerality on the finish. It's a gorgeous wine that will benefit from 2-4 years of bottle age and keep for over two decades. Best After 2024 Ripe blackberries, cherries, praline, walnuts and lavender on the nose. It’s medium-to full-bodied with fine, plush tannins. Creamy and polished. Drink after 2024. This is both lush and structured, with a gush of dark, steeped cassis, blackberry and fig notes leading the way and quickly followed by singed alder and juniper, warm humus and cast iron notes, which really linger. This won't ever be a charmer, but it will develop nicely over time. Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Best from 2023. "
465,Amapola Creek Jos. Belli Vineyards Chardonnay,2017,Chardonnay,California,49,13.9,4.1,8,"A barrel sample, the 2017 Chardonnay Jos. Belli Vineyards has lovely yeasty/toasty scents over a core of white peaches, lemon tart, pineapple and lime leaves with orange blossoms and fresh ginger in the background. Medium to full-bodied, the palate delivers plenty of rich, ripe stone fruit and tropical scents with a pleasantly oily texture and great length. 92-94 points From a site in the Russian River Valley, the 2017 Chardonnay Jos. Belli Vineyards spent 11 months in a mix of new and used French oak. Its light gold color is followed by notes of ripe pineapple, peach, honeysuckle, and white flowers. It's rounded, has a fleshy, medium-bodied mouthfeel, notable balance, and a clean finish. It's rock solid and one pleasure bent, impeccably made Chardonnay to drink over the coming couple of years. "
466,Domaine Huet Haut Lieu Demi-Sec,2020,Chenin Blanc,France,41,0,4.4,24,"This broad, striking white is elegant and rich with complexity, featuring green melon, yellow fig, ginger and verbena notes, underscored with heather, stone, flint and spice details. Offers great energy and tension, showcasing expert craftsmanship. Drink now through 2036. "
467,Gaja Sori San Lorenzo,2009,Nebbiolo,Italy,495,14.5,0.0,0,"Gaja's 2009 Sori San Lorenzo, on the other hand, is much more typical in its expression. Layers of juicy dark cherries, menthol, spices, tar, licorice and graphite flow across the palate as this powerful, masculine wine opens up in the glass. Balsamic infused aromas and flavors develop in the glass, adding considerable complexity and the signature of this great terroir, indisputably one of Piemonte's very finest. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039. There's always something magical about Gaja's Sorì San Lorenzo. It’s the intensity and fullness of the wine that penetrates to the back of the palate and offers many long minutes of persistency on the finish. The bouquet is redolent of black fruit, leather, spice, tar, licorice and dried herb. Subtle and rich with raspberry and blueberry aromas and touches of peaches and lavender too. Full-bodied, with intense lavender and spice character with chocolate and fruit flavors. Long, long finish. A rich, muscular style, with black cherry, plum, smoke and spice aromas and flavors holding court. Balanced and smooth, in a modern style, showing refinement and length on the finish. "

470,Patrick Bottex Bugey Cerdon Rose La,Cueille,Sparkling Rosé,France,22,8,4.4,115,"This is gamay and poulsard grown in limestone, fermented without additions and bottled before it’s finished, as a pétillant naturel. If you haven’t tasted Bugey-Cerdon, it may come as a surprise, with sweet notes of candied rose petals, fresh lingonberries, a little greenness and some pink grapefruit acidity. Asked what she might serve with this wine, Tasting Director Sarah Looper suggested pouring it as an aperitif, “or with Vietnamese food, Thai food or light nut desserts like hazelnut cake or a savory strawberry tart”. "
471,Domaine de Triennes Rose,2021,Rosé,France,20,12.7,4.2,16,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Triennes Rosé is lovely, stylish, and smooth.

472,Chalk Hill Estate Red,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,57,15.5,0.0,0,"A texturally thrilling red. It opens with scents of red cherry, boysenberry, and coffee. Bittersweet dark chocolate has a melting, grainy mouthfeel, with powdered, plum skin tannins taking hold. Dynamic and refined, this blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Malbec, 10% Petit Verdot, and 2% Carménère was aged 21 months in (61% new) French oak. Winemaker Courtney Foley’s talented handiwork results in a well-built engine that purrs to the finish. Ripe loganberry, mulberry and plum notes meld nicely together in this version, which also reveals a hint of licorice snap and a flash of singed alder through the finish. Crowd-pleaser style. Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Carmenère. "
473,Big Basin Dune and Mountain Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,38,12.6,0.0,0,"This 100% whole-cluster blend of the sandy Lester and mountaintop Coastview vineyards is very fresh and vibrant on the nose, with aromas of raspberry juicesoaked herbs, menthol, sansho pepper and wet asphalt. The texture is stunning on the sip, where the minty pine needle flavor weaves between sour cherry and light raspberry elements. "
474,Famille Perrin Cotes du Rhone Villages Rouge,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,15,13.5,3.8,68,"A direct version, with a stream of expressive black cherry and raspberry fruit lined with light licorice and singed alder notes on the finish. Grenache and Syrah. Drink now "
475,Merry Edwards Russian River Pinot Noir,2020,Pinot Noir,California,64,14.5,0.0,0,"Moving into some black fruits with the 2020 Pinot Noir Russian River Valley, it offers notes of dark fresh earth, toast, and cinnamon stick. The texture is full, with fairly gripping structure, and the palate is rich with black cherry, tea leaf, and forested earth. Drink this over the next 10 or more years. Packs some punch, with a dense and juicy core of linzer torte, blackberry and black cherry flavors. Well-defined, with light anise and apple wood accents through the structured finish. A bit unbridled in feel but will certainly have fans. Best from 2023 "
476,Beaulieu Vineyard Rutherford Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,79,14.9,0.0,0,"A very attractive red now, with complexity and yummy drinkability.

485,Antinori Pian delle Vigne Brunello di Montalcino,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,94,14,0.0,0,"A mix of cherry and berry fruit and wild herbs mark this red, whose texture starts out smooth before tannins turn aggressive on the finish. There is a lingering aftertaste of cherry, iron, earth and tobacco. Best from 2024 through 2042. This is a wine to watch, thanks to some exciting new changes to come. The Antinori family purchased new vineyards located at the highest point in the appellation at the romantically named Passo del Lume Spento (Pass of the Extinguished Lantern) where higher altitudes make for cooler growing conditions. This new acquisition complements the estate's current holdings in Pian delle Vigne (translated as the ""flatlands of vines"") located at much warmer lower elevations with heavier reddish soils. That means future vintages (wines to come after the 2018 Brunello that is already in bottle as I write this) may see a blend of fruit from the two sites, giving the winemaking team much more latitude to blend from both cool and warm parcels. Or the Passo del Lume Spento fruit could end up in its own single-vineyard bottling. It will be interesting to see how the estate uses its new fruit and its new winery. Cherry, plum and cedar aromas follow through to a medium to full body with integrated, polished tannins that are fine and pretty. Not the biggest Brunello from this vintage, but shows interest and focus. Try after 2023. "

He takes a detour to Howell Mountain for cabernet franc before returning to Beaulieu’s estate vineyards in Rutherford for petit verdot and malbec. It comes together in a savory wine with delicate flavor complexity and gentle Rutherford grandeur. There’s something a little salty and sweaty in it that brings to mind cilantro, pointing the wine toward carne asada with salsa fresca. This is a blend of all five major Bordeaux red varieties, leading with 78% Cabernet Sauvignon. Licorice, toasted oak and black plum and berry wrap around intense structure and rounded richness, finishing in tobacco and plum. The 2018 Reserve Tapestry Proprietary Red Wine is blended of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot, 5% Malbec and 1% Cabernet Franc. Deep garnet-purple in color, it bursts with open-knit notes of black cherry preserves, warm cassis and redcurrants, plus hints of forest floor, clove oil and Ceylon tea, with a waft of wild sage. The full-bodied palate has a soft texture of ripe, fine-grained tannins and lovely freshness, finishing savory. "
489,Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle No. 17 Les Reserves (1.5 Liter,Magnum),Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,"1,499",12,0.0,0,"This is only in magnums and jeroboams and is stunning, with the sensibility of a red Burgundy, yet fresh and bright, due to the Chardonnay. Wild aromas of brioche, white pepper and rosemary. Maybe even some lavender. Full-bodied, yet always agile and vivid in the mouth. Stunning finish. Minerally and vivid. Only few bottles made. A blend of 1995, 1993, and 1990. Only bottled in magnum and jeroboam with a production of around 3000 bottles, this cuvée was specially released for Laurent Perrier’s bicentenary celebration in 2012. Tasted from magnum and disgorged 18 months ago. The 1995 vintage represents 70% with equal quantity of the other two. This is showing beautiful evolution with exotic notes, brioche with a nutty complexity. While rich on palate with secondary characters coming through, it still has a lovely precision and brightness from the acidity. A very stylish Champagne The NV Brut Grand Siècle Les Réserves Cuvée No. 17 (Magnum) is in a beautiful place where it offers a good deal of flavor complexity and yet remains light on its feet. An exotic mélange of orange confit, petrol, dried flowers, baked apple tart and hazelnut give the No. 17 striking aromatic nuance. Bright floral and citrus notes, along with a hint of reduction, add freshness. It's a terrific choice for readers who enjoy Champagne with a good deal of mature nuances. The No. 17 is a blend of vintages 1995 (60%), 1993 (20%) and 1990 (20%). Disgorged May 27, 2019. "

Full-bodied, yet firm, fresh and bright with a creamy, crunchy finish. One of the best values in Napa appellation designated reds. Drink or hold. Lush, with boysenberry, plum and blackberry compote flavors liberally laced with licorice snap and sweet spice accents. Reveals a glimmer of graphite on the finish to keep it honest. For the hedonist crowd. "
493,Graham's Vintage Port,2016,Port,Portugal,150,20,4.2,27,"Extremely complex aromas that show the classic Graham character of black-fruit marmalade and burnt oranges. Follows through to a full body with great grip at the finish. Lightly sweet. Chewy and powerful. Such a focus at the end. Super-ripe with an expressive plum and dark chocolate aroma. Rich opulence backed by dark chocolate intensity and spicy tannic grip – big and bold on the finish. Voluptuous with fabulous richness, big and bold on the finish. This is one for the long haul but it’s already very impressive. This is lush and captivating in feel, with a velvety flow to the mix of plum, blackberry, boysenberry and açai berry compote flavors. A bold streak of licorice runs through the finish, underscored by a brambly note that imparts
balance. A stunning display of fruit. Best from 2030 through 2050. The 2016 Vintage Port is a blend of 37% Touriga Nacional, 42% Touriga Franca and various others. It comes in with 115 grams of residual sugar. A bit bigger than Dow's this year, this is more intense as well. The better wine of these two benchmarks seems to be this Graham's. Tight on the finish, aromatic and very flavorful, this actually opens rather well and shows off its lovely fruit. The Dow's will be approachable a bit earlier, perhaps, and this may reward aging even more. As always, Graham's is wonderfully delicious. That's one hallmark of the house. I'm not sure this is a truly great Graham's, but at the moment, it is enticing, with plenty of potential for improvement.  "
494,Jean Vesselle Rose de Saignee,Brut,Sparkling Rosé,France,65,12,0.0,0,"This vinous Champagne’s sour-cherry flavors carry the meaty flesh and the crunchy skins of the fruit. It’s distinctly dark, yet acidity keeps it crisp, encouraging the wine’s floral scents. A concentrated 100 percent pinot noir from Bouzy, this could take on a seared New York strip steak. A deep cranberry in color and very vinous in style, this is like red Burgundy with bubbles, offering hints of violet and graphite to the ripe black cherry and plum fruit and spice and dried thyme notes. Vibrant acidity steers this wine through to the lightly chalky finish. Enjoy this with food, perhaps duck with a fruit sauce. Disgorged in April 2021, the latest release of Vesselle's NV Brut Rosé de Saignée is performing well, exhibiting aromas of smoky red berries, plums and orange rind, followed by a medium to full-bodied, fleshy and generous palate that's complemented by a pillowy mousse. It's an attractive gastronomic Champagne, but it's elegant enough to work well unaccompanied too. Best after 2021. COMMENTARY: The Jean Vesselle Rosé de Saignée is generous and packed. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of dried earth and bright red fruits. Pair it with Thai basil chicken. (Tasted: May 9, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "
495,William Fevre Chablis Les Clos Grand Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,199,0,0.0,0,"Fèvre's largest grand cru, with 4ha located higher up in Les Clos, meaning this is cooler climate and with much more chalk than Kimmeridgian. 50% of the vines were planted by William Fèvre's father in the 1940s. Perfect balance between precision, concentration, acidity and ripe fruits, with oak that’s not at all apparent. A fresh, glorious wine. The 2020 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos is another brilliant effort from Fèvre's immensely able winemaker, Didier Seguier, and his team. Unwinding in the glass with aromas of confit citrus, fresh bread, oyster shell, orange zest and crisp orchard fruit, it's full-bodied, satiny and muscular, with a concentrated, tensile profile and a long, intensely saline finish. It's the broadest and most powerful wine in the range, while remaining quintessentially Chablisien. "

497,Chateau Lafite Rothschild,2003,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,459",12.7,0.0,0,"The 2003 Lafite Rothschild comes as close to perfection as any of the great Lafites made over the past three decades (1982, 1986, 1996, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2010). This sensational effort came in at 12.7% natural alcohol, it is made in the style of one of this estate’s great classics, the 1959. Composed of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it exhibits a dense ruby/purple color to the rim along with a luxurious bouquet of cedarwood, lead pencil shaving, white chocolate, cocoa and cassis. Fat, rich, opulent and full-bodied with low acidity and stunning seductiveness and complexity, this noble wine possesses a bountiful, generous, heady style. It is just coming into its plateau of maturity where it should hold for 20-25 years. This is one of the candidates for the wine of the vintage – make no mistake about that. Spicy and rich, with a tobacco and berry character on the nose and palate I love the nose. Full bodied, with soft velvety tannins that give you so much. This goes on and on. Sexy and exciting. This is a splendid wine. Yes, it is more powerful than the usual aristocratic Lafites, but it still manages to retain a special air of great elegance and presence. The fruits are black, the tannins immensely powerful, the flavors are of black figs, dates, cocoa. At the end, there is a vibrant acidity that shows through, which promises a great life for this great wine. Subtle, complex aromas of berries, licorice and currants. Full-bodied, with well-integrated tannins and a long finish. Very well-integrated wine. Lovely stuff. Wonderful length and finesse. "

The wine offers lifted aromas of black and purple fruits with crushed stone or chalk at the back. The acidity is, of course, very present. There is a point of candied cherry sweetness that rides high on the bouquet. This is a solid food wine. Best After 2022 "
500,Jacquart Brut,Mosaique,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,47,12.5,4.3,137,"This is a very successful classic blend. A concatenation of chocolate, liquorice and yellow plum with good biscuit buttressing from reserves. Blend : 40% Chardonnay, 35% Pinot Noir, 25% Pinot Meunier "

Deep garnet-purple in color, it rolls out of the glass with perfumed rose hip tea, fragrant earth and incense scents, giving way to a core of kirsch, blackberry preserves and blackcurrant pastilles plus a touch of iron ore. Full-bodied, rich and seductive, it has exquisitely ripe, finely grained tannins and a refreshing backbone, finishing long and minerally. Lots of ripe, plummy fruit with orange peel, flowers and cherries on the nose. Some stones. It’s full-to medium-bodied with a round, juicy palate and a flavorful finish. Very attractive and well balanced. Drinkable now, but better in 2022 and onwards. This has energy and intensity, with bramble-edged plum, blackberry and boysenberry paste flavors that saturate without being heavy, backed by anise and apple wood on the well-defined finish. A late flash of iron adds the final touch. Sneaky long. Best from 2022 through 2038. "
503,Louis Roederer Brut Nature Philippe Starck Label,2015,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,109,12.5,0.0,0,"This is very minerally and stony, with chalk and salt and oyster-shell undertones. It’s full-bodied and layered, yet remains intense with a lively finish. Done dry. Umami. No dosage. From biodynamically grown grapes with Demeter certification. Field blend from a single plot in Cumieres. Better in a few years. Drink or hold. The 2015 Champagne Starck Brut Nature is forward with vinous and spicy aromas of saline and red currant, orange blossom, and smoke. It is expansive on the palate while maintaining a core of fresh acidity, with peach, dried flowers, and wet stone. This complex and unique expression is full of energy and has great gastronomic appeal. Best after 2022. The most compelling rendition of this bottling that Roederer has produced to date, the 2015 Brut Nature exhibits inviting aromas of golden orchard fruit, clear honey, dried white flowers and wet stones. Medium to full-bodied, layered and vinous, with a fleshy, concentrated core of fruit, chalky structure and a long, precise finish, it's a Pinot Noir-dominant blend from Cumières that's slightly lower in pressure, making for a more delicate mousse. A fresh, mineral-driven Champagne, this swathes a firm frame of acidity in a raw silklike texture and finely meshed flavors of crunchy pear, mandarin orange peel, salted almond, dried raspberry and pickled ginger. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Best from 2023 through 2033. "
504,Marques de Murrieta Rioja Reserva,2017,Tempranillo,Spain,28,14.5,4.3,18,"Beautifully perfumed with dried flowers, walnuts and violets to the dark berries on the nose. Full-bodied, yet very tight and refined with creamy, chewy tannins that are polished and poised. A lively, finely crafted red. Nice to drink now, but shows excellent potential for the future. The red 2017 Rioja Reserva is their flagship wine, of which they produce 900,000 bottles exclusively from grapes from their 300 hectares of estate vineyards. It's a blend of 83% Tempranillo, 9% Graciano, 6% Mazuelo (Cariñena) and 2% Garnacha and has the character of the vintage, ripe and warm but without excess. The varieties fermented separately, even different plots fermented separately, and they also aged in barrel on their own. The blend is done at the end, after 20 months in American oak barrels. 2017 was a challenging year that they still consider a better vintage than 2018, as they see more concentration and power. The wine is quite lactic and creamy, still showing very young. It does feel undeveloped and in need of some time in bottle. The wine has concentration and clout, and I always consider it an ultimate example of an updated classical Reserva from Rioja. 2017 was the earliest harvest (started and finished in September), a warm and dry year when the Ygay estate miraculously escaped the terrible frost that decimated most of Europe. The challenge for this wine was to contain the ripeness and power, and they have done it. This will be released in spring 2021, so it should be a lot more integrated by then. This is always a sure value. Volumes are lower this year. Lightly baked and leathery berry aromas are subtle. This wine is racy and clipping on the palate, with popping acidity. Spiced plum and cherry flavors are backed by oaky vanilla prior to a persistent finish with classic Rioja notes of oak, tomato and bright acidity. "
505,Domaine Raymond Usseglio Chateauneuf-du-Pape Cuvee Imperiale,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,79,14,0.0,0,"Deep, spicy and fragrant, this is a very concentrated and elegant Chateauneuf-du-Pape with remarkably fine tannins and floral delicacy alongside its earthy primacy. Mainly produced from grenache vines planted in 1901 and 1902. From Demeter-certified biodynamically grown grapes. Drink or hold. Saturated magenta. Highly perfumed raspberry and cherry liqueur, exotic spice, incense and potpourri aromas are complicated by hints of musky herbs and smoky minerals. Juicy, seamless and energetic on the palate, offering pliant red berry, cherry cola, allspice and lavender flavors that show superb definition and back-end lift. Polished, even tannins lend grip to a strikingly long, penetrating finish that echoes the floral and mineral notes. These vines were reportedly planted in 1901 and 1902.  "
506,Chateau Leoville Barton,2005,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,199,13,4.0,10,"Power and elegance merge effortlessly in this superb wine. Its pure black currant fruit is tightly coiled, supported by just the right amount of firm tannins. Great aging potential. A triumph. Delivers breathtaking aromas of blackberry, currant, licorice and flowers. Full-bodied, with a solid core of fruit and supersilky tannins. Dark chocolate, currant, berry and licorice follow through. This is racy and beautiful. Best after 2015. This offers aromas of spices, dried dark fruits, meat and berries. Full and muscular on the palate, with strong tannins and a long, long finish. This is very powerful and chewy, but a little bit tight. This is a wine for the cellar. Don’t touch this until 2018. Deep, dense and optimally ripened curranty fruit is teamed with neatly fit oak and hints of dried flowers in the sweet and very involving aromas of this lovely young Saint-Julien, and, while is arguably shows a touch of ""California"" ripeness, it is classically structured with finely fit tannins that will take time to resolve. It should be reaching its stride in five or six years, but it might not show its best face for twice that time. "
507,Chateau Haut-Brion (1.5 Liter Magnum),2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,459",14.6,0.0,0,"The 2018 Haut-Brion is composed of 49.4% Merlot, 38.7% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11.9% Cabernet Franc. Deep garnet-purple in color, the wine needs a lot of swirling before it begins to release a whole complex melody of notes, one at a time to begin: tilled earth, followed by pronounced licorice, then crushed rocks, then the preserved plums. Eventually, it all comes together into a fascinating crescendo of intense crème de cassis, rose oil, wild blueberries and kirsch notes, giving way to quiet, persistent leitmotif scents of cinnamon stick, truffles and redcurrant jelly. The medium to full-bodied palate delivers all this and more, revealing tightly wound black fruit, red berry and exotic spice layers within a solid, wonderfully plush frame and seamless freshness, finishing with epic length and loads of earth and mineral sparks. Aromas of currants, leaves, fresh mushrooms, oyster shell, tobacco, and dried flowers, following through to a full body, yet ever so refined and polished and it grows on the palate. Lovely, energetic finish. Subtle and driven at the end of the palate. Drink in 2026 and onwards. This is powerfully built. Less welcoming than La Mission at this stage but it feels like it is going to pull away increasingly as the decades pass. A serious wine, with layers upon layers of bilberry, blueberry, charcoal, fig, sage and rosemary that peel back over a good half an hour of being poured. Harvested 6 September to 2 October. Drinking Window 2030 - 2052 A quintessential expression of this terroir, the 2018 Château Haut-Brion checks in as 49.4% Merlot, 38.7% Cabernet Sauvignon and the balance Cabernet Franc brought up in a mix of new and used barrels. Ripe and sexy, yet also offering subtle aromas and flavors of blackcurrants, smoked earth, tobacco leaf, truffle, lead pencil, and minerals, it takes its time opening up but reveals a full-bodied, concentrated, multi-layered style carrying gorgeous tannins, flawless balance, and just a wonderful symmetry and elegance paired with beautiful richness. This noble, gorgeous Haut-Brion will benefit from 7-8 years of bottle age and cruise for 40 years or so. Waves of cassis, cherry puree and blackberry paste roll through in this showstopper, with notes of tea, sandalwood, iron and anise providing an entourage for the fruit. A subtle warm earth accent underscores the finish without intruding on the texture. A large-scaled yet eminently refined wine. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2025 through 2045. "
508,Louis Roederer Collection 242 (1.5 Liter,Magnum),Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,129,12,0.0,0,"Aromas of cooked apple, bread dough and lemon tart follow through to a full body with round, delicious fruit and a rich, flavorful finish. Yet, it remains tight and fine with lovely, compressed bubbles. New energy and freshness. Medium-to full-bodied with layers of fruit and vivid intensity. 42% chardonnay, 36% pinot noir and 22% pinot meunier. 8 grams dosage. Four years on the less. A new-format non-vintage that designates the year of the 242nd harvest, 2017, plus reserve wine of 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Drink or hold. For all its freshness and finesse, Roederer’s new multivintage release (see page 64 for the technical details) also exhibits notable warmth and generosity. On the nose, ginger joins baked apple and frangipane tart; the mouth, meanwhile, fills all the way up with sunbathed orchard fruits, plus hints of lime zest and oak spice. The finish, like the perlage, goes on and on. This first release of Roederer’s new Collection is based on the 2017 harvest, the 242nd for the house. This wine replaces Brut Premier. Jean-Bap- tiste Lécaillon bases the Collection blend on a “perpetual reserve,” held in stainless steel since 2012, with wine added in each vintage: half pinot noir, half chardonnay, none of it having undergone malolactic conversion. For the 242 blend, he included some oak- aged reserve wines before selecting individual parcel wines from partner growers, focusing on chardonnay, along with some meunier and pinot noir from the Marne Valley. The final blend is 34 percent perpetual reserve, 10 percent oak-aged reserves, and 56 percent from the 2017 harvest. While Brut Premier was a more spherical wine in the mouth, Collection 242 is finer, with greater length of flavor and more energy. The scent is floral and seashell-mineral, the texture caressing, then tense.  Softly shimmering straw gold, green tints, with a delicate filigree dancing at will around the glass. The nose is gently authoritative; spring flowers garlanding stone fruit, a hint of hawthorn maybe, then lemongrass. The palate has encyclopaedic depth, the intricacies of the Perpetual Reserve weaving their early magic; almond, sloe, gingerbread and apples; the finish has a pleasing twist of bitterness, courtesy of the small percentage of oak-aged reserve wine. Maybe the dosage (8g/L) can come down even further, such is the engaging and subtle complexity harnessed elsewhere? A bright, harmonious Champagne, layering well-cut acidity and a chalky underpinning with flavors of white cherry, crunchy pineapple, green almond and beeswax. The finely detailed mousse carries hints of saffron and spring blossom on the lingering finish. "
509,Marques de Caceres Rioja Reserva,2016,Tempranillo,Spain,25,14,3.8,52,"Aged 15 months in French oak, this blend of 90% Tempranillo and 10% other varieties offers cherry-skin tannins and note of cherry pith and red tea. Red fruit is perfused with radiant notes of cedar, violets, and clove. Clay, limestone, and iron-rich soils show in a stony core surrounded by bittersweet dark chocolate. A labor-intensive beauty, the wine spends 22 months in barrel, with decanting every four to six months, before aging a minimum of two additional years in bottle. A rich red, marked by a mix of black cherry, blackberry, wild herbs and iron. This is mostly about the fruit, with a dense matrix of tannins providing structure. Fine length. Tempranillo, Garnacha Tinta and Graciano. Best from 2024 Aromas of blackberry, dark plum, roasted meat, dried herb, toffee and baking spice. It’s full-bodied with chewy tannins. Concentrated and structured. Excellent balance. Vegan. Drink from 2023. "
510,J. Christopher Dundee Hills Volcanique Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,Oregon,41,13.5,3.8,19,"Distilled from estate lots planted on volcanic soils, this really does smell like volcanic earth, in its smoky and mildly earthy notes. The cool red-fruit flavors seem plush at first but lengthen and become velvety after a day, spicy with hints of rooibos tea, cinnamon and tar. For tea-smoked duck. Lithe and expressive, this red builds structure and tension as it opens to raspberry, orange zest and black tea flavors, finishing with polished tannins. Blending Pommard and Wadenswil clones from the La Colina Vineyard, this is a red fruited wine with a clean, clear focus. Bing cherries are the strength of the palate, with a minerally, dryly tannic finish. "
511,Taylor Fladgate 20 Year Old,Tawny,Port,Portugal,57,20,4.5,313,"Silky smooth and toasty with nuts, spice and firm acidity; elegant and complex; long and perfectly balanced; bright and exquisite. A complex, wood aged wine, this 20-year-old has a perfumed, dry style. Walnut and spice flavors blend together with the spirit and mature acidity. It’s rich, with just the right amount of age. Rich, with a spicy nose, this offers flavors of fig, dried apricot, mango and ginger. Complex and elegant, delivering concentrated creme brulee and tropical fruit notes that linger on the vibrant and buttery finish. Drink now. The NV 20 Year Old Tawny Port was bottled in 2015 and comes in at 111 grams per liter of residual sugar. On first taste, this was simply Taylor: big, concentrated and serious. It was all that and a bag of chips, but over a couple of days it also demonstrated far more elegance. It seemed arguably better balanced than the 10 year old Tawny this issue. Simply filling the mouth on first taste, this shows fine complexity for its age and it does everything else rather brilliantly. Succulent and inviting, it finishes with waves of concentrated flavors. The fruit remains lifted and and it has a bright, transparent feel. It is hard to resist, often seeming like a bit of an overachiever. A linear, delicate yet seamless style, with nutty and spicy aromas leading to dried apricot flavours encircled by tertiary leather notes. Rounded and characterful. Luscious with butterscotch, fig and golden honey flavors, this is a gragrant, jasmine-scented Porto. The finish is a rush of yellow fruit sweetness, soft and nutty, classical in its balance of freshness and age. "
512,Zuccardi Jose Zuccardi Malbec,2016,Malbec,Argentina,46,14,3.8,30,"Explosively fruity aromas and flavors of blackberry, dark cherry and plum tart are creamy and filled with rich savory and cooking spice accents. Powerfully structured, showing dark chocolate and mocha on the finish, with hints of dried mint. Drink now through 2025. The 2016 José Zuccardi was produced with grapes (90% Malbec and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) from Altamira and Gualtallary in the Valle de Uco. This is the continuation of the old Z bottling, but here the wine is aged mostly in 2,500-liter oak vats rather than in smaller barriques. There are herbal notes reminiscent of green tea leaves, spices and berries. The palate is serious and has chalky tannins, as they select grapes from places in the Valle de Uco that have limestone soils. It seems like they have found the way ahead for this wine in 2016; it's fine, precise and elegant. "
513,Sella & Mosca Cannonau di Sardegna Riserva,2019,Grenache,Italy,18,14,4.0,72,"This is really delicious with berries, cherries, crushed stones, slate and dried rosemary. Subtle and flavorful at the same time. Medium tannins that are polished and pretty. Spices at the end. Grenache, as you may know already. Drink or hold. Well-defined berry fruit on the nose, bramble, fresh cherries, plums and herbal notes with hits of clove. Refined tannins. "

TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of yeastiness, dried fruit, and tart apple. Pair it with roast game birds in a savory cream sauce. (Tasted: May 9, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The 2014 Champagne Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs de Bouzy Pur B3 Brut Nature is fragrant and lifted with white flowers, Anjou pear, and unbaked pastry.

516,Grgich Hills Estate Cabernet Sauvignon,2015,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,95,14.6,4.4,75,"A sumptuous wine with abundant blackcurrant, blackberry, cherry, spice and wonderful dried herbs. Ripe tannin and balanced spicy oak. Real potential to develop further. This Cabernet is blended with 6% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc. Fresh tones of brioche and currant meld with crushed rock, pencil and sweet tobacco. Youthful tannins offer a structured frame to this undeniably elegant wine. This shows some of the classic Grgich hallmarks with fresher fruit that runs in the red to black plum spectrum as well as fresh herbs and grass. Medium to full body, grainy tannins and a minerally, dynamic finish. From biodynamically-grown grapes. "

521,Chateau Laroque,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,34,14.5,4.2,19,"I continue to just love this château, which is located in one of the cooler terroirs in the appellation, sitting on pure limestone soils. Director David Suire continues to fine-tune every aspect of the estate and is the driving force behind the incredible quality we're seeing today. The 2019 Château Laroque is as classy as they come, with an incredible level of refinement and elegance. Ripe black cherries, blueberries, violets, white truffle, and cedar pencil all define the aromatics, and it's medium to full-bodied, with incredible tannins, perfect balance, and a great finish. It doesn't quite have the density of, say, Canon or Clos Fourtet, yet it doesn't lose a beat with regard to purity, finesse, and elegance. It's a gorgeous Saint-Emilion that readers will love to have in the cellar. It offers pleasure today yet won't hit the early stages of maturity for another 5-7 years and will have 20-25 years of overall longevity, probably more. Best after 2027. Blackcurrant, cherry and violet aromas follow through to a medium to full body with very well-integrated tannins that give a soft and creamy impression. Long and satisfying already, but needs another three or four years to come together. Try after 2023. A terrific effort from an estate that was long one of Saint-Émilion's sleeping giants, the 2019 Laroque unwinds in the glass with aromas of cherries, licorice, loamy soil, rose petals and sweet tobacco. Medium to full-bodied, ample and layered, it's deep and concentrated, with succulent aids, powdery tannins and a seamless, integrated profile. It's well worth seeking out. Best After 2025 Still a touch reticent but it's all there, from the dark plum and warmed cassis notes to the underpinning of warm loam and sweet tobacco accents. Features fine-grained tannins, with good cut through the finish. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2023. "

Fleshy, flavorful and fresh red with a crisp finish. Drink or hold. This robust, fragrant red introduces itself with spiced plum and violet perfumes. A Grenache-dominant blend augmented by Syrah, Mourvèdre and Carignan, it's packed with ripe, penetrating red-cherry and strawberry flavors that are lifted by a bristling mineral crush. Enjoy through 2024. Dark plum and blackberry puree flavors form the core, with a black licorice note wrapped around them. A dash of sweet toast on the finish adds to the flattering feel.

The pure fruit at the core is a mix of ripe huckleberry, boysenberry and wild blackberry, with dense but polished tannins. Savory notes of dried rosemary and sage, cigar box, dried apricot and sandalwood linger on the epic finish. Drink now through 2045. Opaque, bright-rimmed ruby. Highly pungent, smoke- and mineral-accented aromas of cherry pit, violet candy, cured tobacco, savory herbs, coconut and exotic spices on the kaleidoscopic nose. Shows superb clarity and spicy lift to its spice-laced bitter cherry, cassis, blueberry and floral pastille flavors, which take on black cardamom, menthol and cola nuances as the wine slowly stretches out. Shows superb delineation and spicy thrust on the youthfully tannic finish, which features resonating cherry, blue fruit and floral notes. COMMENTARY: The 2017 Penfolds Bin 95 Grange is fully packed on the palate and offers a lasting finish. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas of bold black fruit and complementary oak nuances. Lay it in the cellar for a decade before serving it with a grilled Porterhouse steak topped with diced shallots. (Tasted: November 16, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Surprisingly approachable, the seamless meld of fresh red fruits, mocha and liquorice makes for an especially friendly and agreeable young Grange. A fabulous bouquet immediately draws you in – a meadow of wild herbs amid an orchard of plums – while the long palate shows impressive drive. Some spiky raw notes stick out at the end, along with assertive oak, showing that this vintage is still growing into its sturdy frame. This starts with a deeply spicy and brooding nose that packs plenty of (100% new) American oak, some smoked vanilla and ripe dark plums and berries. The palate has a youthful, astringent feel with sinewy oak tannin and deep plum and dark-berry flavors, carrying a big frame of fruit extract. Big, round berries strive towards boldness. A blend of Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale. 100% shiraz. Drink over the next two decades. Strongly marked—as always—by its 100% American oak elevage, the 2017 Grange backs up the cedar and vanilla notes with ample blackberry and cassis fruit. Full-bodied, ripe and almost decadently creamy in the mouth, it's loaded with substance, concentrated and rich, yet—in the context of Grange—relatively light and elegant-seeming on the finish. Only the seventh-ever Grange to be exclusively Shiraz, it originates from Barossa Valley (86%) and McLaren Vale (14%); Shiraz from other growing regions in South Australia failed to make the grade this year.

The wine’s flavors of blackcurrant and plum show a pleasant tangy edge, its earthy tannins firmly guiding the fruit tones without overwhelming them. Hints of licorice and graphite emerge with air, and the dark fruit mingles with iodine notes on the long, seamless finish. The Ca' Marcanda 2019 Bolgheri Rosso Magari offers a surprisingly subtle side to the three very powerful grapes that make up the blend. These are Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. The bouquet is generous and full, with an intricate embroidery of lavender flower, garden herb, black fruit, spice and tobacco. You might even detect a hint of black olive. Magari is structured and solid but never heavy, and it offers a good sense of fresh acidity that makes for a lively and bright finish. That more acidic vein is neatly folded into ample fruity sweetness and flavor. This is a firm yet velvety-textured red with blackberry, sage, pine-needle and dried-flower aromas and flavors. It’s medium-to full-bodied with a lovely mouth feel and a long finish. Drink after 2023, when everything will have come more together. Starts out rich, yet underscored by vibrant acidity and a line of refined tannins, which provide the support for this red's black currant, black cherry, wild herb and iron flavors. Finishes lean and firm. Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Best from 2023 through 2030. "

J Vineyards & Winery’s inspired suggestion to serve it alongside seared black cod with caramelized cauliflower and Meyer lemon is, truth be told, one we can’t get out of our heads. Steely and full of snappy acidity, with accents of red apple, gingerbread and lemon tart that build richness and plushness on the lingering finish. Drink now. Broadly defined in honeysuckle, peach, brioche and moderate acidity, this is a crowd-pleasing and immensely likable sparkling wine. The finish lingers on a deep, nutty tone. Nicole Hitchcock, head winemaker at classic Sonoma sparkling house J. Vineyards, crafts over 30 wines annually. The Cuveé 20 is their classic blend of the three Champagne grapes across their six estate vineyards in the Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast.

Super-ripe black cherry, lavender, spice, menthol, licorice and rose petal build in a rich, dramatic wine endowed with superb depth, intensity and pedigree. All the best elements of the house style are on display in this sumptuous, modern Tuscan red. Two thousand sixteen is a terrific vintage for the Concerto. I loved it. A flamboyant and flavorful red with lots of plum and cherry character. Full body, soft tannins and a fruity finish. Lovely, fruity wine with a caressing structure. The 2016 Concerto di Fonterutoli is 80% Sangiovese and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon aged in 225-liter French oak for 18 months. The Cabernet Sauvignon element comes through nicely with dark fruit, spice and some grilled herb. The grape gives the wine a heavier and more concentrated center of gravity. However, the soul and style of the wine is driven by the freshness and delicate aromas of the Sangiovese. "
530,Penfolds Quantum Bin 98 Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,Other,699,14.5,0.0,0,"Muscle and grace delineate a wine that is making history in the footsteps of its forebear, Grange. Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon (87%) and South Australian Shiraz (13%) are the building blocks of this multidimensional creation ten years in the making. Balanced and expressive, with recognizable accents of both the Southern and Northern hemispheres, it offers aromas of fresh dark berries, apple tart, and a touch of piquant spice, which lead to headier notes on the palate. Licorice, slate, and molasses pave a path with staying power. Plum preserves and a twist of basil, cigar leaf, and hazelnut determine the lengthy, exhilarating finish What sticks with you about this global blend of Napa and Southern Australian wine is the intense and transparent purple and blue fruit. Lots of blackberry and blueberry aromas with some stones and flowers, such as violets. It’s a very layered and intense wine with very refined, creamy and chewy tannins. Full and very impressive. Very Penfolds. Mouth-filling texture. It’s made mostly from Napa grapes and predominantly from Oakville and Diamond Mountain. About one-fifth is from South Australia. Aged in 80% new American oak and 20% new French. Try after 2026. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Penfolds Bin 98 Quantum Cabernet Sauvignon is truly a  ""wine of the world."" This wine epitomizes what a wine of the future can be—a production of a Cabernet Sauvignon that belongs to wine lovers. Made from 87% Oakville and Diamond Mountain District AVAs and 13% South Australia, this wine is light years ahead of where we are today. TASTING NOTES: This wine gushes forward with aromas and flavors of black fruit, chalk, and oak. The parts are all there for long-term cellaring. (Tasted: September 24, 2021, Rutherford, CA) A Wine of the World is a big statement, and this blend of 87% Napa Valley Cabernet with South Australian Shiraz creates a purposeful bridge between two national styles. The Cabernet is typically Napa (from the Oakville and Diamond Mountain District AVAs): stern and solid, flexing powerful muscle as earth and iodine notes speak much louder than fruit sweetness. The addition of Shiraz (an elite component, considered for Grange inclusion) isn’t obvious, yet its influence is profound, with a hint of ripe plum adding a vivid burst of color to the dark flavor spectrum. The two varieties strike a happy equilibrium on the mid-palate, wrapping generous layers of rich fruit and supple texture into a seamless weave.  The inaugural release of this red combines 87% Cabernet Sauvignon with 13% Shiraz, using grapes from both Napa Valley and South Australia. Dark and brooding, it delivers a smooth, textured palate of bright red fruit and supple, integrated tannins, with meaty undertones along a continuum of black pepper, graphite and leather. "
531,Penfolds RWT Shiraz,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,169,14.5,0.0,0,"Sourced only from the Barossa Valley, RWT is aged exclusively in French oak, giving it two major points of difference from the rest of the Penfolds range. Always a sexy, voluptuous wine (and admittedly a personal favorite), the 2018 RWT Shiraz ratchets that up to new heights in a great Barossa vintage, boasting layers of berry-like fruit, refined vanilla shadings and baking-spice notes, plus more exotic elements like star anise and cocoa powder. It's full-bodied and plush without being unstructured in any way, with a lingering, complex finish and the concentration to age two decades or more. This wine offers layers of appealing aromas straight off the bat, from black cherry and currant to cedar, mocha, graphite, herbs and black olive. Concentrated yet impeccably balanced, the palate is smudged by savory tannins while spice and dark berry flavors weave seamlessly together. This delivers power and polish. Drink now–2040. This has a very attractively fresh, showy feel to the nose with aromas of ripe red cherries, blackberries, goji berries and redcurrants, as well as red plums and some wild-herb and licorice notes on offer, too. Very expressive and fragrant. The palate has a super intense and powerful delivery of ripe red-cherry and plum flavors and immaculately fresh French oak (64% new) that really clasps and holds the finish long. The tannins are so ripe and well positioned. Drink over two decades. Complex and intense, starting with a core of juicy crushed raspberry, cherry puree and huckleberry flavors, oozing with details of Earl Grey tea, vanilla bean, sandalwood and anise that swirl around on the long, expressive finish, backed by dense, muscular tannins. Powerful, but showing plenty of restraint and promise for the cellar. Drink now through 2045. "

534,Jean-Louis Chave Hermitage Blanc,2019,Rhone White Blends,France,345,0,0.0,0,"Another incredible white from this family is the 2019 Hermitage Blanc, a powerful, concentrated, and remarkably pure Hermitage that has laser-like focus as well as textbook Marsanne notes of quince, green almond, powdered rock, licorice, and spice. It’s still tight, focused, and inward at present, yet it reminds me of the 2018 with its purity and rare mix of power and elegance. It’s worth trying a bottle any time over the coming 3-5 years, but after that, I’d recommend waiting until after 2031. A tasting of barrel samples of different lieux-dits: Les Rocoules, Péléat and Ermite paint a picture of an exceptionally rich and opulent white Hermitage, with great textural generosity and fat, relatively low acidity and fairly high alcohol. The main problem was the speed with which the grapes were taking on sugar at the end of the season, so all the whites were picked in just two days (normally it takes five days), including a Sunday - only the second time they have done this, the previous time due to rot. An atypically large-framed vintage, that will provide plenty of succulent, rich pleasure over the years. Chave's 2019 Hermitage Blanc delivers just the merest hint of toasted grain on the nose, accenting green peaches and waves of honeyed richness. It's full-bodied and concentrated but not overdone, with tremendous length and a hint of bitterness on the finish that left me wondering if this wine will need 20 years to show its best, or if it was still suffering a bit from being bottled in July 2021.

Full-bodied and very powerful with incredible depth of fruit and chewy tannins. It goes on for minutes. Try after 2026. Though well-marked by new oak, there's a vibrant quality to this Barolo, along with cherry, raspberry, iron, tar and tobacco flavors. Supple, almost elegant, with a long, spicy aftertaste, this shows plenty of detail and energy. Opening to a dark color and robust consistency, the Poderi Aldo Conterno 2017 Barolo Bussia Romirasco is perhaps the most powerful of the four new releases reviewed here. Wearing broad shoulders and sporting a heavy gait over the palate, the wine sees a solid construction of dark berry and spicy or toasted oak aromas. There is a lot to behold in this bottle, and it definitely shows the potential to soften and relax with more cellar aging. However, you definitely need to put the bottle aside for many years. "

The palate is wonderfully refreshing, with bubbles that prickle and bounce over the whole tongue right through to the tart red berry finish. Macerated black cherries bathed in a mixture of cloves, cinnamon, thyme and pepper waft out of the glass, inviting you to delve deeper.

541,Domaine des Lambrays Clos Des Lambrays Grand Cru,2019,Pinot Noir,France,599,13.6,0.0,0,"This definitely represents a new beginning for the Clos des Lambrays, beginning with a dizzying array of aromas that range from high-toned red fruits to ripe, plummy black fruit, all touched with spice, and a suggestion of wild herbs and fresh flowers. After blending there was an average of 80% whole cluster fermentation. The texture on the palate is concentrated but not heavy, and there is a charming, silky aspect to it so, despite the tannin and density, the overall impression is one of finesse and elegance. Offers plenty of finesse allied to a firm structure, showcasing rose, cherry, currant, mineral and spice flavors. Vibrant acidity and fine-grained tannins are well-proportioned in this version, while the aftertaste lingers on and on. A picture of elegance, purity and length. Best from 2026 through 2045. The 2019 Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru is showing very well in bottle, wafting from the glass with aromas of raspberries, strawberries and plums mingled with scents of orange rind, rose petals and sweet spices.

It reveals a medium ruby color as well as a beautiful bouquet of black raspberries, dried flowers, incense, and Provençal spice to go with a medium to full-bodied, downright sexy style on the palate. With silky tannins, plenty of mid-palate depth, and a great finish, it’s another 2018 that’s loaded with charm and is going to drink nicely for 10-15 years. Deeper, earthier and spicier than the other bottlings, the 2018 Châteauneuf du Pape A la Gloire de Mon Grand-Père is essentially all old-vine Grenache from the La Gardiole lieu dit. Dustings of cinnamon, allspice and clove accent black cherries and loam on the nose, while the full-bodied palate is rich and velvety, ending long and softly dusty.

A beautiful effort that does everything right, the 2019 Château Grand-Puy Ducasse offers a rich, medium to full-bodied, concentrated style that shows the inherent elegance, as well as richness, of the vintage. Darker currants, toasted spice, cedar pencil, and tobacco notes all define the bouquet, and it's quintessentially Pauillac with its aromatics as well as structure. It already offers pleasure, particularly with a decant (I followed this bottle for multiple days), but it will certainly benefit from 5-7 years in the cellar and is going to shine for at least two decades. Well-packed, showing black currant and blackberry fruit flavors, which are marked by bramble and savory accents and carried by fresh acidity through a finish that's scored by humus, tobacco and iron. A textbook, austere, driven and age-worthy Pauillac. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Best from 2024. The 2019 Grand-Puy-Ducasse exhibits aromas of raspberries, currants and fruit liqueur mingled with subtle hints of loamy soil and pencil shavings. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and demonstrative, with an ample core of fruit, ripe tannins and lively acids and a finish subtly marked by alcoholic warmth, this is more elegant than its muscular, powerful 2018 predecessor; but it's held back by that touch of alcoholic heat. The new ambition that's animating this historically lackluster estate, however, is more than evident, and there are surely great things to come from this address. Best after 2025. "

Coming from incredibly low yields and made from 100% Bien Nacido Chardonnay (from a variety of clones, and the first time this estate has released a 100% Chardonnay), it was aged 19 months in 92% new French oak barrels. It offers a kaleidoscope of aromas and flavors, with notions of ripe orchard and caramelized fruits, lemon curd, fresh baked bread and hints of toast soaring from the glass.

Lohr’s flagship wine year after year, we notice that it continues to grow in terms of mouthfeel, plushness, and strength of character. The 2019 vintage has a je ne sais quoi that’s partly explained by red winemaker Brenden Wood’s blending practices. Prior vintages incorporated Petit Verdot and Malbec, but this one gives voice to Cabernet Sauvignon at 99%. Mocha and sandalwood are a driving force on the broad, dense palate. Blackberry, Worcestershire sauce, and wet earth work in tandem to bring out a savory character and textural depth. "

Full-bodied and very tight with a solid core of chewy yet refined tannins, this is a classically proportioned Barolo that displays superb structure and length. A thoroughly great wine. Try after 2025. Following so quickly after the celestial 2016 vintage, this Gaja 2017 Barolo Sperss shows muscle and brawn; however, the Conteisa holds its own in terms of aromatic complexity. With fruit from Serralunga d'Alba, that added concentration and determination are expected, especially in a hot and dry vintage such as 2017. Here you get dark cherry fruit with cassis and wild plum. There are also floral aromas that veer toward red rose more than they do violets or blue flowers. And, of course, you get some of those iron-rich or mineral notes of rusty nail or iron that are often associated with Sperss. In 2017, according to Rossana Gaja, Sperss was picked almost a month after the start of the harvest on 18 September. Coming from Serralunga, this interpretation of Barolo exhibits a dark profile of earthy tones and chocolate, with graceful jam-like cherry, orange peel and violet. Thick and extracted on the mid-palate with crisp acidity, the structure is perfectly woven into its restrained plummy fruits and liquorice finish. It's not showing much poise at present, but clearly has a long life ahead. Drinking Window 2021 - 2040. A fluid style, this red displays cherry, raspberry, currant, earth and tobacco flavors. Iron and tar accents join in as the dense swath of tannins adds closure. Overall, this is light on its feet, intense and lively, hanging together nicely. "

553,Blackbird Vineyards Arise Napa Valley Proprietary Red,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,58,14.6,4.2,10,"The 2018 Arise, the entry-level wine from Blackbird, is absolutely delicious. Crushed red/purplish berry fruit, mint, sage, licorice and mocha race out of the glass. Medium in body and beautifully perfumed, Arise is a terrific introduction to this lineup. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Blackbird Vineyards Arise is a full-bodied, well-packed red wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine displays aromas and flavors of black fruit and oak. Enjoy its richness with a thick, rare slice of prime rib. (Tasted: August 14, 2021, San Francisco, CA) The 2018 Arise Proprietary Red checks in as a blend of 37% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 26% Cabernet Franc, and the rest Syrah and Petit Verdot. Functioning as an entry level wine from this estate, it has impressive purity in its dark fruits, truffle, chocolate, and herbal aromas and flavors. Medium to full-bodied, nicely textured, and undeniably satisfying, I'd be happy to drink a glass any time over the coming 8-10 years or so. Best After 2021 "

It’s full-bodied with firm, tightly wound tannins. Focused. Excellent tannin framing. Best yet. 65% cabernet sauvignon, 25% merlot, 5% cabernet franc and 5% petit verdot. The 2019 Château Carbonnieux sports a deep purple/ruby hue to go with a brilliant nose of red and black currants, spring flowers, spicy oak, and hints of tobacco. It's beautiful on the palate as well and is medium to full-bodied, has a seamless, elegant texture, ripe tannins, and a great finish. It's the finest wine I've tasted from this estate. The blend is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, and the balance Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, all brought up in 40% new barrels. It’s well worth tracking down some bottles and will keep for two decades. Best after 2022. Dominated by structured Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is powerful, with layers of woodaging flavors to go with the strong tannins.Developing slowly, it is likely to be ready from 2026. Exhibiting aromas of earthy black fruits, bay leaf, burning embers and forest floor, the 2019 Carbonnieux is medium to full-bodied, rich and enveloping, with a broad attack that segues into a fleshy core of fruit framed by ripe acids and fine, powdery tannins that assert themselves gently on the finish. Best after 2025. COMMENTARY: Chateau Carbonnieux is one of the great estates in the Pessac-Legonan appellation, and it has always made sound wines. The 2019 vintage is well built on point. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits aromas and flavors of black fruit and mineral notes. Its tightly-built palate makes it perfect with lightly-seasoned lamb stew. (Tasted: June 29, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Solid, with red currant and cherry paste notes allied to a tarry spine, with tobacco and iron accents on the finish.

The plate is concentrated without weight and has a rounded and balanced mousse, with ripe berries, raspberry liqueur, and a chalky mineral texture with fine grained structure. It has an elegance within its structure that is quite compelling. A fantastic gastronomic wine, to carry through an entire meal or have on its own. Best after 2022. Disgorged in April 2020 with four grams per liter dosage, the latest release of Rodez' NV Brut Blanc de Noirs is already quite expressive, offering up aromas of mirabelle plum, raspberries, toasted almonds, honeycomb and white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and gourmand, with ripe but racy acids and an enveloping core of fruit that's complemented by a pillowy mousse, it's extroverted but precise. What's more, it will be even better with a year or two on cork. "
560,Jansz Premium,Cuvee,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Australia,32,12,4.1,113,"The latest nonvintage from Australia’s most famous Tasmanian sparkling producer is a tasty drop at a bargain price. A blend of Champagne’s three classic varieties, this bottling combines fruit from the north and south of the island. Eighteen months on lees results in a bubbly that is mostly fruit driven—lemon, apple and pear—with the yeast-derived brioche notes serving as a backdrop. Crisp and linear, with lime, grapefruit and green apple flavors that are intense and refreshing. Shows plenty of focus on the finish. A fresh nose with apples, fresh citrus and preserved lemons. Medium-bodied with some nice green and citrus fruit, steely acidity and a bright finish. "

TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits authentic aromas and flavors of earth, savory spices, and ripe apple. Pair it with linguine and clams. (Tasted: April 20, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Disgorged with two grams per liter dosage, Billecart-Salmon's 2009 Extra Brut Vintage is more giving and demonstrative than its 2008 counterpart, offering up inviting aromas of crisp stone fruit, yellow apple, brioche, honeycomb and warm pastry. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, with a pillowy mousse and a generous core of fruit girdled by bright acids, it's seamless and complete. Indeed, such is its charm and persistence that I tend to prefer it, at least for now, to the 2008. A majority of red grapes (40 percent pinot noir and 27 percent meunier) from a majority of grands crus (73 percent) make up this pan-regional blend. Vinified in stainless steel, it has main- tained freshness over the course of long aging on the lees, presenting brisk, cool flavors of lime zest, star fruit and pear. That fruit complexity lasts, while the textural pleasure brings you back for another sip. This is a big, rich wine with lots of strawberry and red-apple character. It’s full and layered with very pretty fruit. Caressing and fresh at the same time. A bit ponderous. 40% pinot noir, 27% pinot meunier and the rest chardonnay. First time with pinot meunier in the blend, helping to maintain balance in the hot 2009 vintage. Drink or hold. "
562,Chateau Ausone,2002,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,627,13.5,0.0,0,"In many respects, the 2002 may be even more impressive than the 2003. A far more challenging vintage to get everything right, and especially in St.-Emilion, where many disappointments have been produced, this is one of the wines of the vintage and (along with Pavie) among the finest wines from the Right Bank. It possesses a deep purple color as well as a gorgeous nose of creme de cassis, blackberries, wet stones, and wonderfully perfumed floral notes. When the wine hits the palate, it exhibits impressive purity, medium to full body, a multi-layered texture, and extraordinary precision and intensity with a finish just short of 50 seconds. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2035. Beautiful blackberry and decadent aromas of meat and earth. Full-bodied, with velvety tannins and a rich, long finish. Should develop really nicely in the bottle.

Long, crystalline finish. Classy Barolo, showing all the complexity of this top vineyard in La Morra. Best from 2024. An expression of dark fruit—black cherry and blackberry—along with black pepper, this red is compelling for its richness and open texture. The tannins are there, emerging as this plays out on the licorice-tinged aftertaste. "
564,Fess Parker The Big Easy,2019,Rhone Red Blends,California,37,14.9,3.9,7,"This Syrah-driven blend starts with smoked meat, dark fruit and pepper dust aromas on the nose. There’s an impressively chalky edge to the palate, which is much more interesting than the nose, offering blackberry paste, smoked beef rib, dried thyme, cracked pepper and a caramel finish. The 2019 The Big Easy is made in a forward, delicious, ready-to-go style and brings tons of ripe dark fruits, peppery herbs, and some candied violet notes to go with a medium to full-bodied, pure, balanced style. As with many of the 2019s here, it shows the fresher, more elegant style of the vintage beautifully, and is probably one of the top vintages of this cuvée. "
565,Bosquet des Papes Chateauneuf-du-Pape Tradition,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,55,0,4.4,7,"This offers a core of warm plum sauce and cherry compote notes laced liberally with singed sandalwood, red tea and tobacco leaf flavors. Accents of perfumed fruit, singed chestnut and shiso leaf mark the old-school finish, with a lightly dusty structure. The classic 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape checks in as 75% Grenache and 11% each of Syrah and Mourvèdre, with the balance a mix of other permitted varieties. Beautiful blackberry and raspberry fruits as well as spice, Provençal garrigue, and ground pepper emerge from this beauty, and it's a medium-bodied, character-filled, spicy, complex red to enjoy over the coming 10-12 years or so. More concentrated and slightly darker-fruited than the 2020, the 2019 Châteauneuf du Pape Cuvée Tradition boasts scents of clove and allspice alongside ripe cherries. It's full-bodied and richly tannic but also mouthwatering and long. It's a sturdy CdP that can be drunk young with grilled beef or lamb or aged and then paired with rich braises and stews. Best after 2023 Fresh and precise berry fruits on the nose, no overripe character. A juicy, harmonious, exuberant style, it has good structure to match the fruit and decent length too. "

569,Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion Blanc,2019,Bordeaux White Blends,France,619,0,0.0,0,"Much more Semillon-based compared to its stablemate, the Haut-Brion Blanc, the 2019 Château La Mission Haut-Brion Blanc is 70% Semillon and 30% Sauvignon Blanc. It's a much more subdued, classic Semillon, offering ripe peach, honeyed lime, sappy herbs, and chalky mineral nuances that show even more on the palate. Rich, layered, and medium to full-bodied, it's another blockbuster of a white from this estate that has everything you could want from a Bordeaux Blanc. It opens up beautifully with time in the glass, is flawlessly balanced, and just a thrill a second. It should evolve for 20-30 years as well. Best after 2022. The 2019 Haut-Brion Blanc is richer and rounder than its stablemate across the street, bursting with aromas of peaches, citrus zest, ripe orchard fruit, pastry cream and white flowers. Full-bodied, broad and textural, it's ample and enveloping, with a demonstrative core of fruit, lively acids and a long, saline finish. Best after 2021. Extroverted, with an energetic display of white peach, Key lime, verbena, oyster shell and quinine notes that are well-defined as they extend through a lengthy finish. Features real tension and drive too, which most whites in this vintage lack. Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. "
570,Mas de Boislauzon Chateauneuf-du-Pape Cuvee Tintot,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,135,0,0.0,0,"The Mourvèdre-dominated (there's 15% Grenache) 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape Cuvée Tintot reveals a dense purple hue as well as a gorgeous bouquet of blackberries, blueberries, cured meats, toasted spice, and peppery garrigue. Deep, full-bodied, and concentrated, it has a flawless mid-palate, ripe, building tannins, and a great, great finish. Aged 90% in concrete tanks and 10% in very old barrels, it ranks with the finest examples of Mourvèdre in the appellation and would easily stand beside Beaucastel’s famed Hommage a Jacques Perrin! Bravo! Very dark in the glass, this is soft and flowing with an earthy fragrance. Packed full of flavour and pliable, gentle tannin. The only minor stumble is the warming alcohol on the finish, but this is a big, driving, humming expression of Mourvedre, with great depth and length. The estate's Mourvedre cuvee, grown on galets roules and sand in lieux-dits Boislauzon and Palestor, fermented in concrete then aged in concrete and old barriques. "

Full-bodied, layered and vinous, it's rich and enveloping, its textural attack segueing into an ample, fleshy core that's girdled by bright acids and enlivened by a pillowy mousse. Long and expansive, it's more generous and gourmand than its racier 2014 predecessor, but just as good. COMMENTARY: The 2015 Champagne Louis Roederer Champagne Rosé shows excellent style and complexity, with a nice bite in the aftertaste. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of fragrant strawberries, a touch of yeastiness, and a faint chalky note. Pair it with grilled, wild-caught salmon. (Tasted: August 2, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Pure and pretty notes of wild strawberry and nectarine fruit are enriched by hints of marzipan, chalk and pickled ginger in this graceful rosé Champagne.

573,Tenuta Guado al Tasso,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,Italy,159,0,4.7,9,"Renzo Cotarella, managing director of Marchesi Antinori tells me that the 2018 vintage showed very different results in the inland and hilly Chianti Classico appellation compared to the flat, sea-facing Bolgheri appellation. This season saw some rain right before harvest. That extra humidity rolled right off the Chianti Classico hills and disappeared without effect, but it stuck around longer in the thicker, flatter soils of Guado al Tasso. For this reason, one of the estate's top wines, the Cabernet Franc-based Matarocchio, was not produced in 2018 for fear that the fruit would not offer the concentration required of a wine of that important stature. The best of that fruit was used in this wine instead. For that reason, the 2018 Bolgheri Superiore Guado al Tasso sees a little more Cabernet Franc (clocking in at about 22% of the blend) and less Merlot, with the rest being Cabernet Sauvignon, of course, (at about 60%). Lots of redcurrants and flowers on the nose, together with crushed stones. Full-bodied and very layered with beautiful fruit and density, yet it remains agile and light. The tannins are totally integrated. I like the light herbal touch to the red fruit here. Flower petals. Juicy, flavorful finish with citrus zest at the end. 60% Cabernet sauvignon, 22% cabernet franc and 18% merlot. Really pretty now, but wait two or three years. Rain showers early in the growing season replenished the water reserves at Guado al Tasso, leading to a plush and rich wine freshened by accents of cool herbs and violets. Its black plum and dark chocolate flavors are ripe and opulent, layered with notes of licorice and espresso, couched in a smooth, creamy texture. There’s plenty of vibrant acidity to keep those flavors lively in the coming years, as the rich oak tones integrate. Made with 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 18% Merlot, this has aromas of cassis, French oak, leather and a whiff of bell pepper that waft out of the glass. Elegantly structured, the bright, linear palate offers black-skinned berries, licorice and coffee bean set against taut, fine-grained tannins. Rich, intense fruit flavors of black currant and black cherry are shaded by vanilla, toasty oak, iron, black olive and tobacco accents in this complex, harmonious red. Fine balance and a lingering finish cap it off. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2023 through 2035. "

Full-bodied with a solid center palate of juicy fruit and powerful, fine tannins. It’s racy and very long. Needs time to soften. Better after 2023. A classy, elegant wine packed full of dried fruits, dates, fragrant wild berries, warm spice, and mocha with firm yet chewy tannins. Needs time. The 2017 Barolo Cannubi is pliant and delicate, with subtle and interwoven aromas of wild rose, redcurrant, grilled herb, crushed stone and smoky licorice. In characteristic Cannubi fashion, the wine appears quite delicate and almost understated in terms of aromas, but then it fleshes out and brings in a whole new dimension with ample power and consistency once it hits the palate. The Damilano family has done a good job in a difficult vintage. Intense aromas of leather, spice, tamarind, tobacco, tar and menthol mingle with cherry in this complex, expressive red. Broad and also fresh and focused, with excellent length to the savory, spicy finish. Aromas of camphor, underbrush, crushed herb and iris come together in the glass. The brawny, concentrated palate shows the heat of the vintage, offering cherry marinated in spirits, prune, licorice and baking spice framed in assertive, close-grained tannins that grip the finish. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol on the close. "
576,Felsina Chianti Classico Riserva Rancia,2018,Sangiovese,Italy,61,13.5,4.4,8,"The 2018 Chianti Classico Riserva Rancia is an absolutely stunning wine. The archetype of Rancia in the past has been of a big, potent Chianti Classico but in 2018, Rancia is a wine of mind-blowing elegance and finesse. Silky, perfumed and indescribably finessed, the 2018 dazzles from start to finish. It's a magical wine in every way. The 2018 is an unusual vintage that shows an especially austere character. Off the bat, it must be said that the Fèlsina 2018 Chianti Classico Riserva Rancia would certainly benefit from more cellar time and a long drinking window. The Rancia is elegant and streamlined with a medium-bodied style that breaks from some of the more concentrated vintages we've seen in the past. The bouquet reveals a lot of dark or black character with blackcurrant, tar, resin, iron ore and a dusty hint of dry graham cracker (which reminds us of the vintage heat). Structurally, the wine offers a solid and firm footing, but it would benefit from further evolution. This is really subtle and complex with cherry, herb, floral and sage aromas that follow through to a full body with firm, fine tannins that give form and energy to the wine. Racy and very fine. Drink or hold. Aromas of French oak come to the forefront along with dark spice and botanical herbs. Mirroring the nose, the taut, linear palate features coconut, espresso and sage alongside dried cherry and orange zest. Tightly wound, close-grained tannins provide the backbone. Drink after 2024. "

Shows subtle savory and cedar hints that stay in the background, as the iron note pierces through the fruit on the finish. Almost approachable for the fruit, but wait if you can. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. "
578,Dominus Estate (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,699,0,0.0,0,"Lots of crushed stone, lead pencil and licorice aromas that are extremely aromatic and bright. Black cherries, cloves and purple fruit, too. Full body and a round and ripe center-palate with a juicy interior. It opens at the end with a savory and juicy finish. Layered and beautiful. Drinkable now, but better in three or four years. The 2019 Dominus is blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon, 6% Petit Verdot and 4% Cabernet Franc, aged in 40% new French oak. Impressively dark-hued in the glass, it yields scents of cherries and cassis on the nose—or is it black cherries and redcurrants? Subtle notes of mocha, pencil shavings and almost Graves-like earthiness wind through the concentrated, medium to full-bodied palate, giving it a sense of savory gravitas, while the finish is silky and long, leaving a lingering residue of soft tannins and mouthwatering freshness. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Dominus Estate is bold, firm, and persistent. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas of black fruit and earthy notes. Give it time in the cellar before enjoying a grilled, aged beef steak topped with a well-ripened blue cheese. (Tasted: May 9, 2022, San Francisco, CA) A loaded wine, though reserved in style, with waves of dense cassis, plum reduction and blackberry preserves moving through authoritatively, while sweet bay leaf, warm loam and tobacco accents fill in the background. The long cast iron spine is deeply buried in the fruit, and this has superior cut and drive. Built for serious cellaring, too. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2024 "

Teeters on the edge of decadence, but has enough vitality to stay on the right side of that line. Plenty of textural complexity on the palate and a long, chalky finish that keeps giving and giving. Spot-on balance. Drink or hold. While showing more fruit girth than most Champagnes, this also has the austere mineral acidity to sculpt it into fine proportion and fantastic, weightless length. Its pinot flavors come through in floral apricot and juicy peach, both powerful and harmonious. For Nantucket Bay scallops or belly tuna sashimi. "

584,Yjar,2017,Other Red Blends,Spain,109,14.5,0.0,0,"Very ripe red with plums, figs, dark chocolate, walnuts and cloves. Full-bodied with round and layered tannins that show ripeness and intensity. Fruit-forward, but formed and powerful. Plush and high-toned. Savory finish. From 3.8 hectares of vineyards. It’s a field blend of tempranillo, graciano, garnacha, granegro and rojal. Shows the ripeness of the vintage with structure and freshness. Crazy wine. Outstanding first bottling of this wine, with global distribution only through negociations in Bordeaux. Better after 2025. The new top-of-the-range is the 2017 Yjar, a difficult name in most languages, selected because the property used to be managed by the Duque de Híjar—this is just a different spelling. It's a red produced with Tempranillo and a significant amount of Garnacha grapes from selected soils from Remelluri. It's a wine that transcends the vintage, with spicy notes, a complex and changing nose, really harmonious, serious, with super sleek tannins, seamless with a polished mouthfeel with a chalky finish. This is a separate project and with a different style from Remelluri (closer, perhaps, to the style of the personal wines from Telmo Rodríguez. It's a wine that will be sold through the Place de Bordeaux, the result of their understanding of the soils from the property, something they knew empirically but for which they now have a more scientific explanation. It feels younger and less developed than the classical wines from Remelluri. It matured mostly in foudre, and there is no trace of oak; the wine feels very young, clean and modern. It's a great effort for a challenging year. It should develop nicely in bottle. 7,000 bottles produced. "

That sweet fruit finishes clean, with a gentle sweep of acidity, balanced and long. For scallop sashimi. 56% Pinot Noir; 44% Chardonnay. Another in a long string of Brut Rosé successes from Roederer Estate, the winery’s latest is a rich and insistently foamy effort that displays subtle highlights of minerals and a nice bit of creamy complexity born of its time on the yeast. Its central and sustained message, however, is that of lightly juicy, cherry-like fruit, and, while fruity, it is wholly free of candied confection. A most enjoyable sipper on its own, it has the depth and the balance to match up famously with lighter salmon recipes or the sweet, first-of-the-season, local Dungeness crab just now coming to market.

Full body, ultra-fine tannins, a gorgeous core of ripe fruit and blackcurrants and blueberries. Racy and very long. So impressive. This needs four or five years to come around but already so fine. Dating back to 1661, Rauzan-Segla had under-performed for many years prior to its purchase in 1994 by Chanel owners, the Wertheimer family. With significant investment, the estate has regained its former glory. Highly successful in 2015, this is refined, elegant and precise with a bright red/black fruit character and lovely freshness on the palate. It will benefit from a few more years in bottle but undoubtedly has star-quality. This takes a very fresh approach, with a seemingly open-knit feel to the mix of mulled raspberry and red currant fruit. Pretty lilac, incense and singed apple wood notes underscore the fruit, while silky but persistent tannins carry the finish. Delivers latent depth and precise balance, so don’t let this early charm fool you, as this should unfurl beautifully in the cellar. Best from 2022 through 2040. "

624,Penfolds Bin 311 Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,Australia,39,13,3.6,25,"This is a blend of three regions, Tasmania, Tumbarumba and Adelaide Hills. It’s Tasmania that really powers this wine in 2019. Opens on a chalky and stony edge with intense, vibrant white-peach and citrus aromas. The palate has a resolved, complete and smooth-honed texture. Flavors of ripe peaches, honey and citrus sit amid fresh, crisp acidity and a long, attractively pithy grapefruit and peach finish. This is a likable, multi-regional Chardonnay blend that is at first tightly reined and straightforward in nature, but reveals more layers as it opens in the glass. It weaves stone fruit, pineapple, salted nuts and toasty characters into a slippery, creamy mouthfeel. The oak is present but not overwhelming and an appealing salted peach note lingers on the finish. It's a solid example of modern Aussie Chardonnay. Sourced from Tasmania, Adelaide Hills and Tumbarumba, Penfolds is seeking to position the 2019 Bin 311 Chardonnay as something of a ""Junior Yattarna."" I guess that's one way to characterize the stuff that doesn't make the cut for the flagship Chardonnay. In truth, this is a fine wine in its own right, boasting struck-match complexity on the nose alongside hints of apple, white peach and lime. Barrel fermented and matured in 35% new French oak, it's medium-bodied and silky textured, but it hides the oak well, ending in a lingering wash of citrus. Fresh and citrusy up front, with lemon zest, tangerine and pomelo flavors that are clear and bright, on a juicy frame. Balanced, with notes of toasted hazelnut and spice on the finish, which gain momentum.  Deceptively delicate, even though it has been framed within a quite sturdy oak outline. The body of the wine is quite fragile – a fine porcelain vase. A whiff of toasty oak rides ahead of very gentle peach blossom. The sliver of lemon has surprising persistence, revealing some pleasing roasted cashew and mineral bite before a squeeze of tart grapefruit providing pucker at the finish. It’s all very prim and elegant, straight-backed and on its best behaviour, but one wonders whether it can loosen up with age. "

Continuum's 2019 Proprietary Red is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Cabernet Franc, 7% Petit Verdot and 6% Merlot, all from the estate vineyard on Pritchard Hill. Aged in two-thirds new French oak, with the balance in second or third-use barrels and a single concrete amphora, it's remarkably dark in hue, a deep, saturated purple in the glass. On the nose, it's floral and herbal yet fruit-driven, with violets, sage and bay leaf adding nuance to black cherries, while the palate is full-bodied, plush and silky. There's an enticing yin-yang to the interplay between high-toned herbals and bass notes of dark chocolate in this dense, concentrated effort that finishes lush and long. It's a magnificent wine that should drink well for at least two decades. From the mighty estate site on Pritchard Hill, this robustly muscular wine consists of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Cabernet Franc (the highest amount ever), 7% Petit Verdot and 6% Merlot. Herbal, it shows notes of violet, graphite and tobacco alongside layers of rich red and black currant. The tannins are substantial and grippy, not quite ready to play nice on the palate.

As with everything from this estate, it's impeccably made and high-quality. This complex wine is thick in tannin and structure, with nuanced underlying elegance.

It will be a candidate for perfection in 10-12 years and is going to be one of the longest-lived wines in the vintage. Hats off to Philippe Dhalluim and his team for this incredible effort that’s a step up over just about every other northern Médoc out there! The 2015 Mouton Rothschild is a blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc aged in 100% new oak with a mid-July 2017 bottling. Deep garnet-purple colored, this Mouton pulls off an incredibly impactful entrance, emerging from the glass with profound notes of blackberry preserves, plum pudding, crème de cassis and grilled meats, featuring perfectly accessorized accents of sandalwood, cinnamon stick and fenugreek with wafts of dried roses, unsmoked cigars and tilled soil. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is completely packed with rich, ripe black fruits sparked with blue and red fruit undertones and an incredible structure of very firm, very ripe tannins, with seamless freshness and an epically long, earth-laced finish. Possessing striking natural beauty framed by impeccable crafting, this 2015 is a total diva and well worth attention. Give it a good 7-8 years in bottle, at least, and drink it over the next 30+ years. Offers a prodigious core of steeped fig, black currant and blackberry compote flavors, enmeshed with notes of smoldering tobacco, charcoal and licorice. Broad, deep and long, with a deep foundation of graphite through the finish. Despite the heft, this manages to show off some purity too. Best from 2025 through 2045. "
629,Gaja Costa Russi,2008,Nebbiolo,Italy,440,14.5,0.0,0,"he 2008 Costa Russi is absolutely gorgeous. Sweet dark cherries, tar, licorice and new leather are some of the aromas and flavors that take shape in the glass. The 2008 is a firm Costa Russi, with less of the seductiveness of most years, but equally fine balance. Ideally it needs a few more years in bottle, but it is striking. The finish shows terrific intensity. The typical juiciness of the site is framed by the firm tannins of the year. Everything that makes Costa Russi such an engaging wine is here, but in a slightly smaller-scaled package than in the very finest years. Blackberries and flowers on the nose follow through to a full body, with chewy tannins and a round texture. All in finesse and length.

Smooth and savory, the linear, elegant palate delivers juicy cranberry, pomegranate, coffee bean and orange zest alongside taut but extremely refined tannins. Surprisingly fresh acidity for the hot vintage keeps it balanced. "
665,Ferrari Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,Italy,38,12.5,4.3,71,"A cornucopia of red-berry aromas pours from the glass of this effusive and delightful rosé and the balance of fruit, crisp acidity and a touch of creaminess from yeast contact makes this an easy sparkling wine to enjoy. So much fruit at the finish, it’s hard to resist! Drink now. Pale salmon color; elegant nose; smooth and juicy with bright acidity and racy style; long and balanced. 60% Pinot Noir; 40% Chardonnay.

This is another classic sparkling wine happily enjoyed in households and at restaurants (before COVID-19) across Italy. The Lunelli family has created an accessible and cheerful wine for the best of times (that we can't wait to get back to). The Ferrari NV Trento Metodo Classico Rosé Brut shows a bright raspberry pink color with faint copper highlights. Wild cherry, peach and cassis characterize the bouquet and cede to light touches of toasted almond and baked bread. To the palate, this sparkler shows a lean, steely approach that is terrific for any festive occasion. "

There is not a ton of subtlety here, but I am not sure that matters all that much given how immensely pleasing the 2016 is. Crushed rocks, graphite, lavender, blackberry, plum, and violet infuse a Saint-Émilion that offers tremendous textural richness as well as vibrancy. Most importantly of all, the 2016 is flat-out delicious. This is a decidedly opulent, dark Saint-Émilion with all of the elements impeccably balanced. I loved it. This shows such complex and beautiful aromas of flowers, lavender, light spearmint and currants. Medium to full body, very fine tannins and a long finish. All about finesse and length. Drink after 2022. A very fresh, juicy style, with pretty floral hints framing a core of cherry, pomegranate and red currant fruit flavors that meld into one another while light anise and rooibos tea accents fill in on the finish. A mineral note knits it all up nicely. Best from 2021 through 2033. "

672,J Vineyards Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,California,44,12.5,4.3,68,"With an inviting, fruity nose, this is a crowd-pleasing, well-made and memorable sparkler with good acidity and lasting freshness. Flavors of tangerine, strawberry and raspberry rise to the fore of the palate, elegantly wrapped around textured elegance. Finding a place at the lighter end of the Rosé spectrum and, in fact, a wine that could easily pass for a Blanc de Noirs, this lightly yeasty version fixes on energetic, slightly juicy, young fruit as its main motif. It is briskly balanced, but its ample acidity enlivens without ever once seeming sharp, and it is wholly free of the astringency that marks its more vinous mates. An impressive array of citrus, apple, savoury mushroom, delicate berries, complex dough and toasted nuts. Beautifully long finish with a lovely fine mousse. A bit reductive on the nose, but with some air you get aromas of baked pear, red cherry and rosemary. Medium-bodied and slightly salty. Strawberry and white tea on the creamy palate.Drink now Blended of about two-thirds Pinot Noir and one-third Chardonnay with a splash of Pinot Meurnier, the NV Brut Rose sports a very pale salmon-pink color, delivering notes of wild strawberries, McIntosh apples and raspberry leaves with a hint of chalk dust.

677,Le Ragnaie Passo del Lume Spento Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,180,13.5,0.0,0,"Prior to regulation changes in 2016, 600 metres was the upper limit for Brunello di Montalcino. From a single vineyard which sits on a sandstone plateau at 621 metres above sea level, this first release of Passo del Lume Spento is particularly significant, not just for Le Ragnaie but for the entire region especially as it corresponds with the blistering 2017 vintage. A harbinger of the future? It exhibits fresh aromas of lavender and fennel with warm, fragrant earth and a subtle smokiness. A mid-weight, crunchy, sinewy wine, it tastes of red berries squeezed from rocky earth, accompanied by tangy acidity. Cherry, strawberry, floral and juniper flavors are quickly encased in a cloak of dense, lively tannins in this red. Though solid and gripping, the lasting impression is not overly astringent. Has length too. Best from 2025 "
678,Louis Martini Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,43,15,4.1,43,"A slightly high-toned red with walnut, berry, chocolate and spice on the nose and palate.

683,Sandeman 20 Year Old,Tawny,Port,Portugal,65,20,4.6,77,"Sandeman’s long-standing reputation for aged tawny Port is confirmed by this wine. It is poised between fresh fruit and spice, dried dates and a generous golden glow. The wine is at its peak and ready to drink. Beguiling exercise in delicacy. Pale tawny colour. Light and fruity aromas. Elegant delivery of fruit weight and sugar. Savoury, dry finish. Broad, rich and elegant, with creamy, supple flavors of butterscotch, toasted coconut and hazelnut. The luscious finish is loaded with spice and cocoa details. Seductive. As a young Port wine drinker, I grew up on Sandeman’s 20 Year Tawny, a wine that always over delivered when it came to gingery energy and shimmering fruit. And though the brand has changed hands, now part of Sogrape, the wine still holds its identity, delicately creamy with lovely floral esters and a zesty feel that lasts. The NV 20 Years Old Tawny Porto is a typical Douro blend bottled in August 2022 with a Vinolok cork and 129 grams per liter of residual sugar. For a lot of folks, a 20 Year is the sweet spot in the lineup for Tawnies: It's fresh, so you don't worry about cracking fruit; it's reasonably complex, so it's old enough to be serious; and most of all, it is actually affordable compared to some of the really old ones. This is lovely. Showing a trace of caramel and darker chocolate flavors, this is still dominated by its freshness. Its lively acidity lifts the fruit and allows the flavors to dribble over the palate. It is tightly wound and very focused. It tastes great too, finishing with a touch of sugar and big fruit. That dries out with time and becomes a bit less exuberant and a bit more stern. It acquires a very serious demeanor. It is hard to resist. Best after 2022. "

694,Sine Qua Non Dark Blossom Grenache,2011,Grenache,California,409,15.75,0.0,0,"The 2011 Grenache Dark Blossom is probably the best Grenache-based blend in the vintage. A blend of 75% Grenache, 12.5% Syrah, 11.5% Mourvedre and a splash of Roussanne (fermented with 11% whole clusters), it has a perfumed, complex style, with notions of black raspberry, cassis, dried flowers, white pepper and licorice giving way to a full-bodied, layered and seamless mouthfeel. There’s no shortage of fruit here, and while it’s hard to resist now, it has enough tannin to warrant short-term cellaring. It should knock it out of the park through 2029. "

The palate is medium-bodied, silky and perfumed with lightly chalky tannins and seamless freshness on the long, spicy finish. Inviting red fruit and a sharpness of orange peel open the way to a juicy and supple midpalate of robust richness and weight that works well within the integrated tannin and oak. With underlying acidity, it remains fresh on the palate within its hearty fruit and layered texture. Well-structured, with concentrated red fruit and berry flavors, supported by a vibrant lattice of acidity and tannins. Minerally midpalate, featuring savory richness that extends on the vibrantly spiced finish. Drink now through 2025. This wine’s bold, succulent black-cherry flavor has the energy to override its oak aging, layering that tight fruit ripeness over sweet touches of caramel and almond. This is clean and spicy in its flavor detail, its acidity gentled by supple sweetness even as it keeps moving the flavors forward. Delicious with tea-smoked duck. Destemmed and aged 9 months in 35% new French oak, the 2017 Pinot Noir Sealift has a spicy, powerful bouquet of red and black fruits, pine forest, iodine, violets, and crushed rocks. This carries to a medium-bodied, juicy Pinot Noir with a firm, focused texture, ripe tannins, and a good finish. It's classic 2017 with its more savory, firm style, but it’s beautifully balanced and will evolve for at least 7-8 years. "

699,Geoffroy Expression,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,56,12.5,4.3,6,"Designed as a blend of two vintages, in this case near-equal amounts of 2014 and ’15, Expression is focused on red grapes (35 percent each pinot noir and meunier). Jean-Baptiste Geoffroy enriches the wine’s freshness with reserves that he stores in oak foudres. The combination is smooth and sophisticated, with ripe flavors of crisp apples over a supple texture. The finish is pale and chalky, leaving a clean, fresh feel. Aromas of crushed chalk, peaches and minerals with hints of crushed stone follow through to a full body with layers of fruit, fine phenolics and fresh acidity.

Inky dark fruit, mocha, floral notes and spice . All the elements come together so nicely. Picking a bit earlier than in the past helps preserve freshness as well as energy. Time in the glass brings out the wine's volume and resonance. The juicy, creamy style works well here. Inky dark red/purplish fruit, spice, rose petal and new leather build into the resonant finish. I find a bit better balance here than in the Alluvial Selection. "

Aromas of plum and truffle are joined by musky wild notes and a balsamic quality on the rather soft nose. Supple and savory right now, with brown spice and earth notes dominating the middle palate. Finishes with substantial dusty tannins and noteworthy length and grip. Not a particularly fruity style but has energy. Nicolas Groffier ventured the opinion that this vintage ""has stabilized since 2005"" and wondered out loud whether the wine's touch of sweetness, which he said was not apparent earlier, comes from its alcohol.

Good length, more structured than many Côtes-du-Rhônes.  Deep, savory nose with notes of ripe black cherries and plum cake, plus minty and floral notes. In spite of the considerable power and generous tannin, this is very focused and elegant. The long, energetic finish suggests this has years of life ahead of it. Bottled a month ago, the 2020 Côtes Du Rhône Coudoulet sports a vivid ruby hue and is a blend of 30% each of Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvedre, with the balance Cinsault. It’s a ripe, rounded, medium to full-bodied effort that has lots of ripe red and blue fruits as well as notes of peppery garrigue and leather.

Revealing a dense purple color as well as a killer nose of blueberries, chocolate-covered cherries, scorched earth, tobacco, violets, and exotic spices, it hits the palate with full-bodied richness, a seamless, pure, incredibly layered mouthfeel, building tannins, and a great, great finish. As with most top 2017s, it stays tight and compact on the palate, with notable structure and impressive concentration. It has some up-front appeal given its purity of fruit and balance, yet it's going to take 7-8 years to hit prime time and will be a long-lived bottle of Napa Cabernet. Hats off to Doug Shafer and the team for yet another magical Cabernet Sauvignon! This drips with rich blackberry, boysenberry and raspberry fruit flavors and is liberally laced with licorice root and singed alder notes, delivering a nice tarry tug through the finish as the fruit drips. Shows a twinge of the vintage's rusticity in its tannins, but it's a heck of an effort in this tricky year. Best from 2023 "
712,Staglin Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,325,14.9,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Staglin Family Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon is sturdy, satisfying, and long on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers excellent aromas and flavors of ripe berries, licorice, and oak. Serve it with the first cut from a prime rib. (Tasted: September 10, 2022, San Francisco, CA) A broad, loamy and frankly toasted style, with a steady rolling wave of warmed cassis and plum sauce supported by freshly plowed earth, sweet tobacco and licorice root. A little toothy through the finish, with a plum skin note hinting at overextraction, but the fruit wins out and fans of the muscular style will be pleased with this. "
713,Ornellaia Le Serre Nuove,2020,Bordeaux Red Blends,Italy,79,14.5,4.0,6,"The Ornellaia 2020 Bolgheri Rosso Le Serre Nuove dell'Ornellaia (a proprietary blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot) is a generous and darkly toned red blend that has the extra fruit fiber, sweetness and generous plumpness of a warm vintage. The fullness of the fruit is on full display, but in a very relaxed and natural manner. The wine never feels like too much. The tannins are yielding and velvety, and this purebred Tuscan red wraps thickly over the palate. It's poised for near- and medium-term drinking. This muscular red is saturated with cherry, plum, vanilla and earth flavors. As solid and sinewy as the tannic structure is, the fruit matches it step by step on the long finish. "
714,Paul Hobbs George Menini Estate Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,79,14.2,0.0,0,"The 2020 Chardonnay George Menini Estate is lifted with fresh tarragon, flint, and candied green apple. The palate is all about its chalky mineral texture and vibrant energy. Not to confuse this with losing balance or feeling underripe, it has plenty of fruit, with lemon confit, fresh green apple, and a touch of warming baking spice. Allow another year or two in cellar and drink 2023-2034. Yellow apple, dried pineapple and lemon meringue flavors are fresh and generous, accented with notes of nutmeg and orange sherbet and backed by vibrant acidity. Drink now through 2034. "
715,Tour Saint Christophe Les Terrasses de Saint Christophe,2014,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,18,14,3.8,314,"Complex aromas burst through, refined sleek oak overlaying herbaceous dark fruits and a savoury iron background. Black plums and cherries dominate the spicy cocoa palate, with crystalline minerality and a long, confident, peppery, finish. My passion for Bordeaux began as a young wine guy. I was in my early 20s. I had just got indoctrinated with some of California's finest 1973 Cabernet Sauvignons—I will never forget the magical Caymus Vineyard that I first retailed for $5.00 a bottle (it was on an introductory post-off). As the years went on, I just fell in love with the wines from both the Médoc and the Right Bank. As I grew up, I ended more and more in the Saint-Émilion camp. The 2014 Les Terrasses de Saint Christophe is a damn fine wine. The wine is smooth, satiny, revels with delectable red currants. The wine's crisp finish pairs it well with a piping hot, lightly-seasoned rotisserie chicken. I encourage all of you to imbibe the Grand Crus of Saint-Émilion. (Tasted: November 9, 2017, San Francisco, CA) I like the aromas of blackberries, mushrooms and bark that flow through to a palate with a medium body, fine-grained tannins and a fresh finish. A thoroughly delicious wine from Château Tour Saint Christophe. Drink now and enjoy. "
716,Louis Latour Ardeche Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,France,14,0,4.1,30,"COMMENTARY: The Louis Latour Ardèche Chardonnay is one of the world's best values in this omnipresent grape variety, and the 2019 vintage is an excellent effort. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers ripe fruits and notes of chalk in its aromas and flavors. Enjoy it with sautéed Petrale sole in a mix of stir-fried broccoli. (Tasted: April 6, 2022, San Rafael, CA) "
717,Domaine Sigaut Chambolle-Musigny Les Chatelots Premier Cru,2018,Pinot Noir,France,119,13.5,0.0,0,"The 2018 Chambolle-Musigny 1er Cru Les Chatelots has turned out nicely, offering up a pretty bouquet of cherries, raspberries and plums, complemented by hints of raw cocoa and a discrete framing of wood. Medium to full-bodied, velvety and fleshy, it's nicely defined, with a deep core of fruit, lively acids and a sapid finish. "
718,R. Lopez de Heredia Vina Bosconia Reserva,2010,Tempranillo,Spain,42,0,4.1,5,"Dried flowers and dark fruit on the nose with some mahogany and bark. Medium-bodied with fine tannins and lovely polish and length. Compact and long. Tangy, too. Special wine, showing its age and tradition. Decant an hour before serving. Drink or hold. The fresh and balanced 2010 Viña Bosconia Reserva is a textbook example of the wine, perhaps the successor of the great 2006, a powerful blend of 80% Tempranillo, 15% Garnacha and 5% between Graciano and Mazuelo. It matured in used American oak barrels for five years and is clean and complex with a nutty and mushroomy nose, polished tannins and good acidity. "
719,Peyrassol Les Commandeurs Rose,2021,Rosé,France,29,0,0.0,0,"Exuberant in its fruit character, this rosé layers dragonfruit, watermelon and lemon-lime citrus notes, finishing honeyed and rich. It took two days for that complexity to emerge from the finish, so decant it before serving with salmon sashimi. "
720,Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte Le Petit Haut Lafitte,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,32,14.5,4.1,8,"Spices, such as cloves and white pepper, with violets and dark fruit follow through to a full body with firm, chewy tannins and a polished yet intense finish. Open tannins. An ash-like undertone to it. Best after 2027. The more Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated second wine, the 2019 Le Petit Haut Lafitte is dense purple. with a promising bouquet of cassis, cedary spice, tobacco leaf, and background oak. It picks up some classic Graves scorched earth notes as it sits in the glass and is medium to full-bodied, has a concentrated, layered, balanced mouthfeel, and a great finish. A serious, impressive wine, it will benefit from 2-3 years of bottle age and drink brilliantly over the following 10-15. Best After 2024 Closed up on the opening bars, a little more austere than the 2018 with tight tannins but opens up to show elegance and balance, and the juicy salinity on the finish that has become so characteristic of Smith Haut Lafitte across its range of wines. Ripe and silky, with alluring warmed cassis and mulled plum flavors and a red licorice accent. The finish, which is carried by lightly singed cedar and grilled savory notes, lets the fruit have the upper hand. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Drink now. "
721,Andreola Mas de Fer Rive di Soligo,Prosecco,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Italy,21,11.5,3.4,11,"Herby, floral nose; light, progressive palate with a lovely delicate airy texture and intense flavours on the finish of grapefruit peel, apple and almonds. Very refined, from high-altitude vineyards. "
722,Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou Croix de Beaucaillou,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,44,14.3,0.0,0,"The second wine of this great château is the 2019 La Croix Ducru-Beaucaillou, which is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 46% Merlot, and the rest Petit Verdot that was raised in 60% new barrels. It fits into the lineup beautifully and sits nicely between the Le Petit Ducru and the Grand Vin. Deep purple-hued, with full-bodied aromas and flavors of pure cassis, crushed stone, graphite, lead pencil, and smoked tobacco, it has building yet fine tannins, flawless balance, and a great finish. It shows the more regal, classy, elegant, yet still concentrated style of this vintage perfectly. Give bottles a healthy decant if drinking any time soon, and it will have upwards of two decades of prime drinking. Best After 2022 "
723,Chateau Pape Clement (Futures Pre-Sale),2020,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,97,0,0.0,0,"This is snazzed up with flashy toast, but there's ample mulberry, cassis and plum compote fruit to soak it up, while notes of licorice and sweet spice fill in the background. A late tug of warm earth keeps this grounded. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. "
724,Nickel & Nickel Hayne Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,109,14.5,0.0,0,"From a four-acre section planted in 1995 and 2002, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Hayne Vineyard features aromas of red cherries and redcurrants despite being matured in 50% new French oak. It's medium to full-bodied on the palate, silky and elegant, with a long, finely dusty finish that reminds me of u-pick strawberries on a dry June day. Ripe, soft-edged and generous in style, with a kiss of vanilla guiding plum compote and blackberry preserve flavors along, while an echo of light savory keeps the fruit honest through the finish. Accessible now thanks to the polished feel, but the fruit will last a while in the cellar. "
725,Joseph Drouhin Meursault,2020,Chardonnay,France,88,0,0.0,0,"A classically structured wine for this appellation with the weight and round generosity that we expect from it, but with plenty of bright citrus and pear fruit, something these wines can lack a bit of. Good depth with an excellent integration of chalky minerality and healthy acidity at the long and delicate finish. With aeration a touch of vanilla bean develops on the nose. Drink or hold. "
726,Vietti Barbera d'Asti Tre Vigne,2020,Barbera,Italy,19,14.5,3.9,45,"COMMENTARY: The 2020 Vietti Barbera d'Asti Tre Vigne is bright, attractive, and zesty.

727,La Rioja Alta Gran Reserva 904 Tinto (1.5 Liter Magnum),2011,Tempranillo,Spain,169,13.5,0.0,0,"Lovely dried red fruit, such as plums with just a hint of prunes. Cedar, walnut and leather undertones. Full-bodied with lots of fruit, considering its age, as well as hints of smoke, tobacco, bark and black tea. Some balsamic at the finish. Traditionally styled with lovely results. Drink or hold. COMMENTARY: The 2011 La Rioja Alta Gran Reserva 904 highlights the beauty and complexity of the Tempranillo grapes. These vines—over 60 years old—offer excellent and persistent richness. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits juicy, ripe berries and wood notes in its aromas and flavors. Enjoy it with braised meat dishes. (Tasted: June 2, 2020, San Francisco, CA) Oak and red fruit nose. The palate has mouth-watering acidity, fine-grained/well-knit tannins and notes of citrus peel, spice and baked brambles. Long finish. I usually prefer the 904 to the 890, but there will be no Gran Reserva 890 until the 2010 vintage (from the last vintage I tasted, 2005). So, the only one of the extended-aging Haro-style reds I tasted this time was the 2011 Gran Reserva 904, which had a hard act to follow after the 2010 vintage. It's a blend of 89% Tempranillo and 11% Graciano matured in American oak barrels for four years, and it was racked eight times from barrel to barrel during its élevage, which sounds a bit harsh for a vintage like 2011 when the wines were not as complete and robust as in 2010. It has the classic profile, aromas and flavors (decayed leaves, tobacco, sweet spices, a meaty touch and some black fruit), but the oak seems to take a more leading role and the palate feels less juicy. It finishes dry. "
728,Chateau Petit Bocq,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,27,14.5,3.6,20,"Enticing and aromatic, with black and blue fruit on the nose, while the palate is dressed with liquorice, nutmeg and a beautiful, cool graphite minerality. Lovely aromas of walnuts, bark, dark berries and currants follow though to a full body with round, juicy tannins that are rich and layered. Long, flavorful finish. Very balanced for the vintage. Try after 2024. "
729,Clos de l'Oratoire,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,44,14.1,4.3,6,"Ripe black fruit (there's some red fruit as well), tobacco leaf, damp earth, exotic flowers, and some chocolaty notes all emerge from the 2019 Clos De L'Oratoire, another beautiful wine from the Neipperg family and team. Rich, medium to full-bodied, and seamless on the palate, I love its mid-palate, it has gorgeous tannins, no hard edges, and a great finish. This is clearly a great vintage for this cuvée. Hide bottles for 4-5 years, and it's going to have 2-3 decades of longevity, and probably a gradual decline after that as well. It's beautiful. Best After 2026 Stephan von Neipperg's 2019 Clos de l'Oratoire has turned out very nicely in bottle, opening in the glass to reveal aromas of sweet wild berries, cherries, loamy soil and raw cocoa. Medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, it's broad and succulent, with lively acids, powdery tannins and a nicely defined finish. It's produced from holdings on sandy-clay soils in the northeast of Saint-Émilion. Best after 2021. Shows steeped red and black currant fruit that mingles with tobacco, worn cedar and savory notes, with a streak of warm cast iron through the finish. Slightly rustic in feel but has character and range, with good energy throughout. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2023. "
730,M. Chapoutier Cotes du Rhone Belleruche Rouge,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,17,14,4.3,64,"This well-made Cotes-du-Rhone has attractive red-fruit aromas, but also some meaty depth. Generous body and appealing roundness on the palate, the gently dry tannins giving it some backbone at the surprisingly long finish. A blend based on grenache and syrah. Drink now. "
731,Two Angels Sauvignon Blanc,2020,Sauvignon Blanc,California,25,13.6,3.8,11,"Smooth, rich, and lush, with tangy, citrusy acidity and excellent depth of flavor Aromas of sliced apple, lemon, fresh pear and honeydew melon. Medium-bodied, fruity and straightforward. 100% sauvignon blanc. COMMENTARY: The 2020 Angels Sauvignon Blanc is rich and well-balanced on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of dried earth, fragrant spices, and tart apples. Serve it with a plate of oysters on the half-shell. (Tasted: November 14, 2022, Napa, CA) "
732,Brocard Vau de Vey Chablis Premier Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,39,12.5,0.0,0,"Initially reductive notes of scorched earth and smoke in this wine dissipate with aeration, revealing pristine yellow apple and Mirabelle. Edged by a crush of oyster shells and salty mineral tones, this invigorating sip finishes on a whisper of white pepper. The wine is just starting to open now but should drink well through 2030. "
733,Zuccardi Q Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,22,14,3.9,19,"Plenty of blackcurrant and iodine aromas with some cassis-bush undertones. Full-bodied with juicy fruit and a pure, fruity finish. Very clear and manicured on the palate. Firm yet integrated tannin's. Hints of wet earth to the currant character. Better after 2023. I found more freshness in the 2019 Q Cabernet Sauvignon than in the 2018 I also tasted next to it. This is produced with grapes from Gualtallary and La Consulta, combining structure from Gualtallary and juiciness from La Consulta. Cabernet behaves better in cooler years like this 2020, and the wine matured in a combination of 225- and- 500-liter oak barrels. It's medium to full-bodied and has the telltale fine tannin's from the grape and a chalky finish. "
734,A.R. Lenoble Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs,2012,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,99,12.5,0.0,0,"Attractive toffee and caramel notes on the nose with pear tart, apple crumble, praline, chalk and nougat. Rich, creamy and delicious with soft and rounded bubbles. Well integrated. Caressing and delicious finish. Chardonnay from Chouilly. Grand cru Chardonnay and a low dosage set this Champagne up for a great future. That is to say, with its concentrated minerality contrasting with Meyer lemon fruitiness, the wine is only just hinting at some nuttiness and has far to go. Drink from 2022. A lively Champagne, well-knit and lacy in texture, with an expressive mix of yellow peach, candied ginger, honeysuckle and toasted almond. There's a pleasing juiciness to the graphite- and spice-accented finish. Drink now through 2027. Herbal nose of fern notes, roast apricot, rosemary and crème brûlée aromas. Well-structured on the palate, showing charm and finesse. "
735,Codorniu Anna de Codorniu Cava Blanc de,Blancs,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Spain,15,11.5,4.0,229,"The enticing lemon and apple nose pulls you into this ripe and elegant sparkling wine with a long, compact finish. This is a Cava of major historical importance and yet is just as relevant today. Fresh white peach, grapefruit and lime peel deliver softly onto the palate. You can't miss the stand-out packaging. "
736,Delas Hermitage Les Bessards,2017,Syrah/Shiraz,France,290,14,0.0,0,"Archetypal Les Bessards, the Delas 2017 Hermitage Les Bessards boasts rich, deep cassis fruit accented by hints of crushed stone and pencil shavings. It's full-bodied, ripe yet firm, with great energy, freshness and length on the spice-tinged finish. While relatively approachable young, it should age well for up to two decades. Tasted twice (once blind), with one bottle showing more peppery spice, red berries and cured-meat notes. Deep, undulating layers of cassis and mulberry are shaded by hints of cinnamon, charred meat and coffee bean in this hulking Syrah. It's a rich, plushly textured sip but gripped by a firm, penetrating frame of tannins. Stunning but a bit unwieldy in youth, it would be best cellared till 2022, but the wine will reward patience. A sleek, mineral-edged version, with black cherry and black currant puree flavors streaming through, laced with singed mesquite notes, a flash of iron and a lingering sanguine echo. Restrained in style but not lacking energy, delivering a nice piercing feel at the very end. Best from 2020 through 2032. This is set in darker fruit tones with a rich and ripe plum and blackberry core, as well as graphite and sarsaparilla. Some hung meat and suave oak spices. The palate has very vertical, mouth-filling presence and a very bright, clear and vibrant style that delivers a long, sweetly spiced blackberry and black-cherry core. Try from 2025. "
737,Talenti Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,50,15,0.0,0,"Dark-berry and cherry character with bark and mahogany in both the nose and palate. It’s full-bodied with integrated tannins. Linear and tight with a long finish. Needs time to open and soften. Try after 2023. The Talenti 2017 Brunello di Montalcino shows a lot of soft and ripe fruit with blackberry and cherry confit at the front. Spice, leather, crushed flower and potting soil follow in due course and so does the wine's impactful 15% alcohol. This red delivers an intense beam of cherry and red berry fruit notes, shaded by tobacco, sanguine and leafy vegetal flavors. Has a bright structure, but finishes on the dry side, revealing a spicy aftertaste. Best from 2025 "

The structure is tight, the flavors clean in the end, ready to serve with tea-smoked chicken.  "
739,Penfolds St. Henri Shiraz,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,150,0,0.0,0,"A great St. Henri and, although multi-regional, this is very much a wine that speaks of the Barossa Valley, with aromas of ripe blackberries and red plums that are so fresh, together with tobacco, young-leather, earth, chocolate, coal-smoke and tarry accents. Effortless depth on the palate with summer berries, framed in fine, alabaster-like tannins that are underscored with discreet power. So long and captivating. A blend of Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Port Lincoln, Robe, Padthaway, Clare Valley and Adelaide Hills. Drink over the next decade or more. Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Port Lincoln, Robe, Padthaway, Clare Valley and Adelaide Hills fruit. Matured 12 months in 50+yo vats. The effortless, unassuming self-assuredness of St Henri holds a unique and beloved place in the assemblage of Penfolds heroes, and 2018 marks a particularly special release. Accomplished, spicy, glossy black fruits of grand integrity unfold to magnificent effect in the glass, contrasting a fine-boned frame of rigid yet graceful, powder-fine tannins that carry a finish of long-lingering line and alluring appeal. I look forward to spectating from the sidelines as its fruit slowly unfurls over the decades to come. An adorable St Henri that exemplifies all that this label stands for. The 2018 St Henri Shiraz is a terrific effort, perhaps rivaling the top-flight wines under this label in 1976 and 1986. Remarkably fine and silky in texture yet simultaneously dense and concentrated, it showcases the amazing fruit harvested in 2018. Boysenberry, mulberry and mocha shadings all swirl together effortlessly in a whorl of full-bodied elegance, finishing long and effortless. Mainly Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale, it includes smaller amounts of fruit from Port Lincoln, Robe, Padthaway, Clare Valley and the Adelaide Hills, all aged 12 months in large old wooden vats. Post WWII, as winemaking moved into the modern era, there was a decade’s long shift toward stainless steel and new oak barrels. At Penfolds, that shift began with Max Schubert’s development of Grange, finishing top selections of shiraz in new French oak barrels. But the company never abandoned its old oak vats, sustaining an alternate top selection of shiraz as St. Henri, which never sees a barrel. This 2018 takes St. Henri’s savory style toward richness, lasting on sweet blueberry fragrance and gentle, meaty tannins. The wine needs a day or two to open; better to wait on it in the cellar for a decade or more, when it will deliver its riches and restraint with complexity. "
740,Domaine Laroque Cite de Carcassonne Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,France,16,12.5,4.4,72,"Fresh pears, apricots, lemons and apple blossoms on the nose. Medium-bodied with fresh acidity and a creamy, succulent and fruity palate. Smooth and caressing. "
741,Calera de Villiers Vineyard Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,California,79,14.6,0.0,0,"Deeper ruby, the 2017 Pinot Noir De Villiers Vineyard reveals more black raspberry, sassafras, tea, and spicy notes. It's medium-bodied, with a juicy, elegant style and a great finish. De Villiers is an east-facing site more or less in the middle of Calera’s Mt. Harlan vineyards, planted in 1997. In 2017, it produced a wine considerably more savory than most of its counterparts, with a wild berry scent and tealike accents. The fruit flavors are light and attenuated, more about perfume than flavor, marked by the tangy, mildly mineral grip of the mountain’s chalk soils. Well-sculpted, with alluring sandalwood and allspice notes to the dried cherry and plum tart flavors. Savory richness emerges midpalate, leading to an extended finish that offers brioche and cream details. Roasted boysenberry, crushed stone, baked earth and a slight plum-skin tang show on the nose of this bottling from vines planted in 1996. There's a warm-weather sense on the palate, where cooked berry flavors dominate, yet the acid and rocky tension keep it complex and intense. "
742,Bernardus Griva Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,California,18,12.3,0.0,0,"Briny limes, green apple peels and dark grass cuttings show on the nose of this bottling, which is reminiscent of a Kiwi style.The palate is grassy in style as well, with lime and grapefruit peel flavors also showing.

744,Faire La Fete,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,19,12,4.3,143,"Produced in the traditional method, the wine spent 15 months sur lie before disgorgement. The blend of Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, and Pinot Noir stirs the senses with aromas of pear, vanilla wafer, and lemon peel. Bubbles dissipate into a creamy texture. Notes of fresh linen, apple, and white flowers come through in a delicate manner. "
745,Silverado Miller Ranch Sauvignon Blanc,2020,Sauvignon Blanc,California,27,13.2,3.7,8,"With 7% Semillon added in, the aromatics are breathtaking – a searing wedge of lime squeezed over juicy pineapple. Honeydew melon, Key lime, and grapefruit converge on the palate. Perky notes of tangerine spark a sensational note with white flower petals. Honeyed pears address the lean-bodied, athletic white on the crisp finish. Blended with 7% Sémillon and stainless-steel fermented, this is a sleek, acid-driven white. It offers a tart layer of grapefruit that builds to a richer core of pear and vanilla candy. Cohesive and complex, it is an enjoyable wine. Peach, green apple, passion fruit and lime on the nose. Medium-bodied, crisp and fruity. Tangy, clean finish. "

It too is medium to full-bodied, has beautiful opulence, ripe tannins, and a great finish. Deep garnet-purple in color, it has a wonderfully perfumed nose of violets and black cherries, plus hints of dried mint, dark chocolate and clove oil. Full-bodied, the palate is densely laden with black fruits and minty layers, framed by firm, grainy tannins, finishing long and earthy. "
749,Hess Lion Tamer Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,65,14.5,4.5,15,"Lush and fleshy, with cassis, boysenberry and blackberry preserve notes guided by hints of alder and mesquite. Stays open but defined through the finish, with a buried hint of sweet tobacco. Drink now through 2027. With 10% Petite Sirah and 7% Malbec, this Cabernet Sauvignon is effusively bright in dense layers of fruit. A moderate grip of tannin helps to give it additional power and length around a juicy midpalate of blueberry and vanilla. Concentrated nose of blackberry and blackcurrant jam, cocoa, cloves and vanilla. It’s full-bodied with firm, succulent tannins. Rich, generous layers of jammy fruit, sweet tobacco and spices.

This 70,000-bottle release is creamy and rich in texture, with lots of plump primary flavors and absolutely no rough edges. Strawberries, red cherries, bark, walnuts, cedar and chocolate orange on the nose with hints of truffle. Medium-bodied with firm, chalky tannins. Focused and flavorful. Better from 2022. "
752,Domaine les Pallieres Gigondas Terrasse du Diable,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,45,14.5,4.2,13,"Very dense and complex with aromas ranging from black plum to wild thyme, as well as hints of candied orange, smoke and dry earth. In spite of all the richness and concentration of this imposing Gigondas, the slightly rustic tannins give this a lot of drive and accentuate the freshness. Long, chalky finish. Moving to the 2019s from bottle, the 2019 Gigondas Terrasse Du Diable has loads of chalky minerality as well as bright cherry and strawberry fruits, medium to full body, hints of white flowers and pepper, and building yet polished, fine tannins. It will evolve for 15 years. "
753,Tiefenbrunner Pinot Grigio,2021,Pinot Gris/Grigio,Italy,18,12.5,4.2,18,"Crisp and tangy, this savory white delivers green apple, juicy citrus and honeydew melon flavors underscored by vibrant acidity. Notes of white almond and saline signal the close. "
754,Domaine Raymond Usseglio Chateauneuf-du-Pape La Part des Anges,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,79,14.5,0.0,0,"An unusual and impressive Chateauneuf-du-Pape with a slew of elderberries and a licorice character. Enormous structure and concentration, the full tannins are already well integrated. The depth at the fundamental finish suggests this needs a lot more time to reach its best. A blend of 70% mourvedre, 20% grenache and 10% syrah. From Demeter-certified biodynamically grown grapes. Drinkable now, but best from 2024. Ripe and lush, with waves of dark currant, crushed plum and warmed fig backed by a graphite spine for form, while Turkish coffee, ganache and warm earth hints fill in on the finish. Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah. Best from 2024 "
755,William Fevre Chablis Les Preuses Grand Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,169,0,0.0,0,"The 2020 Chablis Grand Cru Les Preuses is, if anything, even more electric than the formidable Valmur, wafting from the glass with notions of citrus oil, freshly baked bread, oyster jus and wet stones. Full-bodied, satiny and chiseled, it's racy and intense, with a bright spine of acidity and a long, intensely saline finish. From 1.5ha on soils that are high in clay content above Bougros, together with 1ha just above Bouguerots. Distinct precision here, not a blockbuster but intense and focused. Lovely crystalline fruit and will age beautifully. "
756,Graham Beck Brut Methode Cap,Classique,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Africa,20,12.5,4.1,124,"The Graham Beck wines are classic in style and a good value, reliable alternative to Champagne. Here we have bready aromas allied to some New World fruitiness, and although the complexity of good Champagne is lacking, it’s a very well-made traditional method wine. The Non-Vintage Brut has pretty apricot and mango scents that are lively and vivacious. The palate is lively on the entry with crisp acidity, citrus peel on the entry with a terse but very focused finish. This is one of the best showings for Pieter Ferreira's sparkler. "
757,Henschke Julius Eden Valley Riesling,2022,Riesling,Australia,51,11.5,0.0,0,"This has such vibrant and pure, tangy fruit. Lime zest, lemons, white flowers, green apples, slate and shells. Dusty crushed stones, too. Sharp and precise, with a medium body and mouthwatering acidity. This is very fruity and dense, with a column of fruit that goes deep in to the wine.  2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the Julius Riesling, and what a vintage to be able to commemorate. 2022 was blisteringly good, seemingly everywhere in South Australia (and Western Australia too), and that was never more true than for Riesling. Here, in the 2022 Julius Riesling, the tension and savory precision that marks Julius is out in full force; the wine this year is littered with preserved lemon, brine, pith and crushed shells (odd, sure, given the non-proximity to ocean!) and, more interesting, leafy things too, like green tea and orchard leaves. Kaffir lime, also? Excellent. "
758,Billecart-Salmon Cuvee Elisabeth Salmon Brut Rose,2009,Sparkling Rosé,France,229,0,0.0,0,"Incorporating fully 10% still red wine, Billecart's 2009 Brut Rosé Cuvée Elisabeth Salmon is showing beautifully, delivering fragrant aromas of plums, stone fruits, petals, sweet spices and marzipan. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and elegant, it's seamless and pillowy, with bright acids and a pure, precise profile, concluding with a bright, saline finish. In 2009, it was vinified entirely in stainless steel. Copper-orange color with aromas of grapefruit pith, cherry stones, dried roses, white pepper, pastries, walnuts and oyster shells. Refined and elegant with pretty, dried red and citrus fruit, layered with subtle spice and toast. Fine bubbles. Dry. 55% pinot noir from Mareuil-sur-Ay and Ay, and 45% Grand Cru chardonnay from Cote des Blancs, with 10% of pinot noir red wine. Dosage 7g/L. Disgorged in July 2021. Drink or hold. One of the great roses, this Champagne named after a member of the family, is ripe with layers of red fruits and tight acidity. This vintage is still amazingly young, fresh and crisp with only a hint of maturity creeping in at the end. Drink now An elegant rosé Champagne that seamlessly knits juicy acidity and fine-grained texture with a subtle, smoke-laced underpinning and a delicate mesh of wild strawberry, kirsch, mandarin orange peel and toasted brioche flavors. Harmonious, with an open-knit, spiced finish. Chardonnay and Pinot Noir "
759,Eisele Vineyard Altagracia Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,169,0,0.0,0,"There’s purity and focus to this wine with blackberry, blackcurrant and spices, such as nutmeg. Ink pot, bark and asphalt, too. So long and polished. Chewy tannins. Hints of stone and ash. 88% cabernet sauvignon. 7% cabernet franc and 5% petit verdot. Give it time to soften, but already a beauty. Drink after 2026. Very deep garnet-purple in color, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Altagracia springs from the glass with vibrant scents of crushed black cherries, ripe, juicy blackcurrants and blackberry coulis, plus hints of cardamom, cumin seed, tree bark and crushed rocks. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is chock-full of expressive black fruits with firm and fine-grained tannins and beautiful freshness, finishing long and spicy. "
760,Chateau L'Evangile,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,299,15.5,4.4,5,"Stunning aromas of blackberries, black olives, brown sugar and dried flowers. Tar. Full-bodied, dense and layered. Superfine tannins, yet this is muscular and long. An amazing wine reminiscent of the great L’Evangiles of the 1950s. Straight track. Goes on and on. Truly great wine. Try in 2024. Just a baby. In the running for the most opulent, sensationally textured, massive wine in the vintage is the 2015 L'Evangile and if tasting this beauty doesn’t make your heart rate increase, I don’t know what will. Made from 84% Merlot and 16% Cabernet Franc brought up in plenty of new oak, its ruby/plum color is followed by an awesome bouquet of blackberry jam, smoked meats, licorice, truffle, and hints of chocolate. Thick, opulent, super ripe, and decadent, with a full-bodied mouthfeel that needs to be tasted to be believed, it still stays balanced and fresh on the palate and is already impossible to resist. It’s going to keep for 3+ decades. This is one of those wines I wish every reader could taste! Dark and dense, with a brooding personality, offering a mix of warm tobacco, espresso, dark earth, well-steeped black currant and fig fruit flavors. Finishes with a broad loamy swath of fruit and tobacco, showing a strong echo of mocha and tar. This packs some serious punch. Best from 2024 through 2040. Densely tannic, this wine displays considerable power and concentration. With 84% Merlot it exhibits jammy, rich black-plum and blackberry fruit and powerful tannins. This is an enormous wine, still very firm. Best after 2026 After the slightly leaner 2014, this is a full-bodied, rich, opulent Evangile with a powerful presence of ripe tannin and freshness provided by the 16% Cabernet Franc. Weighty but refined and with staying power. "
761,Mumm Napa Cuvee,M,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,California,22,12.5,4.0,180,"An unusual blend of 48% Chardonnay, 43% Pinot Noir, 6% Pinot Gris and 3% Pinot Meunier, this is pale sunflower-yellow, with a thick mousse and well-developed layers of orange blossom, lemon and pear. "
762,Pietradolce Etna Rosso Vigna Barbagalli,2017,Other Red Blends,Italy,119,15,0.0,0,"This is the top red wine made by Pietradolce, and its striking black label is meant to underline its importance in the estate portfolio. The 2017 Etna Rosso Barbagalli offers a pretty garnet color and a lean to mid-weight approach. Made with fruit from pre-phylloxera vines from one of the highest elevation vineyards in the appellation (at 950 meters above sea level), this is always a study in elegance, and the integrity of the fruit transcends most problematic vintage variations thanks to the hearty resilience of the vines and their extended root systems. This wine shows composure and equilibrium with an incredibly glossy or silky quality of fruit with berry, smoke, tar and campfire ash. That old-vine concentration and power (with 15% alcohol) also comes through clearly. Layers of smoke, ash, crushed walnuts and cranberries on the nose. It’s medium-to full-bodied with sleek, tight tannins. Lots of ripe and dried red fruit on the palate with citrus peel and tobacco, too. Precise and tight finish. Lots of old-vine magic here. Barbagalli is a one-hectare amphitheatre of 80- to 100-year-old vines in Contrada Rampante on Etna's northern slopes at 950m, producing up to 2,000 bottles. It undergoes maceration on the skins for 18 days in concrete tanks, followed by 20 months in French tonneaux. It has a huge structure paired with masses of freshness characterised by a balsamic character and clean acidity. The wood has yet to integrate but it's clear that this is one of Etna's finest reds: black cherry, earth, dark berries and some dried fruit give it a sense of plushness, while the fine tannins and lively acidity give it the legs to last. Big and concentrated, this has aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, scorched soil and menthol. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, the brawny, chewy palate offers prune marinated in spirits, licorice and vanilla alongside close-grained tannins that leave a drying finish. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol. "
763,Whitehall Lane Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,50,14.9,4.2,13,"Notes of blackcurrants, baking spices and chocolate with leafy character. Full and chewy with soft tannins that frame the wine. Sensation of graphite-like minerality. Tight finish. Drink after 2023. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Whitehall Lane Cabernet Sauvignon is a picture-perfect example of what a Napa Cab should be. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of black fruit, licorice, and a hint of oak. Pair it with a Carne Asada Burrito. (Tasted: August 29, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Nearly all Cabernet Sauvignon (there's 2% Petit Verdot), the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon combines notes of ripe cherries with resinous herbs and vanilla on the nose, while the medium to full-bodied palate is silky and ripe, delivering plenty of red-berried flavor. Sure, it could be richer and more textured, more concentrated and dense, but then it probably wouldn't sell for $50. It's a solid bargain in terms of Napa Cabernet. Best after 2022 "
764,Allan Scott Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc,2022,Sauvignon Blanc,Zealand,16,12,4.2,16,"COMMENTARY: I have kept a keen eye on the Allan Scott wines over the past several years, and the 2022 Sauvignon Blanc has rewarded me. TASTING NOTES: This wine is not a blockbuster but is on point as a Marlborough wine. It offers aromas and flavors of grapefruit peel that are rewarding and pleasing. Serve it with pan-fried crabcakes. (Tasted: October 20, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "
765,Andre Robert Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut,Nature,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,79,12,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The André Robert Champagne Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut Nature dazzles the palate with its pinpoint balance and refined style. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with excellent aromas and flavors of tart apples and bright citrus. Pair it with Hamachi and Haas avocado handrolls. (Tasted: September 15, 2021, San Francisco, CA) The NV Brut Nature Les Jardins du Mesnil was disgorged in February 2021. Exhibiting aromas of citrus zest, nougat, white flowers and wet stones, it's medium to full-bodied, pillowy and precise, with lively acids and a seamless profile, complemented by an attractive pinpoint mousse.

768,Buehler Estate Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,45,14.6,4.5,10,"The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Estate has a medium to deep garnet-purple color and expressive notes of crushed blackberries, wild blueberries and cassis plus suggestions of bay leaves, clove oil and unsmoked cigars with a hint of cardamom. Medium-bodied and elegantly styled, the palate is chock-full of bright, crunchy black fruit with subtle, invigorating dried herbs accents and approachable, grainy tannins, finishing with a lively lift. Impressively priced for the quality here, it is drinking beautifully right now, and should cellar for a good 12 years+. Stock up! Blueberries, cedar and mushrooms on the nose. It is medium-bodied with soft tannins and a juicy texture. Lots of toasted oak. Needs two or three years to come together. A step up, the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Estate reveals loads of classic Cabernet herbal tones as well as plenty of darker currant fruits, notes of tobacco, chocolate, and earth, medium to full-bodied richness, and a round, supple, nicely textured mouthfeel that keeps you coming back to the glass. It’s well done and ideal for enjoying over the coming 8-10 years. Bell peppers, menthol, and charcoal dust aromas. The texture is deeper and more dark-fruited than the entry Buehler Cabernet, with flavours of black currants, cedar and black pepper. The acid/tannin balance is well-calibrated for early consumption. An overall solid value.  Delivers an enticing beam of creamed plum and boysenberry fruit inlaid with warm anise and mocha hints, ending with an echo of sassafras as the fruit sails through. One for the hedonist crowd.  "
769,Tolaini Valdisanti Toscana,2019,Other Red Blends,Italy,45,13.5,0.0,0,"Pretty aromas and flavors of currants, asphalt and bark fill the glass. It’s medium-to full-bodied with creamy tannins and a long, flavorful finish. Unfiltered. Drink in 2024 and onwards. A polished red, this offers plum, blackberry, black currant, leather and a hint of wild herb aromas and flavors. Balanced and harmonious, with refined tannins gracing the long, iron-tinged finish. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2024 through 2040. "
770,Grgich Hills Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (375ML half-bottle),2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,39,14.2,0.0,0,"Plenty of blackcurrants, flowers and sandalwood on the nose, following through to a full body with tight, creamy tannins that give the wine polish and beauty. Give it a year or two to soften, but already very attractive. "
771,Tour Saint Christophe,2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,36,14.5,4.0,97,"From a picturesque vineyard on the east side of Saint-Emilion, not far from Chateau Barde-Haut the 2017 Chateau Tour Saint Christophe checks in as a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc that was brought up in a mix of new and used barrels. This inky purple-hued beauty boasts stunning notes of blue fruits, crushed rocks, violets, and spring flowers. Medium to full-bodied, beautifully concentrated, and with remarkable purity as well as finesse in its tannins, this is another remarkable wine from this estate, which has been turning out brilliant wines in every vintage now. Don't miss it. Tasted twice. A spicy, fresh and intense red on the nose with chocolate. Medium to full body and very fine tannins that give a creamy texture. Juicy and long. A blend of 80% merlot and 20% cabernet franc. Want to drink it now, but better after 2022. "
772,Terre del Barolo Barolo,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,28,14,4.5,53,"COMMENTARY: The 2017 Terre del Barolo Barolo is biting and zesty on the palate.

773,Ravines Argetsinger Vineyard Dry Riesling,2019,Riesling,U.S.,34,12.5,4.4,5,"The Argetsinger cuvée is a tour de force in this vintage, with the abundant aromas of nectarine and green apple of the 'regular' dry Riesling. Yet, the limestone soil of the mild slopes in this southeast corner of Lake Seneca shines through in the verdant and saline minerality that sets this wine apart. Piercingly lovely acidity but more than enough exuberant peachy fruit shot through with floral notes to bring this exciting wine into dynamic balance and carry it to an immensely satisfying finish. Its tightly wound structure and silky finesse ensures it should age for decades. Perhaps America's preeminent Riesling. Drinking Window: 2021 - 2031. The 2019 Dry Riesling Argetsinger Vineyard, another late release, has just two grams of sugar plus 8.7 grams of total acidity and 12.8% alcohol. The regular Dry Riesling shows so well that some might wonder why they should trade up. It's a fair question since the difference in price is over $10 in a region known for its bargains. Many will be perfectly happy stopping there. Still, I'd say this is the better wine and that will become even clearer as they both age (and likely separate a bit more). This is more impressive for expressive fruit. It seems more like the essence of Riesling, unfolding slowly over your tongue and coating the palate until some bursts of acidity crop up. Like its regular 2019 sibling, though, it is relatively integrated and balanced, with not a hair out of place. If anything, it seems more refined and graceful. The slight tart aspect on the finish provides a bit of spice, but it never overwhelms the wine. So, you can drink this now. Best After 2022 "
774,Matsu El Viejo,2020,Tempranillo,Spain,56,13.5,5.0,12,"Aromas of red plums, blueberries, cocoa beans, light spices and bark. Medium-bodied with fine, slightly chewy tannins, bright acidity and a velvety texture. Delicious and pretty, with ripe-fruit character and notes of spices to close. Vegan. Drink or hold. "
775,Faustino I Gran Reserva,2010,Tempranillo,Spain,39,13.5,4.1,31,"Very complex aromas of ripe berries, sultanas, cedar and hints of chocolate. Full-bodied with round, ripe tannins that are layered and fresh. A delicious combination of mature fruit and mahogany add to the complexity of the wine. Holding on really nicely. Drink or hold. This red carries dense aromas of plum, cassis and caramel, but is surprisingly bright on entry. It offers complex dark-fruit flavors up front that dissolve into notes of butterscotch, tobacco and dark chocolate. Plush tannins make their presence known right into the fruit-filled finish. Autumnal, bonfire character here: savoury, truffle, cinder toffee and dried black cherry. A classic yet rich and concentrated wine that perfectly expresses the year and region. Long on red-fruit clarity, this tastes like crushed strawberries and cranberries, with some deli-cate bitterness from the skin of the fruit. Its lacy flavors persist, a wine of grace and har-mony, tight and clean. This is not a block- buster 2010, but if you take it on its own terms, it is lovely to drink. COMMENTARY: The 2010 Faustino I Gran Reserva is complete with excellent length on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with coconut and black fruit aromas and flavors. Try it with grilled beef steak. (Tasted: October 25, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "

The slightly chewy finish is scored by tar and savory accents, giving this a bit of an old-school bent in the end. Best from 2023. "

779,Jean-Louis Chave Saint-Joseph,2019,Syrah/Shiraz,France,109,0,0.0,0,"Both Saint Josephs from Chave are brilliant, and the estate 2019 Saint Joseph offers classic blackberry fruits as well as peppery, violet, and smoky bacon fat. It has a ripe, concentrated style yet brings plenty of tannins and has a firm, age-worthy feel. A tasting of barrels samples of various lieux-dits: Les Dardouille, Le Clos, Les Challaix, Bachasson (both higher and lower sites). The overall impression is a rich, full vintage, but by no means excessive, jammy or baked. Each site expresses its particular character with aplomb, and there is plenty of high-toned precision to the aromas, ranging from the floral and spicy to the deeply fruited. The alcohol is marginally higher than in a typical year, but not unbalanced. J.L. Chave's Saint-Joseph is lively, vibrant and rich, fresher than most 2019s. Bottled in late July 2021, Chave's 2019 Saint Joseph boasts copious floral scents of violets and lavender set against a backdrop of purple raspberries. In the mouth, it's medium to full-bodied, with a wonderfully rich yet silky feel and plenty of airy, refreshing length on the finish. It should drink well on release and for at least a decade after that. "
780,Santa Margherita Sparkling,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,Italy,21,11.5,4.1,107,"COMMENTARY: The Santa Margherita Brut Rosé is lovely, zesty, and refreshing. TASTING NOTES: This wine is fresh and jazzy.

781,Carpano Antica Formula Sweet Vermouth (375ML,half-bottle),Vermouth,Italy,21,16.5,4.4,237,"This dark, mysterious vermouth is rich, complex and layered, boasting aromas of mint and other herbs, plums and figs, reminscent of Madeira. The rich flavors are hard to pin down: cocoa, red wine, almonds, bitter marmelade, hints of spice and toffee all play across the palate, finishing with a bracing bitter edge. This delectable sweet vermouth would shine in a Manhattan. "
782,The Walls Bellamy,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Washington,79,14.4,0.0,0,"Coming from the Rocks district of Walla Walla, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Bellamy is based on 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc, and the rest Malbec, all raised in 68% new French oak. It has a great nose of dark berry, almost blueberry-like fruits as well as ample tobacco leaf, damp earth, baking spices, and chocolaty oak. Rich, medium to full-bodied, and concentrated, it has velvety tannins, beautiful overall balance, and a great finish. It needs 2-4 years to integrate its oak (it's undeniably delicious today) and will have 15-20 years of longevity, if not longer. Best After 2024 The 2019 Bellamy is a delightful blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, with 7% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec. On the nose this takes on layers of bright dark fruits with chocolate and coffee ground accents. The palate is extremely elegant and refined, revealing layers of dark currants, kirsch and flinty undertones that mingle with good freshness and salinity. Glorious in its youth, this has another decade or more ahead of it. "
783,Santa Carolina Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,12,13.5,3.6,252,"A tight, focused red with fresh-plum and chocolate character. Medium body, firm and creamy tannins and a flavorful finish. Drinkable now, but better in 2022. Expansive cherry and plum aromas are clean, friendly and fluffy as they introduce a deep palate that's in fine shape. Flavors of cassis, wild berries and plum show backside spice, while this remains balanced and classy on the finish. "
784,Chateau Marquis d'Alesme,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,44,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2019 Château Marquis D'Alesme is terrific and a good follow-up to the brilliant 2018. Sporting a deep ruby/purple hue, it gives up a great nose of ripe darker cherries, blackberries, mulberries, leafy herbs, cedar pencil, and violets. This is followed by a medium to full-bodied Margaux with a rich, fleshy, expansive mouthfeel, polished tannins, plenty of mid-palate depth, and a great finish. I'm not sure it will make terribly old bones, but it shines for its purity of fruit as well as its terrific overall balance and purity. As I wrote from barrel, it's one of those pretty, elegant wines that still packs rocking levels of fruit! Drink it any time over the coming 15-20 years. Best After 2022 The 2019 Marquis d'Alesme has tuned out well, wafting from the glass with aromas of sweet berry fruit, wood smoke, licorice and sweet soil tones. Medium to full-bodied, ample and seamless, it's supple and charming, with a succulent core of fruit, powdery tannins and fine length. Best After 2025 "
785,Rodney Strong Symmetry Meritage,2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,63,14.5,0.0,0,"Based on 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Malbec, 12% Merlot, and the rest Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, the 2017 Symmetry has a darker fruited, pepper, herbal style offering nicely integrated oak and cedar notes, medium-bodied richness, some firmer tannins, and rock-solid overall balance. It shows lots of classic Sonoma Cabernet character and has loads to love. It too should keep for over a decade and will probably benefit from short-term cellaring. "
786,Artadi Vina el Pison,2010,Tempranillo,Spain,349,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2010 Vina El Pison, one of the first single-vineyard wines in Rioja, is sourced from the Tempranillo vines planted by Juan Carlos Lopez de Lacalle’s grandfather in 1945. The 2.4-hectare vineyard is located in Laguardia, very close to the winery, at 480 meters above sea level. The destemmed grapes ferment in open wooden vats and the wine ages for 15 months in French oak barrels. Ever-changing in the glass, it moves from one set of aromas when just opened to the next one in a matter of minutes, switching from cherries to violets, the cinnamon turns into nutmeg, then it is raspberries, and even blood oranges. The medium-bodied palate shows great precision, tension and purity of flavors, with clean acidity and a mineral core that make it vibrant. It’s not in-your-face, it whispers, and you have to pay attention. It has great balance and harmony. The tight tannins would benefit from a little bit more time in bottle, and I’m sure the wine will age for a very long time. This is a great, world-class wine. Drink 2015-2030. "
787,Evodia Old Vine Garnacha,2019,Grenache,Spain,14,14.5,3.7,330,"Based on 100% Garnacha, the 2019 Evodia is a killer value that delivers incredible Garnacha flair at a crazy good price. Kirsch, blackberry, acacia flower, violet, and sandalwood notes give way to a medium to full-bodied, seamless, beautifully layered wine with fabulous tannins, no hard edges, and a great, great finish.

Shows refined tension and beauty. Drink or hold. I find a very nicely crafted and harmonious wine in the 2018 Malbec Remolinos Vineyard, a red with a fruit-driven nose full of violets, berries, good freshness and elegance. The palate is very balanced and fresh with no edges. It is simply delicious. Offers dark cherry and plum flavors that are fleshy and filled with tannic power. Minerally midpalate, with a finish that is loaded with baker's chocolate accents. "
789,Chateau Canon (1.5 Liter Magnum),2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,369,14.5,0.0,0,"Blackberries and tar with wet-earth and dark-bark aromas. Dark-chocolate and brownie notes, too. It’s full-bodied with creamy tannins and a round, caressing finish. Lovely focus and intensity, though dense and layered. Extremely creamy and polished. Really precise and bespoke. It already opens beautifully on the palate. Drink after 2025. A beautiful Canon that performs the 360-degree trick in your mouth of expanding up, down and out. Of course a little austere right now at this young age, but already walking the tightrope towards richness; the creaminess in the texture becomes clear after 20 minutes in the glass. This has salinity, purity, precision and grip, showing its distinct personality and its ability to draw juice and mouthwatering expression from the fruits. Drinking Window 2026 - 2048 The Grand Vin is the 2018 Château Canon, which is based on 72% Merlot and 28% Cabernet Franc brought up in 52% new French oak. Its incredible bouquet delivers richness paired with amazing freshness and precision, offering loads of crème de cassis and darker berry fruits intermixed with classic Saint-Emilion chalky minerality, graphite, scorched earth, and spring flowers. Gorgeous on the palate as well, with medium to full-bodied richness, ultra-fine tannins, flawless balance, and again, this wonderful sense of freshness paired with ample richness, it needs 4-5 years of bottle age and will evolve for 30+ years. The 2009 and 2015 are still my favorite vintages of this wine, but this is up there with the best of them. Ripe and focused, with a core of plum, black cherry and raspberry compote notes that are still a bit coiled up, though inlaid with a racy chalky spine and notes of black tea and tobacco that should all meld as it stretches out in the cellar. A restrained, refined, lengthy wine that drips with class. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2024 through 2038. "
790,San Filippo Brunello di Montalcino Le Lucere,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,139,14.5,0.0,0,"Black cherry and berry aromas with some flowers, such as lavender, follow through to a full body with firm, racy tannins and a long, flavorful finish. The quality of the tannins is fantastic in this 2017. Drink after 2023. Le Lucére is a single vineyard of 3.5ha planted in 1996 below Salvioni and La Cerbaiona in Montalcino and producing about 13,000 bottles annually. Gentle fruit handling and a short maceration contribute to the graceful style of this Brunello. It ages in a combination of big oak casks and small barrels for a total of two years. What, in my opinion, could explain the exceptional freshness and the unwavering elegance of this Brunello is the eastern exposure of the vineyard on the northern side of the village. The dried cherry fruit is lifted with thyme and blood orange, a touch of wax and deep hints of smoky woodland. The palate is dense and velvety, with greatly refined tannins and predominantly floral flavours. Organic. There is a tension between the strawberry and cherry fruit flavors in this red, which has a savory side, evoking wild Mediterranean herbs, tobacco and eucalyptus flavors. Dense, burly tannins underline it all and the finish is long and satisfying. Best from 2025 "
791,Ar. Pe. Pe. Grumello Rocca de Piro Valtellina Superiore,2015,Nebbiolo,Italy,57,13.5,4.6,5,"Fruit for this wine comes from the high altitudes of the Rhaetian Alps, where decomposed granite soils make for a dark contrast against brilliant white ice and snow falls. The Ar. Pe. Pe. 2015 Valtellina Superiore Nebbiolo Grumello Rocca de Piro reveals a long succession of dried raspberry, cassis, pressed violets, iron ore and crushed stone. This wine promises to make a terrific pairing with a simple plate of thinly sliced Valtellina bresaola. An elegant light- to medium-bodied red, with fine tannins creating a supple frame for flavors wild strawberry, black tea leaf and a ferrous, minerally underpinning. It's fresh and focused, with a lingering, lightly spiced finish. Drink now through 2030. Initially shy, the subtle nose eventually reveals new leather, Alpine herb and wild berry. The savory palate has an understated elegance, offering Marasca cherry, pomegranate and graphite alongside refined tannins. Drink through 2027. "
792,St. Michael-Eppan Schulthauser Pinot Bianco,2020,Pinot Blanc,Italy,26,13.5,4.3,54,"White spring flower, ripe white stone fruit and Alpine herb aromas mingle with an inviting whiff of freshly kneaded bread dough on this stunning, polished white. It's dry, elegant and absolutely delicious, delivering creamy yellow apple, citrus, baking spice and tangy mineral alongside fresh acidity. Drink now through 2024. This smells of fresh spring greens, but on the generous palate there’s much more yellow fruit (mirabelle and nectarine) and vibrant freshness that leads you into the refreshing lemon and mineral finish. Drink now. "
793,Sine Qua Non The Duel Syrah,2008,Syrah/Shiraz,California,599,0,0.0,0,"A prodigious effort that possesses overflowing richness and depth, the 2008 Syrah The Duel (88% Syrah, 6% Grenache and 6% Viognier, all from the Eleven Confessions Vineyard) delivers an off-the-hook drinking experience with decadent cassis, blackberry, smoked meats, crushed flowers and hints of spice all soaring from the glass. A full-bodied, unctuous Syrah that stays fresh and elegant, with vibrant acidity, it needs a solid decant if drinking anytime soon and will see its 20th birthday in fine form. Drink now-2028. Pure, rich and deeply flavored, centered around ripe, restrained plum and blueberry flavors, with touches of spice, cedar, tobacco and crushed rock. Ends with a subtle, detailed aftertaste. Drink now through 2021. "
794,Domaine des Baumard Clos du Papillon Savennieres,2016,Chenin Blanc,France,54,13.5,0.0,0,"The Baumards own the eastern “wing” of the Clos du Papillon, a vineyard named for its butterfly shape planted on a south- and southeast-facing hillside overlooking the Loire. This wine layers savory button mushroom notes over a smoky meatiness. Its deep yellow flavors of pineapple energize the wine with freshness, a concentrated Savennières to serve with a creamy wild mushroom stew. "

797,Frescobaldi CastelGiocondo Brunello di Montalcino,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,79,0,4.4,15,"Black-cherry and blackberry aromas with minerals and fresh flowers, following through to a full body with firm, silky tannins that are polished and intense. Lovely finesse and length. Drink after 2023. The Frescobaldi 2016 Brunello di Montalcino CastelGiocondo shows dark fruit, plum and spice. The wine offers good density and richness, but the aromatic intensity is downplayed compared to some of its peers from this classic vintage. Other than that, all the wine's elements are in the right place with cherry, wild plum, rose and tilled earth. Production is an ample 300,000 bottles. Starts out with macerated plum and cherry fruit, shaded by tobacco, iron and earth flavors. Dense, dusty tannins put the grip on the finish, yet this is also vibrant and finds a nice equilibrium in the end, with the fruit returning. Best from 2024 through 2042. "
798,Domaine Taupenot-Merme Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru,2017,Pinot Noir,France,349,0,0.0,0,"Mid crimson with a lighter rim. Rather a stylish, elegant nose, pure poised and gracious, crushed raspberry style fruit, very persistent. A ripe coulis de framboise style of fruit but really pleasing. Bottled with a DIAM 30 organic closure. The 2017 Charmes-Chambertin Grand Cru has a primal bouquet of black cherry and crushed strawberry fruit, becoming more confit-like with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with sappy red berry fruit and fine depth and poise. Crisp and taut with a pleasant brittle texture toward the finish. It needs time, but it will come good in the end. Closure is Diam 30 Organic. Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2017 tasting. Best After 2025 Light reduction and wood blur the nuance of the red berry fruit and earth scents so I again would counsel a quick aeration. The sleek and seductively, indeed even silky, textured medium-bodied flavors are attractively refined thanks to the dense but finely grained tannins that give shape to the lingering and refreshing finish that offers slightly better depth.

801,Olivier Leflaive Pernand-Vergelesses,2019,Chardonnay,France,59,13,0.0,0,"Here’s a perfect example of how the white wines from certain “lesser” Burgundian appellations shine in the 2019 vintage. Medium-bodied and quite tightly wound, this is intensely chalky with excellent freshness, accentuated at the finish by just a touch of bitterness. Drink or hold. "
802,San Salvatore Falanghina,2021,Falanghina,Italy,29,14,3.8,10,"A light-bodied white, offering nectarine and clementine fruit flavors that are bright and juicy, with pretty cherry blossom, sliced almond and pickled ginger accents. Chalk-tinged finish. "

804,Copertino Riserva,2012,Negroamaro,Italy,16,0,3.4,18,"An intriguing red that's aging gracefully, with delicate notes of baked cherry and black fig fruit accented by dried thyme, incense and leather. Well-knit and focused, with light, silky tannins, this is still fresh thanks to its orange peel acidity and the tang of minerally iron and salt notes. Drink now through 2027. "
805,Pedro Parra Imaginador,2020,Cinsault,Chile,40,13.5,3.5,15,"The 2020 Cinsault Imaginador is a combination of grapes from five different vineyards in Guarilihue, fermented in open tanks in whole bunches and aged in concrete and ""foudres."" Cherry red in color. The nose presents aromas of damp earth, pomegranate and a hint of jam. Compelling and reductive on the palate, with fine-grained, compact tannins and grip. Bold, fruity flavors appear at the back of the mouth. "
806,Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,459,14,4.1,6,"This is a wonderful wine, it’s absolutely precise, finely wrought and gorgeously balanced between richness and elegance, with notes of damson, black cherry, slate and rosemary. Silky soft tannins highlight the concentration of the fruit and the grilled oak notes that are La Mission’s signature, with a fresh core that stretches out the palate. A low pH gives tension through the palate, and is highly seductive. No Cabernet Franc this year. The 2016 La Mission Haut-Brion checks in as a Merlot-heavy blend, 57.5% Merlot and 42.5% Cabernet Sauvignon. About as pure and seamless (yet sexy) as they come in the vintage, it offers awesome notes of dried flowers, sweet currants, cedarwood, forest floor, and exotic spices. With a flawless texture, medium to full body, and ultra-fine tannins, this beauty builds incrementally on the palate with terrific mid-palate depth and a stunning finish. It’s sexier and more charming compared to the more backward Haut Brion, yet I suspect it will age just as long. Regal wine, showing alluringly ripe and dark plums, that carries a wealth of complexity in its DNA - fine spices, leaves, graphite, violets and more. The palate has very precise drive and super focused style and delivers authoritative tannins that are arranged in linear fashion. Power with elegance. Try from 2024. This is super vivid, offering cassis, blackberry, raspberry and blueberry compote flavors that bristle with energy while a mouthwatering frame of anise and apple wood adds electric energy. This is borderline rambunctious but it's bridled well enough and when the fruit and wood sides mesh fully, this will be a rock star. Best from 2025 through 2040. "
807,Esprit de Pavie,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,21,14.5,3.6,58,"A juicy and rich red with blackberry and black-truffle aromas and flavors. Layered and beautifully toned. Full-bodied, round and juicy. Beautiful wine. Really well done. Drink or hold. This vintage is a blend of 65% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Franc and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and was aged for 15 months in one-year-old barrels. Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2015 Esprit de Pavie (a blend of vines in Côtes do Castillon and young vines from Pavie and Monbousquet) opens with expressive red and black plums notes plus touches of baking spices, vanilla pod, dark chocolate and dried Provence herbs. Medium to full-bodied, the bright fruit fills the mouth with plenty of spicy red and black fruits, supported by chewy tannins and finishing with a refreshing lift. "
808,Long Meadow Ranch Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,California,25,13,4.4,7,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Long Meadow Ranch Rutherford Sauvignon Blanc is bright and lively, with an excellent presence on the palate.

809,Feudo Montoni Lagnusa Nero d'Avola,2019,Nero d'Avola,Italy,22,13.5,4.1,24,"Fabio Sireci culls fruit for this wine from 35-year-old vines propagated from his ancient Vrucara plot. He ages it primarily in cement tanks, accentuating the aromas of pink petals, balsamic herbs and fresh raspberries. Those fresh red-berry and wild-herb flavors create a bold and buoyant expression of nero d’Avola that reflects Sireci’s wind-blown, high-elevation vineyards in central Sicily. Heady aromas of ripe black-skinned berry, blue flower and Mediterranean scrub are front and center on this smooth red. Made with organically grown grapes, it's delicious and accessible, featuring blackberry jam, ripe black cherry, star anise and baking spice alongside supple tannins. Fresh acidity keeps it balanced. Drink through 2026. The organic Feudo Montoni 2019 Sicilia Nero d'Avola Lagnusa is named after the Sicilian word for ""lazy"" because of the low yields associated with this particular growing site with heavy clay soils. Smooth and silky, the wine gives us a very accurate portrayal of the grape, with plenty of ripe, dark and purple fruits followed by scorched earth, toasted almond and a hint of black olive. Nero d'Avola sometimes renders smoky tar or resin, and you can sense that here. Some 98,000 bottles were made. Enjoy this excellent value wine with a pulled-pork barbecue sandwich. "

An equal blend of Merlot and Sangiovese, this is a beautifully rich and determined wine with sharply delineated black fruit that veers towards Japanese plum, blackberry, spice and cured leather. Both grapes are persuaded to show their most elegant and soulful side in this classic vintage. Hints of cedar, balsamic, citrus and red cherry on the nose. Medium-to full-bodied with firm, chewy tannins that are fresh and vivid. Tight and reserved, but exciting at the same time. A wine made by Avignonesi and Capanelle. "
812,Pyramid Valley Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,Zealand,49,13.5,4.4,5,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 Pyramid Valley Appellation Series Pinot Noir is an outstanding effort showing excellent purity. TASTING NOTES: This wine is wonderfully bright with aromas and flavors of vivid red fruit, savory spices, and light chalky notes. Serve it with grilled salmon fillets. (Tasted: March 8, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Only the second release of this Otago wine after Pyramid Valley’s shift in ownership, and it’s already showing great promise. It’s lightweight but not without substance or layers. Gentle berry notes mingle with savory, mushroom and soy sauce nuances. It really comes to life on the palate, which is both vivacious and structured, the chalky tannins and crunchy acidity jiving with juicy, silky fruit. Elegant, poised and highly drinkable. Drink now and over the next five to eight years.  Intense and succulent cherry, blood orange and cranberry flavors are fresh and refreshing, with details of cigar, clay, clove and cedar, gaining momentum on the finish. Drink now through 2030. This has attractive violet and rose florals and a wealth of cedary and spicy oak weighing in. The palate has a fine-cut tannin texture that drives savory and tangy at the finish. Showing touches of cola and mocha from its oak aging, the 2018 Central Otago Pinot Noir also comes from a warmer vintage, so it is a slightly bigger, more powerful wine than the 2017 or 2019 versions. Ripe cherries are underscored by entwined herbal tendrils in this medium to full-bodied effort, framed by gently dusty tannins and a long, silky-textured finish. "
813,Billecart-Salmon Brut Sous,Bois,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,89,12,4.3,32,"COMMENTARY: The Billecart-Salmon Sous Bois is one of the best non-vintage Bruts in the marketplace. TASTING NOTES: This Champagne is rich and racy. Its lively aromas and flavors of mineral notes and bright stone fruits should pair superbly with oven-roast chicken over a mix of arugula and kale. The complex bouquet reflects the primary fermentation in oak casks; the palate no less so thanks to the quality of the premier and grand cru reserves, also matured in oak. But it’s all a question of degree; there’s a core of citrussy acidity underwriting the freshness and length of the wine. 7 years on lees; disgorged December ’20, 7g/l dosage. Fermented in wood with a touch of spice and toast on the palate, this Champagne is beautifully textured and structured. The Chardonnay gives the wine a steely edge that suggests the bottling could age, so wait to drink this very fine wine from 2023. A dense Champagne with a tight and linear structure. Compressed and very pretty. Hints of nuts and cream with some pie crust. Some nougat, too. Very long and flavorful. It’s one for a meal. One third of pinot meunier, pinot noir and chardonnay. Fermented and aged in barrel for about six months. Disgorged July 19, 2020. It’s aged six years on lees. Drink or hold. The NV Champagne Sous Bois Brut pours a medium yellow to deeper straw hue, and the nose is warming and more generous with notes of toast, red fruit of ripe raspberry, spice, and espresso. The palate is rounded, with rich texture though dry, offering notes of orange peel and currant. It has a silky texture and a fairly long finish, with ripe concentration. It is drinking well now and should drink well. Best after 2022. Flavors of baked pineapple, chopped black cherry, grilled nut and pickled ginger expand on the palate of this expressive Champagne backed by a firm spine of integrated acidity. Fine like raw silk on the palate, and the lightly mouthwatering finish carries accents of lime blossom, chalk and oyster shell. Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay. Drink now "
814,Michel Gassier Costieres de Nimes Nostre Pais White,2019,Rhone White Blends,France,25,14.5,4.0,13,"Notably richer and deeper, the 2019 Costières de Nîmes Nostre Païs Blanc reveals a vivid gold color as well as a honeyed nose of tangerine, apricot, peach, and white flowers. With medium to full-bodied richness, a beautifully balanced, elegant texture, and a solid spine of acidity, this is another terrific white from this team that has loads to love. Bright yellow-plum and pear flavors are leesy and silken on the palate of this full-bodied yet fresh blend of Grenache Blanc (53%), Clairette (22%) and Viognier (11%). It's a pure-fruited dry white anchored by crisp lemon acidity and a finish dusted with hints of white pepper and nutmeg. At peak now, the wine is likely to hold through 2025 Inviting, with a shortbread note leading off, followed by verbena, white peach and star fruit flavors. Offers a caressing feel along with good brightness and zip. Tasty. Grenache Blanc, Clairette, Viognier and Roussanne. "

It is produced from 50% Narvaux Dessous, 30% Gorge de Narvaux and 20% Chaume de Narvaux; each picked separately, with Dessous being the first and Chaume last as it is the coldest. This has an enchanting nose of ginger, white pepper and wood spice, while there is plenty of extract here and a powerful structure. A marvellous wine for its level. Aromatic and well-defined, this white reveals lemon and apple flavors, with flourishes of vanilla and baking spice. Though vibrant and precise, this has a harmonious, elegant feel, too. Nutty finish.  "
817,Tenuta degli Dei Le Redini,2019,Other Red Blends,Italy,40,13.5,0.0,0,"This is very complex on the nose with incense, Indian spices, blackberries and blueberries. Medium-to full-bodied with fine, velvety tannins that lead you down the palate. Solid at the end. Try after 2023. The 2019 Le Redini is another fabulous wine in this lineup. A blend of Merlot and Alicante, Le Redini impresses with its energy and vibrancy. Plum, mocha, gravel, spice and licorice are all beautifully delineated. In 2019, Le Redini has an extra kick of energy that is just compelling. It's a wine of extreme pleasure. "
818,Hacienda Monasterio Ribera del Duero,2018,Tempranillo,Spain,51,0,4.6,8,"The 2018 Hacienda Monasterio, the wine that was previously labeled as Crianza, is a blend of 80% Tinto Fino, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot and 2% Malbec selected from the 100 hectares of their organically certified vineyard in the west part of Ribera del Duero. It had a traditional fermentation, destemmed and in 8,000-liter stainless steel tanks (a change from the 20,000-liter vats used in 2016) with indigenous yeasts, and it matured for 18 months in French oak barrels, 25% new. This wine represents the character of the property, including all the grapes. It's still a little young, with a creamy twist, a little biscuity with hints of cereals, juicy and with tannins but with balance. This is a vintage that has great balance and freshness, but right now it's a little too oaky for me—but it should develop nicely in bottle. They are now in the process of replacing the Merlot with Malbec, because they think Malbec can work well in the Ribera del Duero. "

Full-bodied with very fine, firm and silky tannins and lots of long, focused fruit and spice flavor.  The 2018 Barolo opens to ripe aromas of dried plum and tobacco. This vintage lacks some of the complexity of a cooler growing season, but these results are far from monochromatic. Those tobacco aromas cede to cedar, earth, forest floor and hints of shaved truffle. The new selection 'Pio' from Pio Cesare is a blend of the different MGAs of the estate. Classic bright garnet in the glass, the wine is focused on cherry kernels with tar, violet, a bit of camphor and sweet spices. The attack is firm and crisp, introducing a brilliant crunchiness on the palate along with grainy tannins which stretch to a slightly austere finish. It lacks a bit of pulp - a signature of the 2018 vintage - but this is one of the best village-level Barolo this year. Underbrush, hazelnut and new leather aromas come to the forefront along with a whiff of eucalyptus. Linear and already accessible, the palate offers toasted nut, dried cherry and licorice before a coffee close. Polished, refined tannins provide support. "

It feels substantive from the get-go, its core of dark flavor distant at first, slowly coming into focus along its structured length. With air, stemmy savor gives complexity to the cherry notes. The wine is airy and open, though, a faint sweetness making it all the more quaffable—that expansiveness brought my mind to a pâtisserie window, electric-red macerated berries perched atop puffy layers of pastry dough.

Delicate mineral tones turn the wine over to more nuanced flavors and long-lasting intensity. Soft spice adds to the wine's broad and open texture. Best After 2022 "
833,PlumpJack Merlot,2019,Merlot,California,79,15,0.0,0,"A beautiful Merlot, the 2019 from PlumpJack offers everything you could want from this variety with its plump, fleshy, medium to full-bodied profile as well as terrific aromatics of black cherries, darker berries, leafy herbs, spring flowers, and a touch of chocolate. It’s ready to go yet should continue delivering the goods over the coming decade. The 2019 Merlot is a blend of 97% Merlot and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon. Deep garnet-purple in color, it opens with herbal wafts over a core of stewed plums and boysenberries, with hints of charcoal, licorice and potpourri. The medium to full-bodied palate is plush and juicy with bags of black fruit flavors and an aniseed kick on the finish. "
834,Castello di Querceto Chianti Classico,2020,Sangiovese,Italy,16,13,0.0,0,"Black cherries and lemons on the nose. Honeysuckle, too. It’s medium-bodied with firm, chewy tannins and a fresh finish. A little hard now, but should soften with time. Give it a year or two in the bottle. Try in 2024. "
835,Secret Door JML Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,64,14.4,0.0,0,"This is an aromatic red with an array of blueberries and black cherries, as well as some blue flowers and fresh herbs. Has an elegant touch of Asian spices and sweet vanilla. Full body. Ripe, fine-grained tannins and a firm texture with delicious fruit and bright acidity. Succulent, mineral finish. Drink or hold. "
836,Chateau Lynch-Bages,2009,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,244,13.5,4.8,15,"Tight and backward, this has dense, almost chewy layers of fig, currant and plum cake behind a very solid wall of cedar, roasted vanilla and charcoal notes. There's serious grip on the finish, with an iron edge that won't quit. Best from 2015 through 2035. The medium to deep garnet colored 2009 Lynch Bages is boldly scented of crème de cassis, blackberry pie and baked plums with chocolate box, incense and underbrush suggestions plus a waft of bay leaves. Medium to full-bodied, taut and well sustained in the mouth, it has a firm, grainy texture and a lively backbone lifting the black fruit core to a nice long finish. A powerful and ripe wine with a wide-screen personality, this makes a very bold statement without becoming a jot heavy. Serious tannins at the long finish suggest this has long-term aging potential. Drink now with a big steak or hold. This is a little more subdued than some right now, needing a good five minutes in the glass before revealing layers of rich olive, cassis, exotic spices, cracked pepper and garrigue. You get the heat of the vintage and the ripeness of the fruit, balanced by muscular, chewy tannins and gorgeous chocolate notes. This is great, although for me the 2010 just pips it. "
837,Viticcio Chianti Classico Riserva,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,40,14,0.0,0,"Supple and vibrant, yet concentrated, featuring black cherry, blackberry, violet, mineral and tobacco aromas and flavors.

839,Ramos Pinto 30 Year,Tawny,Port,Portugal,129,19.9,4.5,23,"The wonderful old-gold color of this tawny leads into a generous, rich wine that has retained fruits while also showing a woody character that is typical of wines this old. With spice, dried raisins and intense acidity, it is a beautiful wine that deserves to be drunk just by itself. The Ramos Pinto 30 Year Tawny Porto is all about the complexity. It just wraps its nuances of butterscotch, vanilla, hazelnut, and sweet oak onto the palate and then some. The some, in this case, is just a long, long finish that never seems to stop. Enjoy this sweet nectar with a long conversation with a good friend. (Tasted: October 27, 2016, San Francisco, CA) This sings from the glass with sweet spice, marmalade, molasses, clove, nutty, toffee, caramel and balsamic perfume. A very complex array of flavors, including roasted coffee, scorched earth, fig and walnut. A distinctive style, done very well. Highly impressive. This is alluring, with whiffs of warm date, green tea and walnut backed by juicy fig bread and salted caramel flavors. The racy, focused finish lets a singed juniper note glide through. Drink now. The NV RP 30 Year Old Tawny Port was bottled in February 2020 with a bar-top cork and 139 grams of residual sugar. Showing more complexity and notably more sweetness than the 20 Year also reviewed this issue, this is along the lines of the last release (the 2018) that I saw a while back. As it opens and the sugar blows off, especially a couple of days later, this shows off its complexity even more, but also just a touch of harshness. The key difference is really the complexity versus the freshness—in other words, about what you'd expect. The 20 Year has almost as much concentration and power as this elegant 30 Year, but the 20 Year is fresher and even more elegant (not that the 30 isn't rather fresh for its age), while the 30 Year is far more nuanced. I personally slightly preferred this, as I usually lean toward complexity, but reasonable minds might differ. “This starts with a crescendo and doesn’t stop,” said Justin Nash of NYC’s The Modern. It’s a broad-spectrum Tawny, the pleasures of its textures rolling out across the mouth and throat, the flavors delivered in layers of toasty, nutty complexity. It’s the kind of wine that will inspire conversation long into the night. "
840,Chateau Dalem,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,26,15,3.8,16,"Readers looking for a smoking deal in the vintage should grab bottles of the 2019 Château Dalem. This rich, medium to full-bodied, mouth-filling effort has lots of ripe darker cherry and blackberry fruit as well as tobacco, cedar pencil, and violet nuances. Rich, textured, balanced, and with a real sense of purity and class, it's ideal for enjoying over the coming 10-12, if not 15 years or so. Best after 2022.  Sleek and taut, with chalky threads running along the edges of a core of fresh cherry puree and cassis notes. Features a subtle tobacco accent throughout, with nice cut through the finish. Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now. "
841,Sine Qua Non Patine Syrah,2011,Syrah/Shiraz,California,499,0,0.0,0,"A wine that needs to be forgotten in the cellar for 5-6 years, the 2011 Syrah Patine checks in as a blend of roughly 97% Syrah and the balance Roussanne and Viognier. It too comes all from the estate's Eleven Confessions Vineyard and saw 39 months in 63% new French oak. Backward, tight, concentrated and structured, with full-bodied richness and depth, it gives up Guigal La Landonne like aromas and flavors of graphite, sweet oak, smoked meats, pepper and black raspberry and cassis-like fruit. While it shows the vintage's cooler nature, it has a stacked mid-palate and will evolve gracefully for 15-20 years. "
842,Wrath Pommard 4/777 Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,29,14.4,3.7,16,"Rust and iron aromas kick off the nose of this bottling, followed by waves of pomegranate jam and rocky earth. The palate is sharp in raspberry, pomegranate and orange rind flavors that enliven the mouth, as hints of dried salami and earth add nuance. Well-structured and minerally, with notes of iodine to the dried berry and cherry flavors that show saline hints. Ends with dried sage accents on the firm finish. "

844,Abbazia di Novacella Kerner,2021,Other White Wine,Italy,24,0,4.1,26,"Made only in stainless steel, the 2021 Alto Adige Valle Isarco Kerner shows hints of mature fruit with lemon zest, soft kiwi and beeswax. The wine remains true to the variety with fresh fruit and minty lemon that will evolve in time. However, this edition doesn't quite have the same pop or crunch that we saw in previous editions. Production is 16,500 bottles, and fruit comes from the Conca di Bressanone area with high-elevation vines at 650 to 800 meters above sea level. "
845,Terra d'Oro Zinfandel,Port,Port,California,25,19,4.2,264,"The first duty of a Port-style wine is to be dazzlingly rich and sweet, yet balanced in acidity, and this bottling is all that. Waves of blackberry jam, cassis, and dark chocolate are brightened with zesty acidity and the sweetness level is very high. Is Port service the ending or just the beginning? Traditionally, Port is served at the end of the meal with blue veined cheeses and/or cigars. Guests often find this to be a fitting capper of a well-orchestrated evening. But for some, this is a time of discussion and reflection—perhaps the evening hasn't ended after all? The Terra d'Oro Zinfandel Port exhibits ripe berries and raisin notes. The wine's sweetness make a beautiful pairing with an aged double crème blue veined cheese. Drinks well now. (Tasted: July 19, 2016, San Francisco, CA) "
846,Hahn SLH Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,30,14.5,3.8,112,This is a strong showing for a large production Pinot Noir. Mesquite-smoked cherry and light cola aromas on the nose cruise into a spicy palate of root beer and cinnamon that surrounds a cherry compote core. Editors’ Choice

848,Zonin,Prosecco,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Italy,15,11,3.9,553,"Pretty green apples, lemons and limes. Lots of frothy bubbles are a fun accompaniment to the sliced citrus fruit available on the medium-bodied palate. "
849,Chateau LaTour-Martillac,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,42,14.1,4.2,54,"Solid tannins mark this still very young wine. At the same time, the fruit is rich and well proportioned. Black currants dominate the fruity spectrum, giving the wine richness as well as great potential. Drink from 2025. Some handy depth here. Ripe dark cherries and blackberries are framed in slightly nutty, cedary and spicy oak. The palate’s built on polished layered tannin sheets, delivering depth and sturdiness amid fresh flavors of dark cherries and cassis. Best from 2022. Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the 2015 Latour Martillac has a spicy nose of cinnamon stick, cloves and aniseed with a core of red and black cherries and a waft of fragrant earth. The palate is medium-bodied with plenty of juicy fruit and a firm frame of fine-grained tannins with bags of freshness lifting the finish. Silky, sexy, rich damson fruits aged in 30% new oak. A beautiful example of this wine: very strong in an already good vintage. Tannins grip the fruit without strangling; plenty of development potential. "
850,Bosquet des Papes Chateauneuf-du-Pape Cuvee Chante Le Merle,2018,Rhone Red Blends,France,85,0,0.0,0,"The perfumed, floral, cherry herbal tea-scented 2018 Chateauneuf du Pape Chante le Merle Vieilles Vignes isn't overly dark or dense, but captures the more fragrant, silky side of Grenache. It's full-bodied and ripe, with some faint, chocolaty overtones yet retains a sense of elegance and—dare I say it, in a wine that's labeled 15.5% alcohol—delicacy, finishing with silky tannins and ample length. It's a blend of 85% Grenache and 15% Mourvèdre, aged in foudres. Saturated ruby. Smoke- and spice-accented cherry, dark berry and lavender scents show fine clarity, and licorice and rhubarb accents emerge with aeration. Gently sweet and expansive in the mouth, offering appealingly sweet black raspberry, cherry preserve and floral pastille flavors that firm up through the mid palate. Subtly gripping tannins come in late on the impressively long finish, which strongly echoes the spice and floral notes.  In the same mold, the 2018 Châteauneuf Du Pape Chante Le Merle Vieilles Vignes offers loads of Provençal garrigue, smoked game, ground pepper, and traditional Châteauneuf du Pape goodness on the nose. It displays the vintage’s more forward, soft, supple style on the palate and is medium to full-bodied, with ripe tannins, moderate mid-palate depth, and a great finish. Based on 85% Grenache, 10% Mourvèdre, and 5% Syrah that was not destemmed and was brought up all in concrete, this is a classic Châteauneuf du Pape to enjoy over the coming 10-15 years. "
851,Decoy Limited Napa Valley Red,2018,Other Red Blends,California,29,14.5,4.0,94,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 Decoy ""Blue Label"" Limited Red Wine shows that well-conceived, red blends are often greater than the sum of their parts.

852,PlumpJack Oakville Estate Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,159,0,0.0,0,"The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Estate is a blend of 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 6% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec. Deep garnet-purple in color, it charges out of the gate with bold blackcurrant and blackberry preserves scents, plus hints of tilled soil, truffles and unsmoked cigars. The full-on opulent, rich, velvety palate is decadently laden with black fruit preserves and earthy accents, finishing long with a lively lift. "
853,Chateau Lilian Ladouys,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,27,13.6,4.2,50,"The blueberry and blackberry aromas are certainly attractive here. Full-bodied and dense with a very velvety texture and a long, generous finish of ripe fruit and spice. Drink from 2022. The nose reflects very ripe red and black fruit, and even some exotic notes, which could take some by surprise. But the palate is more balanced, showing fresh cassis on the finish, which has a long lift, and almost suggests the grapefruit freshness of a white wine! I like the mid-palate sap. An excellent wine and miles better than its New World-style and less terroir-driven 2010, also tasted. Drinking Window 2020 - 2030 A perennial overachiever, the 2016 Château Lilian Ladouys brings the goods in 2016 and has a complex, medium to full-bodied, character-filled style to go with loads of blue fruits, incense, dried herbs, and a hint of violets. A blend of 62% Merlot, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 6% Petit Verdot all raised in 30% new barrels, this charming, front end-loaded effort is well worth seeking out. It should keep for 10-15 years. Now under the same ownership as vastly improved Château Pedesclaux in Pauillac, this estate is also on the upward quality curve. This wine has the structure and tannins of a classic Saint-Estèphe as well as juicy, rich black fruits. With aging potential, the wine should be ready to drink from 2024. Very lively, featuring a fun mix of cassis, plum paste and cherry preserve flavors, framed with floral and mineral notes. The light-handed toast lets the fruit shine through the finish, with persistent chalky minerality. Best from 2021 through 2031. The 2016 Lilian Ladouys is a blend of 62% Merlot, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Petit Verdot aged in 30% new French oak for 15 months. Medium to deep garnet-purple in color, it sings of baked plums, crème de cassis and Black Forest cake with bay leaves, pencil lead and menthol. Medium-bodied, elegant and packed with vibrant flavor layers, it finishes long. "
854,Ziobaffa Organic Pinot Grigio,2021,Pinot Gris/Grigio,Italy,13,12,4.6,56,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Ziobaffa Organic Pinot Grigio is appealing and offers excellent weight on the palate.

855,Dal Forno Romano Passito Vigna Sere (375ML half-bottle),2004,Other Dessert,Italy,209,0,0.0,0,"The 2004 Passito Rosso Vino Dolce Vigna Seré (500-mililiter) is a masterpiece that is impossible to repeat. In fact, the wine has not been produced since 2004. Even if a vintage as good as this did come along, we'd need to wait another 13 years before we could enjoy this level of maturity and evolution. Formally a Recioto della Valpolicella, this sweet red wine is made with air-dried fruit as local tradition dictates. Luckily no botrytis set in that year, because that would have eroded the wine's deep and luscious color saturation. The bouquet delivers a generous flow of dark spice, bitter chocolate, espresso, raisin, plum, barbecue spice and teriyaki smoke. The concentration and layering of the wine are both rare and distinctive. The mouthfeel sees sweet flavors with a syrupy mouthfeel. The finish offers hints of caramelized brown sugar and savory hickory. The aging window is impossible to predict, but the wine is surely built to last. I can think of no other wine that comes close to matching this unique style. "
856,Beaulieu Vineyard Carneros Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,California,24,14.5,4.2,6,"Dried apple and pineapple with hints of coconut, steel and some flint. Full-bodied and tight with intensity and power. This will open nicely with bottle age. Try after 2022. With 17% Viognier, this white is steely, linear and flinty, with full-bodied ripeness beneath the focus. Layers of pear, apple and nutmeg ride along a lengthy foundation of unctuous lushness and approachability. "
857,Antica Mountain Select Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,70,0,4.0,32,"This shows plenty of blackcurrant and dark-chocolate character with ash and stone undertones.

858,Cantine Maschio Prosecco,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Italy,18,11,3.8,304,"Riunite’s entry into the Prosecco game offers an edgy, fresh peach and peppercorn-scented sparkler. It’s bright with the greenness of chlorophyll and a peppery burst in the end. Delicious with prosciutto. "
859,Domaine de l'Arlot Nuits Saint Georges Clos des Forets Saint Georges Premier Cru,2012,Pinot Noir,France,229,0,0.0,0,"A distinctly cool nose of purple fruit, earth and a hint of the sauvage leads to powerful, intense yet not really rustic medium weight flavors where the shaping tannins are unusually fine grained, all wrapped in a robust and tautly muscular finish. While this has not completely shed its typical Nuits character, the 2012 version is certainly more polished than usual. In sum, this is really quite good and worth your attention. Not too deep a colour, the oak slightly taking the upper hand, though the fine qualities of Forets fruit are trying to show through. I don’t remember how much whole bunch was used in 2012, Jacques Devauges’ second vintage here, and the otherwise thorough fact sheet on the domaine’s website does not specify, but there is certainly some. A little dry at the finish with some acidity. "
860,Louis Latour Chambertin Cuvee Heritiers Grand Cru,2012,Pinot Noir,France,309,13.5,0.0,0,"Aged in 100% new wood, this massive wine is full of dark plum and fragrant strawberries. It is also packed with dark tannins that give the wine a dry core. The fruitiness has a strongly juicy character, fragrant with acidity and freshness. The end is a reminder that this is a powerful wine. Drink from 2020. An intense, minerally style, lean and racy, with cherry, raspberry, tobacco and kirsch flavors. Saturated, tannic and balanced, with a long, palate-staining finish. Best from 2020 through 2035. 95 cases made. A spicy, cool and airy nose only grudgingly displays its complex array of ripe violet, plum, earth and wet stone scents. The velvet-textured and mineral-driven middle weight flavors possess excellent delineation as well as focused power before culminating in a balanced, complex and palate coating finish. The supporting tannins have a very good level of phenolic maturity and overall this is a very fine Latour Chambertin. "
861,Chateau Rieussec Sauternes,2019,Other Dessert,France,119,14,0.0,0,"The 2019 Rieussec is absolutely gorgeous. Gracious and supremely elegant in feel, the 2019 is immediately impressive. An exotic melange of lemon confit, marzipan, white flowers, passionfruit and tangerine oil opens effortlessly. The 2019 is compelling from start to finish. Harvest took place from October 8 to 15, in three passes. The 2019 is the first vintage that will be offered in a stylish new bottle. It is no secret Sauternes has struggled of late. I must say I really liked the new and very modern presentation, which shows a more playful side of Sauternes that might just work in creating a bit more excitement around these wines. This is the 2019, because Rieussec is no longer showing En Primeur but instead when it is in bottle. Marmalade and bitter orange peel is totally gorgeous, and this is one of the best Rieussec's that I can remember. A ton of juicy minerality, not overly concentrated but full of fresh pineapple and white mango, white peach and pear. 120g/l residual sugar. A brilliant Rieussec with so much personality and a full, rich texture through the mid palate. This is so delicious, with a medium body with medium sweetness. Dried mango and pineapple, as well as some vanilla. Bright and fresh. Lighter than some years. Yummy. Tarte-tartin. Love the new bottle. Drink and enjoy. "
862,Chateau Marsau,2019,Merlot,France,24,0,3.7,23,"The aromas of orange peel, citrus, fresh mushroom, bark, smoked meat and currants is fantastic.

864,Chateau Pontet-Canet (1.5 Liter Magnum),2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,299,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2018 Pontet-Canet is a blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. It was aged in 55% oak barriques and 45% amphorae. Deep garnet-purple colored, it explodes from the glass with an atomic perfume of raspberry pie, blackcurrant pastilles, rose oil and Chinese five spice, giving way to suggestions of cinnamon stick, dusty soil, pencil lead and underbrush. The rich, seductive, full-bodied palate is a hedonist's dream, delivering layer-upon-layer of black and red berry preserves with loads of fragrant accents, a beautifully firm yet plush texture and tons of freshness, finishing long with a whole firework display of exotic spices. This is pretty much out-of-the-gate delicious, but it has the backbone to evolve over three decades or more. This wine combines the richness of the vintage with a sophisticated structure of smoky tannins and spicy wood aging. It is still young, with a powerful structure and ripe, vibrant black-currant fruits. The wine needs plenty of aging. Drink from 2028. Organic and biodynamic A complex nose of blueberries, elderberries, dried fruit, spice and dark chocolate. It’s full-bodied with a harmonious, balanced texture. The tannins are still firm and powerful, but there’s balance and finesse to the whole thing. Tight and reserved, yet long and energetic. The tannins open slowly. Dusty texture. From biodynamically grown grapes. Try after 2024. In the glass you get a richly nuanced and aromatic glass of Pontet. Plum, gooseberry, cassis, rosemary, violet, tobacco leaf, sage and white pepper. Clear freshness, with beautiful floral aromatics through the palate - peony alongside the deeply textured fruit. A touch of bitterness on the finish and in the final moments the tannic grip of Pauillac takes hold. Has its own character and it feels very much of itself. Extremely small yields in this year, in which mildew meant they lost two-thirds of the crop. 55% new oak, 45% amphorae. Drinking Window 2027 - 2042 "

Dusty potpourri, incense, dried apricots and ripe apple notes create an alluring display. It’s smooth and pliant, but with a stunning mix of zesty acids and minerals which add tension, as tart orchard fruits evolve toward the close. There’s a good amount of weight and concentration here, which leads me to believe that a year or two in the cellar may bring even further depth, as this finishes long with pretty inner florals. (Lot 20005) The aromas of ripe apples and perfumed minerals combine to give a delicious note of freshly sliced banana, spruced up by a fresh, creamy-mineral fizz and a persistent, minerally finish. Excellent Prosecco with some complexity. Enjoy now. "

Its dense purple color is followed by a profound wine loaded with notions of crème de cassis, lead pencil shavings, melon, crushed stone, tobacco, and violets. Full-bodied, concentrated, and massive on the palate, yet also incredibly well delineated and precise, it has a wonderful mix of seemingly ripe, sunny fruit from a warm year yet the minerality, purity, and precision of a cooler year. This wine is going to be just about immortal; however, do your best to hide bottles for a solid 10-15 years. An elegant, complex nose of blackberries, blueberries and herbal and spice notes with dark-chocolate and earthy undertones. Violets, flowers and graphite, too. It’s full-bodied with firm, layered tannins and a crushed-stone undertone throughout the fresh, velvety and layered palate. Very complex, muscular and formed. The finish is endless. Lowest percentage of press wine ever in this. So deep. Try after 2027. This has such a textured, ripe, plump and poised black fruit character that is clear from the aromatics alone. Mouthfilling with huge texture and density, full of licorice root, black chocolate shavings and cocoa pod with crème de cassis edging. This is delicious and has chewy tannins that you can pick up with a shovel. One of the 'wines of the vintage'. Only 2% of press wine (unusually low, as it can go up to 15% in some years). It grips on tight to the finish - extremely impressive. 90% new oak. Drinking Window 2028 - 2050 The 2018 Léoville Las Cases is composed of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, harvested September 15 to October 4 with yields of 35.5 hectoliters per hectare, it has 14.49% alcohol and was aged in 90% new barriques. Deep purple-black colored, it needs a fair bit of coaxing to reveal striking scents of blackcurrant pastilles, wild blueberries and redcurrant jelly, giving way to notions of crushed rocks, lavender, Indian spices, unsmoked cigars and black truffles, plus a provocative waft of rose oil. The full-bodied palate is densely laden with black fruit preserves and earthy layers, accented by bright, lively red berry and floral sparks. It has a rock-solid frame of firm, ripe, grainy tannin's and bold freshness, finishing very long and wonderfully minerally. The tannin's are so beautifully approachable even at this youthful stage, making it delicious to drink now, but afford it 5-6 years in bottle to allow those finer nuances to emerge and drink it over the next 40+ years. Layered with dry tannins and concentrated texture, this major wine offers an impressive structure and promises considerable aging. Black-currant fruits are still tied to the tannins. The wine exudes richness and a classic profile. To say this wine will age is an understatement. Do not touch before 2028 at the earliest. Reserved, even reticent, at first, but like a cold fireplace brought back to life it slowly reveals beautifully handcrafted notes of cassis, plum reduction and blackberry puree along with hints of charcoal, warm cast iron and sweet bay leaf. A violet note chimes on the seriously long finish, adding a tantalizing treble note. A precise, regal, terroir-driven wine. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2028 through 2042. "
874,Gaja Sori San Lorenzo (1.5 Liter Magnum),2009,Nebbiolo,Italy,789,14.5,0.0,0,"Gaja's 2009 Sori San Lorenzo, on the other hand, is much more typical in its expression. Layers of juicy dark cherries, menthol, spices, tar, licorice and graphite flow across the palate as this powerful, masculine wine opens up in the glass. Balsamic infused aromas and flavors develop in the glass, adding considerable complexity and the signature of this great terroir, indisputably one of Piemonte's very finest. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2039. There's always something magical about Gaja's Sorì San Lorenzo. It’s the intensity and fullness of the wine that penetrates to the back of the palate and offers many long minutes of persistency on the finish. The bouquet is redolent of black fruit, leather, spice, tar, licorice and dried herb. Subtle and rich with raspberry and blueberry aromas and touches of peaches and lavender too. Full-bodied, with intense lavender and spice character with chocolate and fruit flavors. Long, long finish. A rich, muscular style, with black cherry, plum, smoke and spice aromas and flavors holding court. Balanced and smooth, in a modern style, showing refinement and length on the finish. "
875,Duboeuf Fleurie,2019,Gamay,France,21,14,3.9,30,"Floral nose showing notes of strawberries and black fruits. Quite refreshing, focused with purity of fruit on the palate. Fragrant aromas of ripe strawberry, watermelon, hibiscus, lemon zest and wet soil. It’s medium-bodied with fine, silky tannins and tangy acidity. "

877,Faiveley Chambertin Clos de Beze Grand Cru,2004,Pinot Noir,France,389,0,0.0,0,"At this stage in the wine’s development, it is virtually all tannin. Old wood flavors layered with dryness and spice do appear, and some fruit is apparent in the acidity. "
878,Hitching Post Highliner Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,38,0,4.3,5,"The 2019 Pinot Noir Highliner is a blend of sites in Santa Maria and the Sta. Rita Hills. Black cherry, plum, cloves, leather, mocha and incense lend notable complexity to this mid-weight, refreshing Pinot Noir. There is good depth and plenty of freshness to pull it all together. "
879,Decoy Red,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,25,13.9,4.0,70,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Decoy Red Wine is a well-balanced and nicely appointed red wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine shows attractive bright aromas and flavors showing red and black fruit, with a nice touch of oak. Enjoy it with grilled short ribs.

880,Guigal Cote Rotie La Turque,2006,Syrah/Shiraz,France,379,0,0.0,0,"Masculine and burly, the 2006 E. Guigal Côte-Rôtie La Turque is an absolutely stunning effort that delivers explosive aromas of rusted iron, blood, and crushed rock that are supported by smoky, meaty dark fruits. Ripe and concentrated on the palate, with full bodied power and depth, perfect balance, and huge underlying structure and tannin the comes through on the finish, this is actually approachable now given the level of fruit and texture. This pulls together grip, minerality and fruit, with charcoal and espresso laying the foundation, supporting crushed plum, fig sauce and mulled currant fruit, which then gives way to a vibrant, iron- and tobacco-filled finish that leaves a mouthwatering feel. Very impressive. "
881,Domaine Sigaut Chambolle-Musigny Les Noirots Premier Cru,2019,Pinot Noir,France,109,11.14,0.0,0,"Anne loves this terroir, rich and generous, with 45 year old vines. There are some whole bunches here for the first time, 20%, given the plumper nature of this terroir, and that adds a lovely little tingle which stretches out the finish. Very dainty red fruits. This is not a well-known Chambolle premier cru but on this showing it deserves greater fame! A ripe, spicy and beautifully layered nose speaks of liqueur-like aromas of cassis, violet and essence of dark cherry. The rich, even opulent, larger-scaled flavors manage to retain good refinement on the palate soaking, sappy and impressively persistent finish. Good stuff that should repay mid-term cellaring. "
882,Relic Wine Cellars Kashaya Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,79,13.5,0.0,0,"Medium ruby-purple in color, the 2018 Pinot Noir Kashaya explodes from the glass with floral and savory notes—red roses, wild thyme, Darjeeling tea and wild mushrooms—over a core of pomegranate, cranberries and rhubarb scents. The palate is medium-bodied and very finely constructed with soft, elegant tannins and a refreshing line, finishing on a lingering earthy note. Pretty wild strawberry, dried flowers, rose, and subtle stemmy notes emerge from the 2018 Pinot Noir Kashaya, which comes from a site just north of Hirsch Vineyard, in the Fort Ross-Seaview region of Sonoma. It’s medium-bodied, elegant, and seamless on the palate, with an already approachable style. Refined and fruit-forward, with a minerally essence to the dried red currant and cherry flavors, backed by crunchy acidity. The juicy finish is marked by spicy richness, with accents of slate and white pepper. Drink now through 2026. "
883,Domaine Tempier Bandol Rose,2021,Rosé,France,57,0,0.0,0,"Not included in the blind tasting at the local syndicat, Tempier's 2021 Bandol Rose nevertheless looked good when I tasted it at the estate. It's a very fine, elegant example of Bandol rosé, with notes of passion fruit and pink grapefruit leading the way in a tightly knit, medium-bodied package that adds promising hints of white peach and anise on the lingering finish. Tightly coiled and dense, this is still inviting and begins to unfurl with time in the glass. This has beautiful range to the ripe red berry and sweet currant flavors, which are set against savory, salty, fine-grained mineral and crushed dried thyme accents. A stunning rosé that's built to last. Mourvèdre, Grenache and Cinsault. Drink now. "
884,Testarossa Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,88,14.3,0.0,0,"Rich ruby color; elegant and pure, with a toasty nose, racy acidity, and lifted flavors of cherry and raspberry Offers rich acidity that backs an effusively juicy blend of red fruit and berry flavors. Displays a minerally verve and hints of underbrush on the firm, fine-grained finish. Drink now "
885,Cave de Ribeauville Cremant d'Alsace Brut Rose Le,Comte,Sparkling Rosé,France,24,12,4.5,15,"Really tart but totally aromatic notes of Cox Orange Pippin apples fill the nose. The palate brings in riper and more generous fruit, assisted by the creamy bubbles and that lovely autolytic hint of butter pastry. The finish is rounded, soft, refreshing and dry, leaving you with the impression of ripe red apple. "
886,Devil's Corner Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,Australia,19,12.5,3.9,11,"Fresh and light, but not shy on intensity. A touch of toasted sesame seed, fresh grated ginger and salted melon flavors add complexity to the core of citrus and ripe stone fruit flavors.  "
887,Fanti Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,55,14.5,4.9,5,"Aromas of red cherries, plums and pungent flowers follow through to a full body with medium chewy tannins that appear polished and creamy. Turns lightly dusty and savory with walnut and ripe fruit in the aftertaste. Drink or hold. The Fanti 2017 Brunello di Montalcino shows a slightly robust consistency and a heavier center of gravity compared to recent past releases. The wine is sensual and rich with impactful favors of red and purple fruit, forest floor, campfire ash and ferrous earth. The mouthfeel is powerful, but the wine still imparts a delicate, smooth-sailing personality with good tannic management. Best after 2024. The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is dark and balsamic in style, offering wild berries and woodland herbs complemented by hints of clove and cocoa. It’s unbelievably rich and potent, and almost creamy in texture, with ripe black currants and plums giving way to hints of mocha. This wraps the palate up tightly, delivering grippy tannins and a layer of primary concentration that creates an aching tension, as hints of licorice and bitter chocolate fade. The massive and powerful 2017 has all of the right ingredients in the right proportions to mature evenly. That said, I believe it will always have the feel of a caged beast. "
888,Domaine Casenobe Rivesaltes,1972,Other Fortified,France,129,16,0.0,0,"The 1972 Rivesaltes is missing a little intensity on the nose, scents of orange rind, antique furniture, walnut and light peaty notes that don't quite click into fifth gear. The palate is well balanced with a fine bead of acidity, touches of mandarin, dried fig, Chinese 5-spice and nutmeg with a precise if not powerful finish. There is just a hint of dark chocolate on the aftertaste, completing a fine Rivesaltes. Tasted with Philippe Gayral. "
889,Blandy's 10 Year Madeira Rich Malmsey,(500ML),Madeira,Portugal,23,19,4.3,61,"COMMENTARY: The Blandy's Malmsey Madeira, Aged 10 Years, sails on the palate with excellent richness and length. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of brine, dried citrus, cloves, and minerality. Enjoy it with crème Brulee and a mild cigar, if you dare. (Tasted: June 16, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Mildly syrupy in texture, this is an intensely sweet Madeira balanced by racy acidity. Rancio and brown sugar aromas lead the way, followed by flavors of caramelized nuts, molasses and burnt citrus peel. Excellent length on the finish, where the crisp acids really shine. Richly spiced, with orange pekoe tea notes to the caramelized apple, pear and dried fig flavors. Chocolate and spice accents show on the luscious finish. Drink now through 2025. "
890,Markham Merlot,2019,Merlot,California,26,14.8,3.9,7,"Inviting aromas of red cherry, sliced plum, rosemary and bark. Full-bodied with velvety tannins. Complex baking spice compliments the red and black fruit on the palate, with an earthy undertone throughout. "
891,Chateau Capbern,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,29,15.1,3.9,11,"I love the nose on the 2019 Château Capbern, a medium to full-bodied, spicy, rich, tobacco and cedar pencil-filled beauty with ripe yet building tannins, a great mix of richness and freshness, and a blockbuster of a finish. It's incredibly impressive, and while it offers pleasure even today, it deserves 5-6 years of bottle age, and I can't imagine it not evolving for two decades. Best after 2027. "
892,Chateau de Saint Cosme Condrieu,2020,Viognier,France,100,14.11,0.0,0,"Alluring, with creamed yellow apple, mirabelle plum and white peach flavors carried by a caressing hint of elderflower and lemon curd through the finish, where a late flash of white ginger peeks in. I’m always able to taste Louis’s Northern Rhône release as well. His 2020 Condrieu is medium to full-bodied, pure, and balanced, with that unique Condrieu ability to blend richness and freshness. Some classic tangerine, white flowers, and honeysuckle notes define the nose, and it’s beautifully done. Drink it over the coming 4-6 years. Barruol does a lovely job with Condrieu, which he sources from Malleval, what he calls ""the cold corner of Condrieu."" His 2020 Condrieu features flowery, blossom-like aromas, plus subtle pear and spice shadings. It's only medium-bodied, but provides hints of Viognier's opulence, with a long, silky-textured finish that barely hints at bitterness. "
893,Domaine Gros Frere et Soeur Richebourg Grand Cru,2018,Pinot Noir,France,599,0,0.0,0,"A top note of menthol is present on the markedly ripe if more reserved aromas of plum liqueur, cassis and pretty floral scents. There is dramatic richness, size and weight to the big-bodied and very serious flavors that exude a chocolate note on the moderately warm and wonderfully lengthy finale. This mineral-driven effort is a wine that is also going to benefit substantially from a long snooze in a cool cellar. "
894,Force Majeure Walla Walla Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Washington,189,0,0.0,0,"The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Walla Walla Valley Estate has a Mouton-like vibe in its ripe, sexy red and black currants as well as notes of chocolate, tobacco leaf, truffle, and damp earth. Much more broad, round, and expansive compared to the Red Mountain release, it has supple, velvety tannins, no hard edges, and a great finish. It's not far off the heavenly 2018 and will shine for 30 years as well. Readers will love being able to compare these two great vintages over the coming decades. Impeccably structured, full-bodied and refined, with distinctive blackberry, black olive, tobacco and spice flavors that build richness and density toward broad-shouldered tannins. Drink now. "
895,Gramercy Cellars Lower East Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,Washington,33,14,4.2,15,"Bright, fresh savory herb, graphite and flower aromas capture the attention. The plum and cherry flavors show impeccable balance, elegance and length. It has a compelling sense of freshness. Put it on the dinner table with grilled steak with chimichurri to get the most out of it. Sleek and sinewy, with black currant, tobacco and pencil lead tones that build structure and tannins on a handsome finish.  "
896,Uccelliera Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,77,15,0.0,0,"The Uccelliera 2017 Brunello di Montalcino does a great job showcasing that extra power and brawn of the vintage and the richer textural structure of the southern side of the appellation. The bouquet is up front and beautifully measured with lots of red and purple fruit definition followed by spice, tar and earthiness. What sets this wine apart in this hot and dry vintage is the mouthfeel. It delivers fiber, flesh and soft tannins. The alcohol is a bit much at 15% in this production of 28,666 bottles. Best after 2024. A solid 2017, but there’s tangy freshness to this, and relatively fine tannins that frame the wine nicely. Plenty of ripe fruit. Some fresh mushroom, too. Drink after 2023. Cherry and plum fruit flavors are allied to mint, camphor and spice flavors in this dense, powerful red, which is lively and resonates on the finish with echoes of fruit, herbs and spices. Best from 2025 "
897,Scharffenberger Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,California,29,12,4.2,67,"This crisp and classy wine tastes dry, tight but complex from the persimmon and raspberry aromas to the lively white-raspberry and white-peach flavors. It has taut acidity balanced by touches of spicy maturity that keep it interesting through the lingering finish. COMMENTARY: If I could go on a merry-go-round and snag a sparkling rosé as a prize, the Scharffenberger would be the one I would love to win. This wine has been my favorite in terms of value for the money. TASTING NOTES: This wine is active, charming, and bright. Its attractive aromas and flavors of red fruits, tangy citrus, and minerality should pair deliciously with a plate of fresh salmon sashimi wrapped in nori and perfectly-ripened avocado. (Tasted: December 23, 2019, San Francisco, CA) While this wine feels gentle, its briskness brightens its scents of strawberries and nasturtiums. It’s pinot noir at the cusp of ripeness, holding a floral green note that would take on duck rillettes.  56% Chardonnay; 44% Pinot Noir. Spot on with respect to Rosé’s fruitier bent but exhibiting a fine yeasty trim of autolysis and lots of youthful energy, this one is a vivacious, slightly lighter, carefully composed example of the genre that is both moderately rich and light on its feet. Juicy yet graceful and quietly complex, it is a pleasure to pour now with or without food, but its youthful brightness is such that it promises to keep famously and provide happy drinking for at least another three or four years. And, its relatively modest price belies just how good it is A sparkling wine with lots of strawberry and cherry aromas, as well as pear and apple undertones. It’s full-bodied with a fine-grained, creamy texture. Light cotton-candy character in the aftertaste. Yummy is the word. Drink now "
898,Dana Estates Hershey Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,759,15.8,0.0,0,"I was blown away by the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Hershey Vineyard. This is pure Napa Valley magic. Incredible cassis and darker berry fruits as well as smoked tobacco, graphite, and chalky minerality all define the bouquet, and it has a Château Latour-like structure and regalness on the palate. Perfectly balanced, deep, and concentrated, with perfectly integrated tannins, it should merit another point in a decade and will have 30-40 years of longevity. "
899,Dana Estates Helms Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,759,14.8,0.0,0,"The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Helms Vineyard is a medium to full-bodied, ripe, exotic, already complex beauty that gives up lots of cassis and plum fruits, notes of violets, orange blossom, and spice, building tannins, no hard edges, and a great finish. It’s an incredibly complex, layered, satisfying Cabernet Sauvignon to drink over the coming 20-25 years. "
900,Poggio di Sotto Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,300,0,0.0,0,"Made with certified-organic fruit, the 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is an impossibly graceful wine from a challenging vintage. This bottle defies the odds—and the dry heat of the growing season—to reveal soft layers of cherry, cassis and more vibrant fruit. It glides clear over the palate with silky momentum, and you only notice the tannins at the very end. Even those should soften and integrate as this collectible wine continues it bottle evolution. Production is 19,000 bottles. Best after 2024. This is one of those wines that you feel compelled to drink, not just taste. The nose entices with scents of red cherry, vine-ripened tomato and a hint of blood orange. The texture is smooth and harmonious, with no sharp edges but plenty of verve. Subtle spice notes are perfectly integrated, energizing the vivid fruit flavors and coaxing you to take another sip. Beautifully refined and balanced, it is hard to resist now, yet will give pleasure over many years to come. Cherries and orange peel with cedar and pine undertones. It’s full yet fresh and lightly chewy with some citrus at the end. Shows tension and firmness for the vintage with a pretty form and purity. From organically grown grapes. Better after 2022. Poggio di Sotto made 50% less wine in 2017 and will not release a Riserva. Maceration times were shorter than usual – just 25 to 30 days for the Brunello. It also spent three rather than four years in wood to avoid over-concentration. Aromas of steeped red berry infused with dried thyme and scorched orange peel make a heady first impression. The palate is mouth-filling and shows lovely purity of cherry and raspberry at the core. Concentrated in acidity with finely powdered, finessed tannins, this reveals just a hint of astringency on the orange liqueur and amaro finish. Bright flavors of strawberry, cherry and currant are at the core of this elegant red, which is balanced and long, with a fresh aftertaste evoking fruit and mineral hints. Firm, yet refined tannins should give this structure to evolve over the next decade and more.  "
901,Domaine de Bellene Beaune Hommage a Francoise Potel Premier Cru,2020,Pinot Noir,France,129,0,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2020 Domaine de Bellene Hommage à Françoise Potel Beaune is substantial and long. TASTING NOTES: This wine emits aromas and flavors of black fruit and savory spices. Enjoy it with a grilled ribeye topped with fully-ripened blue vein cheeses. (Tasted: May 9, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "
902,Bindi Sergardi Calidonia Chianti Classico Riserva,2015,Sangiovese,Italy,50,14.5,0.0,0,"An opulent red, showing strawberries, plums and white stones on the nose. Medium to full body, dusty tannins and a pure, clean finish. Aromas of red-skinned berries, underbrush and mint lead the way. The juicy, already accessible palate offers raspberry jam, white pepper and nutmeg alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. "
903,Chateau Margaux Pavillon Rouge (1.5 Liter Magnum),2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,476,13.5,0.0,0,"The blackcurrant and floral aromas with brick and hot stones are tantalizing. Flowers underneath it all. Medium to full body, firm and silky tannins with beautiful ripeness that highlights the palate. Second wine of Château Margaux. Try after 2024. With its dense texture and high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is an impressively powerful second wine of Château Margaux. Acidity and dark
blueberry flavors are concentrated, with layers of tannins that demand aging. Drink from 2023. The second wine of Château Margaux is the 2016 Pavillon Rouge, a blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot, and 3% Petit Verdot brought up in 60% new barrels. It too is incredibly classic, elegant, and finesse-driven, with textbook Margaux aromatics of cassis, ripe cherries, and spring flower, medium body, subtle background oak, and lively acidity. It has real class and is capable of 2-3 decades of longevity. Very refined and focused, with fine-grained sandalwood and alder accents lining a core of stylish, gently mulled cherry and blackberry fruit flavors. A perfumed lilac note weaves around the fruit on the elegant finish. Approachable now, but buried minerality lurks, and this is sneaky long, so cellaring is easily doable. Best from 2022 through 2035. This has softened and deepened over the 18 months of ageing yet still has a touch of austerity and will take a few years to settle down. It's not as plump or generous as the 2015, but it's a beautiful wine that has balance and effortless class - a wonderfully poised Pavillon Rouge. 60% new oak has lent it some toasted almond and tarry notes. It represents just 26% of the harvest, making this the smallest ever percentage of the crop to make it into the second wine. "
904,Wente Southern Hills Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,35,13.5,3.7,47,"This energetic, juicy red offers supple tannins and superb acidity, bolstering its dynamic food-pairing abilities. Bright red fruit jumps out of the glass, backed by orange peel and spiced coffee. "
905,Cedar + Salmon Willamette Valley Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,Oregon,30,13,3.6,15,"Aromas of chocolate-covered cherry in tilled soil give way to a plethora of savory and bold notes—cigar box, root beer, black plum—in this concentrated, muscular Pinot Noir. Its earthy nature is tempered by ripe black cherry and sandalwood, emphasizing the silky mouthfeel "
906,Egly-Ouriet Brut Tradition Grand,Cru,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,129,12.5,4.4,24,"Chiseled acidity provides firm definition for this chalky Champagne, though it's swathed on the palate by a creamy range of flavors, including passion fruit coulis, toasted almond, blood orange sorbet and lime blossom. A streak of salinity races on the finish. "
907,Cadre Sea Queen Albarino,2021,Albarino,California,27,13.5,4.1,7,"Clean aromas of crisp pear are coated in a wet-stone veil on the nose of this bottling. The texture is impressive on the palate, giving a rocky backbone to the rounded pear, apple and melon flavors. COMMENTARY: The 2021 Cadre Sea Queen Albarino is pleasing from start to finish. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of dried earth, green apple, and a hint of chalk. Enjoy it with steamed mussels with an accent of red chili flakes.

908,Chateau Duhart-Milon,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,99,13.5,4.6,17,"Enticing aromas of crushed berries, blackcurrants, sweet tobacco, hot stones and licorice follow through to a full body, chewy and dusty tannins and a long, flavorful finish. A juicy and savory young 2016. Try after 2024. I remember how delicious this was at en primeur, and it remains a stately, elongated, perfectly poised Pauillac. It's austere, certainly, but is also full of rich fruit pared down by a slate texture, the sense of minerality scraping along the palate as you approach the blackcurrant leaf and tobacco finish. It's excellent quality, and clearly a vintage that suits the personality of Duhart - juicy but restrained. Matured in 50% new oak. Ranking with the finest vintages of this wine to date, the 2016 Château Duhart Milon shows how successful the Médoc was in 2016. About as pure class as it gets, with full-bodied notes of red and black currants, tobacco leaf, graphite, and leafy herbs, this beauty hits the palate with sweet tannins, a stacked mid-palate, and a layered, deep, powerful texture. It’s about as sexy as Pauillac can be and has 2-3 decades ahead of it. This bottling shows the vastly improved quality of this estate that still represents good value for the appellation and for its provenance as part of the Lafite-Rothschild stable. The wine is structured while full of ripe berry fruits. It has weight and density, rich with swathes of delicious fruits as well as tannins. It will develop well; Best after 2023. Blended of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot, the 2016 Duhart-Milon has a deep garnet-purple color and features plums preserves, wild blueberries and cassis scents with touches of violets and underbrush with a waft of tobacco. Medium-bodied and elegant, with a backbone of finely grained tannins and oodles of freshness, it has a great core of perfumed black fruit, finishing on an earthy note. This is very vivid, with racy violet, cassis and plum aromas and flavors coursing through, laced with a mouthwatering anise note and leading to a long, focused finish. Displays a terrific iron underpinning. Best from 2024 through 2038. "
909,Henschke Mount Edelstone Shiraz,2016,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,219,14.5,0.0,0,"This has intense spice and sage, as well as bay-leaf aromas with intense, vivid blackberries and red plums. Blueberry notes, too. There’s so much spice, violet and bergamot, together with black tea-like notes. The palate has an immaculately framed tannin structure with rich blackberries and blueberries, as well as plum notes. This layers up so nicely on the palate. Very intense and powerful yet fine texture. An exceptional vintage for Mt. Edelstone. From vines planted in 1912. Drink or hold. The 2016 Mount Edelstone Vineyard Shiraz is steeped in complexity, with aromas ranging from camphor, bay leaf and sage to smoke and grilled beef and from blueberries and blackberries to plums laced with spice. Full-bodied, rich and intense, it's ripe and velvety textured, with a long, licorice-tinged finish and dusty tannins that bode well for the cellar. From vines planted in 1912, I suspect this will come close to the quality of the Hill of Grace at a fraction of the price. Tasted again the following day from the open bottle, this was even better, seamless, flowing and harmonious in the mouth. Aromatic and elegant, but definitely not shy, showing rich, pure wild blackberry puree, huckleberry and blueberry pie flavors on a silky frame, with details of Earl Grey tea, palo santo, cigar box and salted dark chocolate. Ends with a tremendous finish that goes on and on. Drink now through 2046. "
910,Presqu'ile Santa Barbara Syrah,2020,Syrah/Shiraz,California,28,13.2,0.0,0,"I was able to taste two Syrahs. The 2020 Syrah Santa Barbara County has lots of peppery stems and floral aromatics as well as both red and black fruits, medium body, notes of violets, iron, and leather, ripe tannins, and a great finish. It reminds me of an old-school Saint-Joseph and will keep for a decade. "
911,CARO Amancaya,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,Argentina,21,14.5,4.1,49,"Aromas of currants, sweet tobacco and oyster shell follow through to a medium to full body with firm, creamy tannins and a steely finish. Drink after 2021. Lithe, with notes of underbrush to the concentrated red berry and cherry flavors. Showcases peppery hints in the midpalate, with a taut and minerally finish. Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon. "
912,Luigi Baudana Langhe Dragon Bianco,2021,Other White Blends,Italy,22,13.5,4.4,8,"A blend of mostly Chardonnay, with Sauvignon Blanc, Nascetta and a touch of Riesling, the Luigi Baudana 2021 Langhe Bianco Dragon (in a screw-cap bottle) is super fresh and zesty with lovely citrus, white almond and fresh honeysuckle. The wine's lean and direct style would pair with sushi or a grilled fish with olive oil and lemon. "
913,Amisfield Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,Zealand,41,14.5,0.0,0,"This is a very spicy pinot with plenty of toasty-oak influence, across brambly red cherries and berries.

914,Starmont Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,California,22,13.5,3.6,61,"Both barrel and stainless-steel fermented, this is a bright, balanced white wine that shows a juicy core of pear and apple. Lively and weighty, it has substance and style within a context of vibrant acidity and earthy stone. A pretty tight Napa chardonnay with cooked apples, cream, crushed cement and hints of flint.

916,Gaja Costa Russi (1.5 Liter Magnum),2008,Nebbiolo,Italy,739,14.5,0.0,0,"he 2008 Costa Russi is absolutely gorgeous. Sweet dark cherries, tar, licorice and new leather are some of the aromas and flavors that take shape in the glass. The 2008 is a firm Costa Russi, with less of the seductiveness of most years, but equally fine balance. Ideally it needs a few more years in bottle, but it is striking. The finish shows terrific intensity. The typical juiciness of the site is framed by the firm tannins of the year. Everything that makes Costa Russi such an engaging wine is here, but in a slightly smaller-scaled package than in the very finest years. Blackberries and flowers on the nose follow through to a full body, with chewy tannins and a round texture. All in finesse and length. Deep and rich, this red is fresh and vibrant, displaying mint, cherry, licorice and spice flavors. Framed in oak, both spice and tannins, with a taut structure and fine length. "

Very spicy mushroom-powder and flower character. Dried-lemon undertones. Full-bodied, medium sweet, dense and flavorful with so much fruit intensity and bright acidity. Vibrant. Drink or hold. "

A perfumed nose of dark cherry, plum, coconut, cedar and dried thyme. Full-bodied with chewy tannins. Rich and structured with a chalky texture and a firm, delicious finish. Better from 2022. "

Dark garnet to the eye, this wine has aromas of black currant, licorice and Marcona almond. Its smooth tannins feel good on the palate. Opening flavors of bittersweet chocolate and mint hit the tastebuds first, followed by flavors of blackberry and raspberry that are joined by touches of vanilla and baking spice on the finish. "
924,Clos Henri Petit Clos Pinot Noir,2020,Pinot Noir,Zealand,19,13.5,4.1,72,"Pure strawberry and black-cherry aromas with slate and spice undertones.

There are 200 cases of the 2018 Petite Sirah Alfred Frediani Vineyard Old Vines, which comes from vines planted in 1939 and spent 19 months in 37% new oak. Violet-tinged blue fruits, bouquet garni, and some rocky, earthy mineral-notes emerge from this medium to full-bodied red, which has building tannins, a good spine of acidity, and outstanding length. It’s going to evolve positively for 3-5 years and then drink nicely for at least a decade. "
927,Louis Jadot Bonnes-Mares Grand Cru,2000,Pinot Noir,France,349,0,0.0,0,"There is a vague whiff of reduction lurking in the background of the clearly ripe and moderately secondary nose that reflects notes of earth, sauvage and mostly dark berry fruit scents. There is excellent richness to the equally ripe and palate coating broad-shouldered flavors that coat the palate with dry extract, all wrapped in a robust, rustic and noticeably warm finale. The balance isn't quite dialed in but this certainly can't be faulted for a lack of character. As to the current state of evolution, it's an open question as to whether the fruit will out live the tannins but I would be inclined to either serve it over the next few years with an appropriate dish or allow it another 6 to 8 years first to at least resolve some of the presently very grippy structure.

This pretty wine is open-knit and rich, showing nice textural support. It is redolent of dried cherry, blackberry, light spice, tar and smoke. This special selection of fruit shows elegant results in this hot and sunny vintage. Production is 3,200 bottles and some larger formats. Enticing, earthy aromas of new leather, truffle and violet mingle with ripe woodland berries. Boldly structured but also showing a weightless elegance, the savory palate delivers ripe cranberry, cherry marinated in spirits, licorice and tobacco framed in taut, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2023–2030. This is a late-release 2015 with extremely attractive blackberry, black-cherry and floral aromas, as well as hints of spices. Full-bodied with wonderfully integrated tannins that are polished yet powerful. Long, persistent finish, showing real purity of fruit. Try after 2023, but already impressive. "
931,Podere Grattamacco Bolgheri Superiore,2018,Tuscan Blends,Italy,119,14.61,0.0,0,"This wine is packed with pure flavors of blackcurrant and raspberry buoyed by brisk acidity. A blend of cabernet sauvignon with 20 percent merlot and 15 percent sangiovese, Grattamacco aged in French oak barriques, about one-third new, where the lightly chewy tannins developed, giving shape to the bold, primary frut tones. The wine takes on notes of graphite and fresh tobacco, while lively spices energize the fruit, drawing out the flavors on a long, exuberant finish. Coming on the heels of the scorching hot 2017, this vintage started off with lots of rain in April and May that required preventative measures against fungal disease. Splendid heat and sunshine marked the summer months, but the freshness you taste in this wine is a beautiful characteristic of this cooler growing season. The 2018 Bolgheri Superiore Grattamacco reveals a finely nuanced bouquet with dark fruit, tobacco, smoke and earthy garrigue or underbrush. The wine leans toward full-bodied, but it also feels quite elegant and crisp on the streamlined finish. Best after 2023. A mix of coffee and black olive flavors shade the core of black currant and black cherry in this dense, linear red, which is focused and long, with a mouthwatering finish. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese. Best from 2024 through 2040. Currants, blackberries and hints of chocolate and fresh herbs. Full-bodied and round-tannined with a lovely texture and a savory, almost iron finish. Cabernet sauvignon, merlot and sangiovese. From organically grown grapes. Hard not to drink now, but a year or two will bring it even more together. "

934,Lapostolle Cuvee Alexandre Cabernet Sauvignon,2020,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,23,14.5,3.9,13,"A rich and deep expression of blackcurrants and blackberries with hints of red chili pepper, tobacco and cocoa powder, following through to a full body with powerful but fine, seamless tannins. A dash of petit verdot here. Compact and bright. "
935,Lavau Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,37,14.5,4.6,5,"Vibrant, fruity nose of red plums, cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, olives and red tea. It’s full-bodied with firm, creamy tannins. Round and supple. Some chocolate notes on the finish. Fresh and elegant for the appellation. Drink or hold. Holds the new oak remarkably well (50% new), it's not excessive in aroma or texture from this sample. Well balanced with fine tannins and a little salty note - pretty smart stuff. Should be good when it's ready, no excesses here. Best yet from Lavau. An outstanding wine, the 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape offers lots of ripe black and blue fruits as well as plenty of pepper, cedar, and sappy, green garrigue-like aromas and flavors. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it’s nicely textured and has terrific balance along with a great finish.

940,Fess Parker Santa Barbara Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,California,20,14.1,3.9,12,"A great entry-level expression for the veteran winery, this bottling begins with clean aromas of white peach, gardenia and woody potpourri on the nose.

It follows through onto the palate which is intense, juicy and fresh, this has more concentration than most this year, but without over extraction. Perfectly ripe, chunky and powerful, but not heavy. Fermented in concrete, matured for 12 months in foudre and demi-muid. This is brimming with dark cherry, blackberry and boysenberry compote flavors that spill forth, laced with generous licorice snap, tar, graphite and black tea notes. A nice tug of iron appears very late on the finish, as the fruit lingers on. Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre.  "
942,Chateau Leoville Las Cases,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,299,14.49,4.6,13,"Pure magic and one of the finest expressions of this estate I could imagine, as well as a perfect wine, the 2018 Château Léoville Las Cases comes from a mix of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, and 9% Cabernet Franc that spent 19 months in (I believe) all new French oak. Its dense purple color is followed by a profound wine loaded with notions of crème de cassis, lead pencil shavings, melon, crushed stone, tobacco, and violets. Full-bodied, concentrated, and massive on the palate, yet also incredibly well delineated and precise, it has a wonderful mix of seemingly ripe, sunny fruit from a warm year yet the minerality, purity, and precision of a cooler year. This wine is going to be just about immortal; however, do your best to hide bottles for a solid 10-15 years. An elegant, complex nose of blackberries, blueberries and herbal and spice notes with dark-chocolate and earthy undertones. Violets, flowers and graphite, too. It’s full-bodied with firm, layered tannins and a crushed-stone undertone throughout the fresh, velvety and layered palate. Very complex, muscular and formed. The finish is endless. Lowest percentage of press wine ever in this. So deep. Try after 2027. This has such a textured, ripe, plump and poised black fruit character that is clear from the aromatics alone. Mouthfilling with huge texture and density, full of licorice root, black chocolate shavings and cocoa pod with crème de cassis edging. This is delicious and has chewy tannins that you can pick up with a shovel. One of the 'wines of the vintage'. Only 2% of press wine (unusually low, as it can go up to 15% in some years). It grips on tight to the finish - extremely impressive. 90% new oak. Drinking Window 2028 - 2050 The 2018 Léoville Las Cases is composed of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, harvested September 15 to October 4 with yields of 35.5 hectoliters per hectare, it has 14.49% alcohol and was aged in 90% new barriques. Deep purple-black colored, it needs a fair bit of coaxing to reveal striking scents of blackcurrant pastilles, wild blueberries and redcurrant jelly, giving way to notions of crushed rocks, lavender, Indian spices, unsmoked cigars and black truffles, plus a provocative waft of rose oil. The full-bodied palate is densely laden with black fruit preserves and earthy layers, accented by bright, lively red berry and floral sparks. It has a rock-solid frame of firm, ripe, grainy tannin's and bold freshness, finishing very long and wonderfully minerally. The tannin's are so beautifully approachable even at this youthful stage, making it delicious to drink now, but afford it 5-6 years in bottle to allow those finer nuances to emerge and drink it over the next 40+ years. Reserved, even reticent, at first, but like a cold fireplace brought back to life it slowly reveals beautifully handcrafted notes of cassis, plum reduction and blackberry puree along with hints of charcoal, warm cast iron and sweet bay leaf. A violet note chimes on the seriously long finish, adding a tantalizing treble note. A precise, regal, terroir-driven wine. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2028 through 2042. "

945,Chateau Bourdieu,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,14,14,3.7,113,"Blackberry and black-olive aromas. Medium body with round, dusty tannins. Chocolate aftertaste. Merlot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc. Better in a year. "
946,Egly-Ouriet Grand Cru Blanc de Noirs Les,Crayeres,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,299,12.5,4.7,11,"A lush Champagne, swathing the firm acidic backbone with a fine, creamy and satiny mousse that carries overtones of spice and smoke, accenting finely meshed flavors of roasted plum, candied ginger, toasted almond and saffron. A vinous version, this is almost food in a glass, but should pair well with poultry, pork and more. "
947,Los Vascos Cromas Gran Reserva Carmenere,2019,Carmenere,Chile,21,14.5,3.9,39,"Dark berries with sweet-tobacco and flower-stem undertones. Full-bodied with a tight, juicy and rather tannic palate. Flavorful finish. Just a hint of chocolate and cedar at the end. A more muscular style of carmenere. Better in a year or two, but already excellent. The 2019 Carménère Cromas Gran Reserva is the first vintage for this wine from Peralillo, Colchagua, which was 50% aged in French barrels. Intense purple in the glass. The wood floats over blackberry and raspberry aromas accompanied by roasted red pepper and fruit jam. Ample and creamy on the palate, it delivers a satisfying, flavorful flow with a big, sugary but not overly sweet finish. Vibrant acidity backs the concentrated dark fruit and Asian spice flavors in this red, with plenty of dark chocolate accents, followed by dried mint and forest floor notes on the finish. "

949,Chateau Ducluzeau,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,18,14,4.1,75,"Very attractive, bright cassis and blackberries with attractive spice and undergrowth complexity. The palate has a sleek, neatly aligned feel with long and succulent tannins that deliver fresh, purple-fruit flavor. This has a fresh, focused finish From the team at Ducru-Beaucaillou, the 2016 Château Ducluzeau is possibly one of the finest Listracs produced in any vintage. This beauty offers a medium ruby color to go with a terrific perfume of sweet cherry and dark fruits that are supported by loads of leafy herbs, damp earth, and even hints of graphite. Shockingly deep, medium-bodied, and beautifully concentrated, with ripe tannins, it shines for its purity and nuance but offers serious intensity as well. It’s a fabulous wine to drink over the coming 10-15 years. COMMENTARY: The 2016 Chateau Ducluzeau shows excellent richness and pleasure on the palate.

Stunning concentration with everything balanced on a pinhead. The underlying structure is enormous, but beautifully integrated in the rich and full body. Bright and pure finish that extends a really long way out. From biodynamically grown grapes. Drink or hold. "
951,Gaia Ritinitis Nobilis,Retsina,Other White Wine,Greece,18,12,3.1,135,"Yiannis Paraskevo- poulos’s Ritinitis has set the bar high for Ret- sina for years, but this vintage hits it out of the park. He bases it on roditis grown in the cool heights of the Peloponnese vinified in stainless steel, so that the base wine itself is bright and lively, with vibrant acidity and a mineral grip. The resin, culled from a par- ticular stand of Aleppo pines, goes in fresh and in moderation. The combination always creates a cooling, refreshing Retsina, but this vintage (2020) has an electric intensity. It’s head-turning in aroma, more seaside-pine- grove than direct pine resin, and arresting in flavor, delivering a jolt of bright, fresh herbal flavor that wakes up every nerve in the body. Close your eyes and it might send you direct to a quiet beach on the Aegean, the wind whisking through the pines at your back, a sea-salt haze hanging over the blue sea. "

955,Bodegas Ramirez de la Piscina Reserva,2016,Tempranillo,Spain,25,14.5,3.9,130,"Deep ruby. A deeply perfumed bouquet displays an array of ripe dark fruits and pungent flowers, along with oak spice, vanilla and coconut accents that emerge with aeration. Juicy and appealingly sweet, offering concentrated, spice-tinged blackberry, cherry-vanilla and mocha flavors and a subtle licorice nuance. Finishes supple, sweet and very long, with steadily building tannins that meld smoothly with the wine's intense dark fruit. A selection from parcels in Abalos, the Ramírez de la Piscina family’s home town, and San Vicente de la Sonsierra, both in Rioja Alta, this is a youthfully intense 2016. It builds power out of sour cherry and ripe black-cherry flavors, the savory tannins of the grape skins adding chewiness and a gamey note. Suited to several years of development in the cellar, this is an impressive value. Bright violet. Mineral-tinged red and blue fruit preserve and floral scents are complemented by hints of vanilla, tobacco and licorice. Sappy, expansive black raspberry and blueberry flavors smoothly blend weight and energy and pick up an allspice nuance on the back half. Closes long and appealingly sweet, with round, even tannin's and an echo of sappy blue fruit.  COMMENTARY: The 2016 Ramírez de la Piscina Rioja Reserva is an excellent and authentic wine.

956,Sine Qua Non B-20 Syrah,2008,Syrah/Shiraz,California,399,15.5,0.0,0,"""The 2008 Syrah B-20 is a cool, inward wine graced with layers of beautifully delineated, chiseled fruit. This is a distinctly mineral, precise style relative to the more outgoing 2009, but both are striking. Floral notes add lift as the finish turns explosive with a burst of dark fruit, tar, licorice and crushed rocks. This is one of the more understated wines readers are likely to come across from Sine Qua Non. It is gorgeous when given the time to open up. The B-20 is predominantly Syrah, with 6% Grenache and 2% Viognier. About half of the Grenache was fermented with whole clusters and the wine was aged in French oak (60% new) for 26 months.

The nose leads with a combo of toasty hazelnut, dried fig, lemon verbena, orange zest and dried lavender aromas. The palate, while a little lacking in depth of flavor and length, comes with fresh, vigorous bubbles and a chalky texture. A solid drop from one of Tasmania’s best-known producers. This offers attractive red berries and strawberry pastry, as well as some peach and melon notes. The palate has a supple, fresh delivery of quite deeply flavorful strawberries with a soft, gently creamy edge to the finish. A savory sparkler, this wine’s tart strawberry flavors and bitter apple-skin notes set an austere style, while the fine bubbles make it friendly. Clean and firm, this will needle an appetite for raw oysters. "
959,Bodegas Beronia Rioja Reserva,2017,Tempranillo,Spain,22,14,4.2,21,"A soft, fruity red with berry, chocolate and walnut character. Medium body, creamy-textured tannins and plenty of flavor at the end. Drink or hold. "
960,EnRoute Winery Brumaire Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,50,14.5,4.8,8,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 EnRoute Brumaire Chardonnay packs an excellent experience on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas of citrus, apple, savory spices, and oak. Try it with pan-fried halibut in a creamy, wine reduction sauce accented with fresh rosemary. (Tasted: September 11, 2021, San Francisco, CA) "
961,Joseph Drouhin Pouilly-Fuisse,2020,Chardonnay,France,37,13,0.0,0,"Lithe and focused, this white evokes peach, apple, lemon and pastry aromas and flavors. Vibrant acidity extends the finish, which boasts accents of baking spices. "
962,Chateau LaTour-Martillac,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,38,13.5,0.0,0,"I loved the 2019 Château Latour-Martillac, and I under-rated it from barrel. Revealing a dense ruby/plum color as well as a gorgeous bouquet of blackcurrants, black cherry, smoked tobacco, gravely earth, and chocolate, it hits the palate with full-bodied richness, a round, layered mouthfeel, supple tannins, and one heck of a finish. It's beautifully done and will cruise for 25+ years in cold cellars. It needs plenty of air if drinking any time soon. Sweet berry, spice, tobacco and dried rose-petal aromas. Full-bodied with beautifully integrated tannins and a creamy, polished texture. Refined and complex. One of the best young bottles ever from here. Best after 2025. Owned by the Kressmann family, a long-established Bordeaux negociant, this wine has ripe black fruits and dusty tannins. Both rich and structured, this wine needs aging and will be ready from 2026. This compact yet accessible wine is juicy, offering a solid burst of steeped plum and black currant fruit laced with black licorice and ending with a tarry note. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Drink now. "

964,Chateau d'Yquem Sauternes,2005,Other Dessert,France,430,13.5,4.4,19,"The pale to medium lemon-gold colored 2005 d'Yquem opens with a provocative, mineral and earth-tinged nose of chalk dust, wet pebbles and dried wild mushrooms over a core of warm apricots, green mango, honeyed toast, ginger and pink grapefruit plus wafts of honeycomb, orange blossoms and saffron. The palate confirms the wine is still a little closed and shut down, offering achingly gorgeous glimpses at the tightly wound, intricate layers structured with a racy acid line and wonderfully creamy texture, finishing incredibly long and perfumed. This decadent flavor bomb still needs a good five to seven years in bottle before it is set to go off, but oh what a spectacle it will give then! This isn't sweet, but just so wonderfully rich. It’s the concentration of botrytis that makes the wine. The texture is velvet, but with a spicy bite to it. Apricot, honey and marzipan all contribute to a wine that will age over decades. This has a deliciously pure feel, with juicy, inviting green plum, ginger, heather, creamed pineapple and Jonagold apple flavors all melded together and gliding through the lengthy finish, which echoes with lilting flowers and dried citrus notes. Best from 2015 through 2045. What an incredible nose of flowers, honey, spices such as clove, and sandalwood. With time, decadent aromas of apple tart and crumble develop. Full and very round on the palate, this is medium sweet with a velvety texture. Flavors of honey, apple and pear tart appear on the long finish. This is so beautiful, hard not to drink now but will greatly improve with more time. "
965,Chateau l'Enclos,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,34,0,4.0,13,"A perfumed nose of blackberries, dark cherries, violets, bark, mocha, dried flowers and smoke. Full-bodied with fine, ripe tannins. Fleshy and balanced with an intense core of fruit and chocolate. Refined and gorgeously textured with a long, vibrant finish. Drink from 2025. The Pomerol estate owned by Stephen and Denise Adams of Fonplégade. This is gorgeous, has a bounce in its step, lovely firm supple blackberry and black cherry fruits with a lot of juice that gives lift and character to the fruit. Full of chocolate shavings and mocha-edged charcoal. Very good. Features ripe plum and blackberry fruit flavors with a slightly baked hint, plus black tea, cedar and savory details that add range and energy through the plush finish. Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Best from 2023. An outstanding effort, the 2019 Château L'Enclos sports a dense purple hue to go with ripe, powerful aromatics of black cherries, cedary spice, iron, and subtle chocolate and earthy notes. It's textured, balanced, and medium to full-bodied, with ripe tannins. Drink it over the coming 10-15 years. Best after 2022. "
966,Domaine de la Vieille Julienne Chateauneuf-du-Pape Les Hauts-Lieux,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,99,0,0.0,0,"The 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape Les Hauts-Lieux includes slightly more Mourvèdre and comes from a cooler parcel in the northern part of the appellation. It has another level of purity and precision compared to the Trois Sources and has extraordinary notes of blueberries, cassis, black licorice, violets, and crushed stone-like minerality. Incredibly concentrated, massive, and yet perfectly balanced, it has no hard edges and is just an incredible tasting experience. Hide bottles for 4-5 years and enjoy over the following 20-25 years. A little more floral in style, silkier than the Trois Sources this year. It's a little more Northern in spirit than most this year, not quite so sunny. No Syrah in the blend here, plentiful Mourvèdre however, which performed well in 2019. From three parcels close to the limestone plateau, some clay, relatively high altitude and late ripening, with less exposition to the sun. "
967,Tour Saint Christophe,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,41,14.3,3.9,11,"Beautiful, intense fruit, dark-earth and chocolate character on the nose. Full-bodied with great density and plush, fine tannins that give a fine-velvet texture. It’s extremely long, polished and sophisticated. Needs time to come together, but expressive and glorious. Fantastic relative value. 80% merlot and 20% cabernet franc. Drink after 2025. This estate has been delivering the goods for numerous vintages now, and the 2019 Château Tour Saint Christophe is another terrific wine. Ripe black cherries, black raspberries, graphite, new leather, and chalky minerality all define the nose, and it's medium to full-bodied, has a tight, straight, focused texture, ripe yet present tannins, and outstanding length. It doesn't have the mid-palate density or opulence of the 2018, but it’s more pretty, focused, and straight on the palate. Give bottles 4-5 years and enjoy over the following two decades. Best After 2026 From clay-rich soils opposite Troplong Mondot in the commune Saint Christophe des Bardes, the 2019 Tour Saint Christophe offers up demonstrative aromas of cherries, wild berries, sweet loamy soil, licorice and dark chocolate. Full-bodied, rich and fleshy, with an enveloping core of fruit, lively acids and ripe, powdery tannins, it's a strong effort in a crowd-pleasing style. Best after 2021. "
968,Chateau Canon,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,199,14,4.2,14,"Complex aromas of blackberries, iodine, oyster shell and wet earth. Ever so perfumed. Full-bodied, yet reserved and tight with very silky tannins that are energized and minerally. Takes off at the end. The freshness lifts it. Try after 2024. This has all the power that St-Emilion can deliver, but deals it out slowly with precision, gorgeous balance and a clean lift. It has great concentration, purity and depth, without sacrificing the integrity of the juicy blueberry and cassis fruits. It really is a great example of what the limestone plateau can do. The 2015 delivers a slightly more voluptuous edge to the fruits, whereas this vintage emphasises fresh mint leaf, salinity and grip. A wonderful wine, utterly delicious. The 2016 Château Canon is another beautiful wine from this estate, made in a more streamlined, elegant style compared to the richer, sexier 2015. Checking in as a blend of 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc all from a magical terroir situated on the upper plateau just outside of the village of Saint-Emilion, it saw a small percentage of the blend go through malolactic fermentation in barrel, and the wine spent 18 months in 70% new French oak, with the balance in once-used. Gorgeous notes of blueberries, cassis, spring flowers, white truffle, and crushed rock nuances all come soaring from the glass and it has notable intensity as well as complexity. Medium to full-bodied, with vibrant acidity, ultra-fine tannins, and a straight, silky texture, I don’t think it matches the 2015 on concentration, but it’s perfectly balanced and has a texture to die for. It needs a good 4-5 years of bottle age (or more) and it’s going to be long-lived. Tasted three times. This delivers a pretty serious ball of fruit, with a mix of raspberry, blueberry and black currant flavors providing range, while sweet tobacco notes and chalky minerality impart texture and detail. There's a fresh savory echo on the finish. Much less reliant on toast than most of its peers. Best from 2022 through 2037. Very generously appointed with ripe, black cherry fruit and decked
out with a broad sweep of sweet spice in both scent and taste
and showing lovely continuity and fine concentration, Château
Canon is a serious, far-reaching St.-Emilion wine that compels
contemplation and seems to reveal a little more interest with
each sniff and sip. It is not an immense wine, but it is one of
great strength and real beauty that is guaranteed to pay even
greater dividends when laid away and allowed to develop for six
to ten years. "

974,Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,209,13.5,4.6,11,"That sexy, smoky, exuberant feeling of La Croix and Lalande-Borie in 2015 is found here too, but with everything turned up a notch - or rather tuned up a notch, giving finesse and precision to the texture and shape. Pure blackberry and blueberry fruits and an incredibly silky texture draws out through the glass. You can almost slide off this wine it is so expertly played, finessed and presented. And you are so seduced that you almost miss the tannic build up that hits you on the finish. Great stuff! 100% new oak. Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2015 Ducru-Beaucaillou rocks up with flamboyant baked black plums, crème de cassis, blueberry compote and chocolate-covered cherries scents plus hints of cinnamon stick, black tea and candied violets. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is laden with black fruit preserves and spicy accents, with a firm, velvety frame and finishing with great length and perfume. Ideally, I'd give it another year to fan out just a bit more, but it is coming around nicely and is already fantastically delicious! Aromas of oyster shell, iron and currants. Hints of iodine. Full-bodied, very tight and focused. Love the finish of sandalwood, cinnamon, violets and lavender. Wonderful tannin texture. Linear and driven. Drink in 2022. Showy, with layers of warmed fig, roasted mesquite, black tea, incense and Turkish coffee notes, followed by waves of lush cassis, blackberry and raspberry confiture flavors. This has a graphite grounding rod, a tarry spine and riveting licorice snap details to keep it driving along. A head-turner for sure. Best from 2025 through 2045. The 2015 Ducru-Beaucaillou is a Cabernet Sauvignon dominated wine (there’s 5% Merlot) that was brought up in 100% new barrels. It’s a classic, elegant, classy 2015 revealing a deep, saturated purple color as well as terrific notes of crème de cassis, smoked earth, lead pencil, and violets. With full-bodied richness, ultra-fine tannin, and a stacked mid-palate, it should start to shine in 6-7 years and keep for three decades. "
975,Chateau Pontet-Canet (1.5 Liter Magnum),2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,374,13.5,0.0,0,"The 2016 Pontet-Canet is absolutely breathtaking. Powerful, ample and racy in the glass, the 2016 is one of the most exquisitely well-balanced young Pontet-Canets I can remember tasting. Savory, high-toned aromatics and brisk mineral notes lend energy and delineation as this vivid wonderfully alive wine opens up in the glass. The flavors are dark and incisive, but it is the wine's total sense of harmony that is most compelling. All of the elements are simply in the right place. The 2016 is tremendous. It's as simple as that. As is often the case, Pontet-Canet is one of the most singular wines in Bordeaux. Alfred Tesseron could have chosen to play things safe when he took over the management of the estate in the mid-1990s. Instead, he chose a very different path. No proprietor in Bordeaux has taken more risks over the last two decades than Alfred Tesseron. A commitment to biodynamic farming, sustainability across the entire estate more broadly, and the adoption of new concepts for Bordeaux, such as aging a portion of the wine in terra cotta, set Pontet-Canet apart from other properties in Pauillac and the Left Bank. Not surprisingly, the wine is also starkly different from the wines of neighboring estates. The 2016 is a vintage that shows off the best of Pontet, and is similar in feel to their 2010. Gorgeously rich right from the first nose, it opens stunningly in the glass, showing waves of tight black fruits, touches of redcurrant, liquorice and aniseed, fine tannins and mouthwatering salinity. It manages to remain balanced without losing the punch and concentration of Pauillac, rising up through the palate. It's hard not to fall in love with this wine, and it will clearly age with grace and ease. Bottled in July 2018. The aromas of ripe blackcurrants, iodine, sweet tobacco and fresh flowers are spellbinding. Full-bodied with mouth-expanding, massive and natural tannins. Impressive fruit with hints of prunes. The finish is long and powerful. Needs six to seven years to soften and come together This is sappy and rich in feel, with waves of red and black currant preserves, raspberry and bitter plum coulis. The long finish drips with sweet tobacco and anise notes, while a brambly layer courses underneath. The vivacious finish kicks into second gear as the fruit and grip come together. Best from 2023 through 2038. "

This old vine parcel has lots of small berries (millerands) and always produces an intensely fruity, textured wine.

981,Taylor Fladgate 10 Year Old,Tawny,Port,Portugal,35,20,4.4,388,"It is my opinion that Taylor's tawny ports are the best of their type. When tasted against other tawnys, they all exhibit more aromatic personalities, greater fruit and ripeness, and a wonderful sweetness and length. The Ten Year Old Tawny is a personal favorite, as well as the best bargain among these ports. Beautiful sweet berries with walnut, toffee and caramel undertones on the nose. The palate is medium-bodied with medium sweetness and a chocolate and toffee aftertaste. A richer style of 10-year-old and delicious. Drink now. Juicy and focused, offering dried cherry, fig and bergamot notes inlaid with red licorice and fruitcake flavors that marry the flattering and racy sides. This ivery complete aged tawny has all the right nuts and fruit characters that show a Port that still looks back to its fruity origins.

988,La Rioja Alta Vina Ardanza Reserva (375ML half-bottle),2012,Tempranillo,Spain,23,14.5,3.9,24,"Traditional and beautiful in character with plum, balsamic, orange-peel and leather aromas and flavors. It’s medium-to full-bodied with creamy texture and a long, intense aftertaste. Drink or hold. Garnacha is an important component in the 2012 Viña Ardanza Reserva, where it represents 20% of the blend (the rest is, of course, Tempranillo). 2011 was a difficult vintage for Garnacha, so Viña Ardanza was not produced that year and they jumped from 2010, which had the mention ""Selección Especial,"" to 2012, where it returns to the regular Reserva. The wine is a prototype of polished and aged Rioja with a ruby color with some orange and a developed nose with subtle aromas of decayed leaves, sweet spices and some cherries in liqueur even, quite complex and harmonious. The palate is velvety but rich, with resolved tannins and a fine chalky mouthfeel, sleek and elegant, terribly balanced. The flavors are pure and defined, and there is an overall sense of harmony that I like very much. Brilliant Ardanza! Warming, nutty, complex Rioja with layers of fruit and a softness of dark cherry fruit on the palate. Has soft tannins and is elegantly poised, with a long, savory finish. COMMENTARY: The 2012 La Rioja Alta Viña Ardanza Reserva is generous and elevated on the palate.

989,Chateau Pavie,2012,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,409,14,0.0,0,"This shows incredible depth and density for the vintage with dark berry, dark chocolate, spice and chalk character. Full body, firm and velvety tannins and a long and powerful finish. Needs five or six years to soften. Try in 2020. A beauty, with rich and supple plum and blackberry confiture notes that stream along over a dense but velvety structure. The licorice and toast aspect is more restrained here, and there are long, cool menthol, apple wood and earth accents through the finish. The 2012 Pavie celebrates its reclassification and upgrade to Class A St.-Emilion by sporting a new black label with gold print. Fortunately, every Pavie has benefitted since Perse began a complete makeover of this estate in 1998. From 47-year-old vines, the 2012 has an inky purple color, judicious toasty oak in the nose interwoven with copious blackberry and blackcurrant fruit, Christmas spices, as well as licorice and graphite. Full-bodied, rich and moderately tannic, it will require 5-7 years of bottle age but should drink well for 20-30 years. Kudos to Chantal and Gerard Perse for their extraordinary commitment to quality, which is so evident in this more challenging vintage than some of the great years like 2009 and 2010. "

It’s going to gain a touch more complexity with short-term bottle age and keep for 15-20 years. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Black Label is deep garnet-purple in color and features wonderfully pure, vibrant notes of fresh, ripe blackberries, red and black currants and boysenberries plus suggestions of violets, dark chocolate, unsmoked cigars and pencil shavings.

While they sell most of their fruit, they keep some for their own bottlings, including this chardonnay. It’s a wine of simple beauty, opening to lemon and sweet pear flavors, the sunny fruit in the foreground. The acidity softens from apple-scented malic tension to hints of freshly churned butter, but it’s the lovely fruit that lasts. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Balletto Chardonnay is generous and elevated with a lasting finish on the palate.

It has ripe black fruit and licorice aromas and is Mediterranean, warm and comforting. It fermented with neutral yeasts in stainless steel and matured in second use French oak barrels for eight months. But the oaking is very light, and the wood feels very integrated, coming through as quite fruit-driven. "
995,El Enemigo Semillon,2018,Semillon,Argentina,28,0,3.8,35,"This has rich, lemon and lightly grassy aromas in a very fresh, pure and focused mode. Some fresh-pastry and chalky notes, too. The palate is succulent and piercing. Some smooth, lees-derived texture sits nicely around the fresh, lemon flavor with pastry-like resolve. Impressive textural complexity really makes this special.

997,Caves Roger Goulart Organic Cava Brut Reserva,2018,Vintage Sparkling Wine,Spain,19,0,3.6,21,"A dry, layered cava with dry lemon, cooked apple and some pear. Bread dough, too. It’s full-bodied and creamy-textured. 91 POINTS, WILFRED WONG. (Tasted: April 15, 2022, San Rafael, CA, USA) COMMENTARY: The 2018 Roger Goulart Brut Reserva is fresh, bright, and complex. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of tart apples and a suggestion of yeastiness. Enjoy it with Hamachi sashimi. (Tasted: April 15, 2022, San Francisco, CA) "
998,Guido Porro Vigna Lazzairasco Barolo,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,56,0,0.0,0,"From a proprietary vineyard site, the Guido Porro 2018 Barolo V. Lazzairasco starts off on a dry note. This expression never fully blossoms to those pretty tones of violet and lavender that we saw in some of the other releases from this producer. There is elegance and grace here, all backed by accessible tannins and a near-term drinking style. "
999,Grgich Hills Estate Yountville Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,189,14.5,0.0,0,"The medium to full-bodied 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Yountville Old Vine leads with scents of cassis, mint, dark chocolate and loamy earth. There's enough oak to lend supporting structure, but it doesn't dominate the olfactory or gustatory facets of this wine, which is ripe and concentrated but also streamlined and silky, ending in a lingering, savory and complex finish. Baked blueberries, blackcurrants, ripe blackberries, nutmeg, licorice and peppercorns on the nose. Some ink and oyster shell too. Full-bodied, concentrated and compact with a dense core of black fruit supported by firm tannins. From organically grown grapes. Drink from 2023. One of the clear standouts here is the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Yountville Selection, which has a concentrated, slightly rustic, yet still enjoyable and character-filled style, and it’s clearly well-made. Dark fruits, sous bois, tobacco, and damp earth all define the bouquet, and it’s medium to full-bodied, with firm tannins and good acidity. It should have 15 years of longevity. Ripe cassis, clove, cigar box, toast aromas. Fine tannins, bright acidity and good concentration of blackcurrant fruit with a spicy finish. Blend 90% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petit Verdot "
1000,Dow's Vintage Port,2017,Port,Portugal,119,20,4.6,5,"Pure grape aromas that remind me of fermenting must but then goes to stems and dried flowers. Full-bodied, medium sweet with fine-grained tannins that coat your palate. Powerful and muscular yet remains agile and beautiful. Grows on your palate. Wonderful ripe fruit in the middle palate. Try after 2030. A dense, thickly textured version, dripping with warm salted licorice, tar and açaí paste notes, while plum and blueberry pâte de fruit, chai spice and chocolate elements fill in behind. Lots of brambly grip flows underneath. Shows a very sappy feel on the finish. Best from 2035 through 2055. This is a dry while also floral wine, perfumed and enticing with its juicy acidity. At the same time, the structure is very present, showing power and dark black fruits. The balance is coming together with the rich fruits and tannins melding into one. Drink from 2028. This 2017 has all the markers of a legendary Taylor Port—scents of green fig, the complex tannic impact of schist, the consternating sense of elegance in the face of massive structural power. David Guimaraens bases this wine on fruit from the Quinta de Vargellas, an estate on the south bank of the river in the arid Douro Superior. In our tastings, it came after several 2017s that were sourced from vineyards on the north bank, closer to Pinhão, and, while it would be simplistic to consider this a definitive difference (there are many exposures in each quinta, and other quinta parcels in the blends), there was a stark shift from the blackness of those wines to the sour-cherry impression of this wine, and its floral fraise des bois notes. Those flavors keep pushing up against the dark shadows of the wine’s schist tannins, an undulating wake of red fruit and minerals that carries the wine’s muscular power into memory. "
1001,Biscaye Baie Cotes de Gascogne Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,France,21,11.5,3.8,80,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Biscaye Baie Sauvignon Blanc is authentic to the grape variety and where the grapes were grown. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits aromas and flavors of rustic spices, Old World earthiness, and grapefruit peel. Enjoy it with steamed mussels. (Tasted: April 21, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Green apples, elderflowers, gooseberries and asparagus on the nose. Medium-bodied with bright acidity and a crisp, fruity and tropical palate. "
1002,Rhys Vineyards Alpine Vineyard Pinot Noir,2006,Pinot Noir,California,99,0,0.0,0,"The Rhys 2006 Pinot Noir Alpine Vineyard is a structured, now somewhat backward style of Pinot Noir with deep ruby color, notes of spring flowers, black cherries, dusty, loamy soil nuances, and some underbrush. The wine is deep, layered, but also formidably structured for Pinot, with good acidity and high tannins. Give this wine another 2 years of bottle age and watch it evolve over the following decade or more. An herb-infused blue and red berry fruit nose that is less obviously ripe than that of the Hillside Cuvée leads to delicious and seriously complex medium-bodied flavors that culminate in a firmly structured finish of impressive length. This is delicious yet reserved and clearly built to age over the medium term. "
1003,Paitin Barbaresco Sori Paitin Serraboella,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,68,14,0.0,0,"The family that owns the Paitin estate lost its patriarch, Secondo Pasquero Elia, as this wine was being readied for release, and he would have been proud of the way this turned out. The 2018 Barbaresco Serraboella Sorì Paitin is glossy and polished with a super fine and delicate quality of fruit. It just glides over the palate as if it were on skates. That beautiful forward momentum is driven by light cassis, dried cherry, iron skillet, candied orange peel and crushed flowers. The finish is exceptionally smooth and elegant. Complimenti. A beefy red, this offers tar, cherry, plum and resin flavors, backed by dense tannins. This is compact and dry on the long finish, but there's ample fruit. Dried red-cherry and berry aromas and flavors with hints of flowers, dried mushrooms and tobacco. There’s a dry-ash note, too, which follows through to the palate and seems to provide the firm tannins with a dry, powdery coating. Medium-bodied with an intense, rather unyielding feel to this now. It will take several years to unwind. Try in 2024. "
1004,Pieropan Soave Classico,2021,Garganega,Italy,23,12,4.0,22,"A vibrant, medium-bodied white with aromas of lemon, green apple, pineapple, elder flowers and lime curd.

1005,Chateau De Berne Inspiration Cotes de Provence Rose,2021,Rosé,France,22,12.5,4.0,22,"Baked pear, fig, and tangerine perfume the glass. Ripe, Delicious apple and salted rose petals confirm a succulent, juicy persona. Aptly named, this pink is and should be an inspiration for it peach, wet slate, and floral beauty. This classically mouthwatering rosé is a blend of Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah. With its red berry flavors balanced by the wine's lively acidity, this is fruity, juicy and ready to drink. "
1006,Henriot Brut Souverain (1.5 Liter,Magnum),Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,99,12,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The Henriot Brut Souverain stands tall as one of Champagne's most consistent and high-quality non-vintage brut. TASTING NOTES: This wine hits on all cylinders. Its lively and enticing aromas and flavors of tart apple and bracing minerality are more lovely with its light touch of yeastiness. Pair it with longneck clam sashimi. (Tasted: March 14, 2019, San Francisco, CA) Toasty nose. Well-mannered with a creamy mousse, an impressive light texture, bready flavours and light mineral notes on the finish. A crisp and minerally Champagne, with well-cut acidity and a lightly chalky texture that frames flavors of crunchy pear and lemon sorbet with accents of oyster shell, pickled ginger and toasted brioche. Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier. Drink now. Baked raspberries, pears, figs, pastries, orange curd and praline make for a rich and ripe nose. Medium-bodied with soft bubbles on the palate and fresh acidity. Supple and broad with creamy pastry and mixed-berry notes. Blend of 45% pinot noir, 40% chardonnay and 15% pinot meunier. 2015 base vintage with 40% reserve wines. 6g/l dosage. Drink now Charming and expressive, the latest release of Henriot's NV Brut Souverain offers up aromas of nectarine, citrus zest, freshly baked bread and dried white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, pillowy and seamless, with a pinpoint mousse and lively acids, it concludes with a delicately mineral finish. "
1007,Gaja Costa Russi (1.5 Liter Magnum),2009,Nebbiolo,Italy,639,0,0.0,0,"The overt fruit and depth typical of Costa Russi comes through in spades in the 2009. Plums, black cherries, chocolate and new leather form the core of this round, expressive Costa Russi. As beautiful as this is, the 2009 remains deeply marked by the vintage. There is plenty of beauty and richness in the glass, but not quite the sheer visceral thrill of the very best Costa Russis. Although I wouldn't open any of the 2009 single-vineyard wines in the near-term, the Costa Russi is the most expressive of the three. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2029. Wonderful aromas of crushed cherries, peaches, and ripe strawberries follow through to a full body, with chewy tannins and a mineral and floral aftertaste. Perfumed and pure, this red delivers floral, berry and spice flavors on a harmonious frame. There's a touch of licorice as this tightens up on the finish. "

1009,Schrader Monastery Block To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,419,0,0.0,0,"A fine, effusive quality from the sandalwood, violets, black pepper and blackberry concentrate. Quite a denser and more muscular expression, yet you won’t feel any chew from the tannins, as they melt into the dark fruit. Long and focused.  Revealing a vivid purple hue as well as a powerful, more black-fruited, iron, tobacco, and scorched earth-like aromatic profile, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon To Kalon Vineyard Monastery Block is full-bodied, has a rich, powerful attack, great mid-palate density, and brilliant tannins. Coming from a famous block located on the western side of this great vineyard, brought up in new barrels, it's another 2019 that has a rounded, supple, approachable style while also bringing impressive density, depth, and structure. A dark and winey style, with loads of plum, blackberry and black currant preserves tumbling through, enlivened with apple wood, anise and bramble along the way. The finish is underscored by a swath of loam and tar but the fruit keeps the upper hand, ending with a flourish of additional spice, incense and iron. A wine that flaunts it—because it can. Best from 2024 "
1010,Domaine Tawse Gevrey-Chambertin Lavaux St Jacques Premier Cru,2017,Pinot Noir,France,159,13,0.0,0,"The 2017 Gevrey-Chambertin Lavaux St-Jacques 1er Cru has a well-defined bouquet of brambly red fruit, sous-bois and briary notes, gaining precision with each swirl of the glass. The palate is medium-bodied, taut and fresh, with fine-grained tannins and fine poise. I appreciate the backbone, and there is plenty of nascent energy palpable on the finish. A fabulous 2017 from Tawse. Tasted blind at the Burgfest 2017 tasting. Best After 2023 "
1011,Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue Musigny Vieilles Vignes,1997,Pinot Noir,France,879,0,0.0,0,"Full red-ruby. Perfumed aromas of small red berries and exotic, pungent baking spices. Wonderful sappy sweetness and intensity but quite dense and closed in on itself. Superb natural acids brighten and carry the fruit through to a very long, very subtle finish. Tannins are thoroughly buffered by flesh. The '96 will ultimately surpass this bottle, but the '97 may give more pleasure for the next decade. "
1012,Calera Jensen Vineyard Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,99,14.5,0.0,0,"Rugged cherry aromas meet with earth herbs, star anise and gamy charcuterie on the nose of this bottling, which was grown in true limestone at 2,200 feet. That rugged character rolls through the palate, featuring wild plums, salted meat, bay leaf and wood oil, with enough texture and acidity to last awhile. Very fresh, featuring raspberry, blood orange and mulberry fruit that's well-defined and backed by mouthwatering acidity. Offers rose petal and savory notes along the way. A nice piercing minerality extends the finish. Best from 2023 through 2032. "
1013,Honig Reserve Sauvignon Blanc Rutherford,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,California,38,14.1,0.0,0,"Lots of crushed stone, dried pineapple and peach on the nose and palate. Full-bodied and layered, with a dense fruit and a creamy-textured and crunchy finish. Rather chunky, but fresh. Drink now. "

The lighter, brighter style of this is true to the character of the vintage, but here it’s been well-handled. All in balance.  The Paolo Scavino 2018 Barolo is a pretty wine with sweet primary intensity that appears as tart cherry and dried raspberry. With Enrico Scavino's signature on the front label, this is a classic package with silky tannins and a long, polished mouthfeel. Fruit comes from multiple vineyard sites across the appellation. Best After 2024 "
1020,Robert Craig Cellars Affinity Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,70,14.8,0.0,0,"A perfumed nose of mulberries, plums, cedar, dried herbs, forest floor and cigar box. Full body with firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Balanced, structured and focused. Drink from 2023. I've always loved this wine, and the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Affinity is another solid vintage for the estate. Lots of currants, blackberries, smoked herbs, graphite, and charcoal notes emerge from the glass, and it's medium-bodied, with a supple, elegant texture and outstanding length. It's a classic, impeccably made Cabernet to enjoy any time over the coming 10-15 years. "
1021,Villa Sandi Il Fresco,Prosecco,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Italy,16,11,4.3,147,"Supple bubbles keep this wine lively, zipping away the sweetness and bringing out lemon-lime and green-apple flavors. A clean, pleasantly sweet sparkler for grilled prawns with fruit salsa. "
1022,Chateau Pape Clement (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,189,14,0.0,0,"As to the Grand Vin 2019 Château Pape Clement, it reveals a dense purple hue to go with stunning aromatics of crème de cassis, graphite, lead pencils shavings, scorched earth, and tobacco. Beautifully balanced, with flawless tannins, this full-bodied Pessac has that rare mix of elegance and power, a great mid-palate, and again, perfect balance. It's one of the gems of the vintage and has some accessibility today given its purity and balance, yet deserves 4-5 years of bottle age and will cruise for 20-25 years or more in cold cellars. The blend is equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, brought up in two-thirds new French oak. Best After 2026 Crushed-stone and berry aromas with some blackberry and black-tea character. Just a touch of smokiness. Sweet fruit, too. This is so refined, subtle, and beautiful for Pape with full body, ultra-fine tannins and a succulent finish. The center-palate is dense and complete. Goes on for minutes. So subtle and refined, focused and classy. Best from 2026. The 2019 Pape Clément has turned out well in bottle, delivering a rich bouquet of cherries, blackcurrants, plum liqueur and blackberries mingled with notions of burning embers, licorice and a nicely integrated framing of new oak. Full-bodied, deep and concentrated, it's a layered, fleshy wine, with a deep core of ripe but lively fruit, plenty of powdery tannin and a long, expansive, discreetly heady finish. This is a powerful, dramatic Pessac with a transatlantic accent and will drink well with only a few years' bottle age Best After 2026 Quite rich, with an exotic hint to the boysenberry, plum and mulberry fruit flavors, which are carried by a velvety structure. Features a very stylish backdrop of apple wood, anise and fruitcake notes that adds more bling. This doesn't have the drive for serious cellaring, but it's still pretty gorgeous. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Best from 2023 COMMENTARY: Chateau Pape Clement is one of the most heralded Pessac-Léognan chateaux. The 2019 vintage is powerful and elevated.

Medium-to full-bodied with plush tannins and savory fruit character. Polished and structured, with notes of chocolate and minerals to close. Drink of hold. The 2018 Reserva, a blend of Tempranillo with 9% Graciano, still feels quite oaky after 15 months in French and American oak barrels, half of each. It has good ripeness for a cooler vintage, at 14.1% alcohol, and has a creamy mouthfeel with tannins and plenty of oak-related flavors in the finish. For fans of oaky modern Rioja.

1033,Bindi Wines Kostas Rind Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,Australia,79,0,0.0,0,"The vines for this wine were 30 years old in 2018, 3.7 acres of chardonnay planted in volcanic soils with some quartz (Michael Dhillon uses the most quartz-rich sector of the vineyard for his Quartz Chardonnay, also recommended here). Spontaneously fermented and aged in French oak barrels (25 percent new), this wine completely melds that oak influence into its nuanced depths of flavor—quince and white cranberry, some ginger and lime, all of it coming together in a complexity that feels naked and clean, with the petrichor scent of a cooling rain. An exciting New World chardonnay, expressing its soil with delicacy and precision. Very rich here with attractively flinty, peach and lemon aromas that lead to a powerful and fresh palate with a sleek, fluid and very juicy impression. Great balance. "
1034,SYLTBAR Mr.,Prosecco,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Italy,19,11.5,4.3,83,"COMMENTARY: Prosecco? What does name meant to us? Is this simply a light and breezy sparkling wine? Or is this in which we should stand up and take more seriously. I have down many glasses of these wines over the decades, and now see it has become more and more serious as a wine that should be at the top of our shopping list. The Syltbar (pronounced zult-bar or sit-bar) Il Concerto Prosecco is refreshingly delightful. TASTING NOTES: Bright, easy, and crisp and refreshing, this is a beautiful and fine bubbly. Its aromas and flavors of tart apples and brisk minerality followed by its crisp finish make it a perfect aperitif wine. For an added plus, this wine has only 49 calories per 6 ounces.

1038,Castello di Bossi Chianti Classico,2019,Sangiovese,Italy,25,14,3.6,13,"Aromas of blueberries, plums, roasted meat and dried herbs. Medium-to full-bodied with firm tannins. Chewy and structured on the palate with chocolate notes on the flavorful finish. From organically grown grapes. Drink or hold.

1039,Fanti Vigne le Macchiarelle Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,2015,Sangiovese,Italy,130,15.5,0.0,0,"A polished style, with a light touch of new oak, evoking macerated cherry, strawberry, mineral, earth, wild herb and light spice flavors. Turns lean and dense, with a supporting layer of tannins on the finish. Features plenty in reserve. Best from 2025 through 2047. Purity and richness here, with beautiful depth and intensity. Dried berry, strawberry and smoke meat. It’s full-bodied with round, juicy tannins and a flavorful finish. Creamy texture. Spicy finish. Drink after 2022. The Fanti 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Vigna Le Macchiarelle stands apart from the estate's other two releases from 2016. This wine shows a heavier center of gravity for sure, with aromas of honey, ripe cherry, blackberry confit and even a touch of dried apricot. Those thicker aromas set in after the more fleeting aromas of crushed limestone and smoke lift and eventually disappear. As a result, I found these results slightly monotone compared to the buoyant and bright 2016s. This is a wine to enjoy in the medium term next to a roast game hen. Planted in 1980 by Filippo Fanti, Macchiarelle is only produced in the best vintages from the estate’s oldest vines. The nose is grounded with cedar, forest floor, dried plum, and fresh tobacco. Gentle tannins and acidity contribute to a weightless mouthfeel. This is in a great place for enjoyment now or over the next ten years. "

Still purple-hued with maybe just a hint of lightening around the edges, the 2009 Château Ducru-Beaucaillou offers an incredible bouquet of black currants, white truffle, cassis, lead pencil shavings, tobacco, and a hint of flowers. A good portion of its baby fat has melted away, and it's full-bodied and elegant on the palate, with silky tannins, incredible depth of fruit, and a gorgeous finish. This is pure elegance and finesse paired with richness and texture. A quintessential Bordeaux, drink bottles any time over the coming 40-50 years. It actually reminds me of the 1982, only better! Deep garnet colored, the 2009 Ducru-Beaucaillou bursts from the glass with bombastic crème de cassis, black cherry compote and preserved plums notes followed by hints of menthol, hoisin, dusty soil and incense plus fragrant wafts of candied violets and baker’s chocolate. Full bodied, rich and spicy in the mouth, the palate offers a beautifully plush texture and bags of freshness, finishing long and layered. An absolute powerhouse! Rich, powerful and intense, this is still inky in colour at 10 years, barely out of the starting gate. It's a wonderful wine, full of pleasure, still fresh and young, with cinnamon and saffron spice, eucalyptus, menthol-edging, and drenched in dark, juicy fruits. Great stuff, with the clear ability to power on for decades. Features plenty of flash and sizzle, with gorgeous, inviting mocha, espresso and chocolate notes up front, backed by a dense core of plum sauce, cassis, blackberry puree and blueberry reduction accents. Long, showing terrific polish, with a lovely lingering loam note and a buried singed apple wood edge that keeps everything driving through the finish.  This is a rich, powerful, concentrated and well-structured wine, but in comparison to recent vintages (from 2014) this comes off slightly heavy on the mid-palate. However, I love the balance at the ripe and generous finish. Drink or hold. "
1042,Kendall-Jackson Vintner's Reserve Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,California,15,13.5,3.7,7,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Kendall-Jackson Vintner's Reserve Sauvignon Blanc is layered and nicely textured on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of dried herbs, earthy notes, and citrus peel. Try it with pan-fried oysters wrapped with bacon and topped with lemon slices.

1043,Juve & Camps Pinot Noir Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,Spain,18,12,3.9,176,"The NV Pinot Noir Brut Rose, a non-vintage sparkling wine from Pinot Noir grapes, which is quite dark-colored, displays a bright cherry red color with a showy nose of cherries, truffles and strawberry jam with a fresh, pungent palate, balanced acidity and flavors. Different, with a strong personality. It feels like a red sparkling wine, and quite good, by the way! I'd have it with some charcuterie. "
1044,Grgich Hills Estate Cabernet Sauvignon,2013,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,149,14.6,4.5,21,"Grgich Hills Estate 2013 CABERNET SAUVIGON, Napa Valley
Lots of blackberry, black cherry and blueberry aromas and
flavors. Full body, silky tannins and a long and flavorful finish. Rich plum and cassis with smooth texture and balanced flavors; clean, juicy and long. 12% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot, 4% Cabernet Franc. Blackcurrant and menthol aromas unfold onto generous rhubarb, charcoal and vanilla oak on the palate. It is sleek and supple with full fruit, but it is a little oaky now and needs time to integrate. Grgich Hills farms 62 acres of cabernet sauvignon, merlot and petit verdot at the north end of Yountville, on either side of Highway 29. Those organically farmed vines form the basis of this wine, with additional fruit from estate-grown vines in Rutherford and Calistoga. It has the fresh tannins of the 2013 vintage, firm and tight, their power shadowing the fruit in notes of cherry skin and bitter chocolate. Give this time to evolve. "
1045,Broadbent 10 Year Malmsey,Madeira,Madeira,Portugal,55,18.9,4.4,50,"The NV Malmsey 10 Year Old wafts from the glass with a rich, figgy bouquet of dried dates, demerara sugar, pecans and sultanas. On the palate, it's full-bodied, sweet and fleshy, with an ample, voluptuous profile and a generous core of somewhat grapey fruit, concluding with a creditably intense, expansive finish. This is a lusty, pleasure-bent Malmsey. The Madeira regulations say that 10-years old is the age of the youngest part of the blend. So this richly sweet Malmsey contains many older wines. These are shown in the old gold color, the proper citrus acidity and the dryness that goes with wood aging. At the end, though, the liquid honey flavors are dominant. The Broadbent 10 Years Old Malmsey Madeira explodes on the palate with a load of ripe raisins and sweet caramel. Long and ultra-sweet in the finish, this is best enjoyed with conversations.

1046,Vilmart & Cie Grand Cellier Brut Premier,Cru,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,79,12.5,0.0,0,"A mouthwatering Champagne that shows seamless integration of the plush and creamy mousse, rapierlike acidity and expressive range of peach, chopped nut, ripe green apple, star anise and honeysuckle aromas and flavors that persist on the long finish. Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This is a 70-30 blend of chardonnay and pinot noir grown in clay-limestone soils. The components come from harvests in 2014 through ’16, the wines aged 10 months in foudre. It’s spicy in its structure and lasting in its fruit, with flavors ranging from the red blush of pear skin to orange and dry pineapple. Powerful, generous and still tight, this should develop well over the next several years. The NV Brut Grand Cellier is a classy, super-polished wine from Vilmart. Bright, effusive aromatics and generous citrus flavors abound. Marzipan, chamomile, dried flowers and sage lend complexity to this beautifully defined edition of the Grand Cellier. Made from 70% Chardonnay and the remainder Pinot Noir, the NV Champagne Grand Cellier Brut was raised for 10 months in large foudre before spending 30 months sur latte. The nose is rounded and soft, with a delicate perfume of vanilla pastry, Anjou pear, and white flowers. The palate is rounded but dry, with citrus zest that lifts through the modest finish. Best After 2023. "
1047,San Felice Chianti Classico,2019,Sangiovese,Italy,18,13,4.1,22,"Plenty of sour-cherry and floral aromas with hints of orange peel. It’s medium-bodied with firm, silky tannins and a fresh, clean finish. Very typical Chianti Classico. Drink now. "
1048,Henschke Johann's Garden GSM,2019,Rhone Red Blends,Australia,69,14.5,0.0,0,"Superb freshness to this ripe and plush red, served up in a medium-weight style with blackberries, dark raspberries and cherries, as well as some stone fruit. The bright, ripe tannins are smoothly curled around plump raspberry, plum and dark-fleshed peach flavors. Drinks well now and for the next six years. Lifted pepper, floral and fruit nose, with a bright, nicely concentrated palate, a sweet fruit core and grainy tannins. Good length and has potential. Blend : 80% Grenache, 20% Mataro An 80-20 blend of Grenache and Mataro, the 2019 Johann's Garden is noticeably lighter in hue than the other reds in this year's Henschke lineup. That's not a bad thing, as the wine still boasts ample concentration and distinct Grenache-ness. Hints of resinous herbs, like rosemary and bay, appear on the nose, alongside hints of strawberries and red raspberries, while the medium to full-bodied palate is framed by soft tannins and built around a core of bright acids that linger mouthwateringly on the finish.

1051,Martin Ray Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,California,35,13.4,3.4,9,"Mouthwateringly intense aromas of salted butter and toast. Lemon curd, grilled pear, hazelnut and chalk, too.

1052,Black Cabra Malbec,2020,Malbec,Argentina,11,13.8,4.1,17,"Lots of rich, ripe fruit, but in a balanced and serious way. Full-bodied with medium, round and savory tannins and a delicious, juicy finish. Serious value. Drink or hold. "

1054,Foxen Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,79,14.4,0.0,0,"The 2019 Pinot Noir Julia's Vineyard is more elegant and finesse-driven, with a beautiful perfume of framboise, wild strawberries, violets, and sappy flowers. All about red fruits and flowers, it hits the palate with medium-bodied richness, a seamless, flawlessly balanced mouthfeel, good acidity, and just a hint of classic Santa Maria salinity on the finish. Aged 16 months in 21% new French oak, this brilliant Pinot Noir is up with the crème de la crème in the vintage. Scents of sea wrack and black raspberry lead in this plush pinot, from an older vineyard on Cambria’s benchland property that it shares with area wineries. It’s all plums, fleshy and a touch blunt but with a direct, crowd-pleasing lusciousness. Decant a bottle for duck. "
1055,Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona Brunello di Montalcino Pianrosso,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,100,15,0.0,0,"This full-bodied red starts off with aromas of leather, forest floor and camphor. Enveloping and structured, the palate shows a weightless concentration, featuring dried cherry, licorice, tobacco and a hint of orange zest framed in velvety tannins. Best After 2024 The Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Pianrosso shows nice balance and elegance, and it definitely shows the deft hand of the winemaking team in what was not an easy vintage by any stretch. This pretty wine delivers lots of fresh cherry and wild rose, with ferrous earthy, licorice and grilled herb; I also get bay leaf and rosemary sprig. Like the annata 2017 Brunello produced by this estate, the single-vineyard Brunello Pianrosso is distinguished by a sweet cherry note (plus a hefty 15% alcohol) that accompanies the wine from start to finish This is a beautifully crafted and polished Brunello for this vintage, with full body and creamy, lightly chewy tannins. Dark berries, walnuts and cedar with dried-flower undertones. Needs time to soften, but very pretty. Drink after 2024. This red exhibits sappy, concentrated flavors of cherry, currant, plum, tobacco and soy. Shows intensity mid palate, persisting on the firm, chalky finish. Best from 2025. Shows a ripe cherry flavor melted with hints of blood orange, supported by firm sticky tannins and crisp acidity. "
1056,Troublemaker Red,Blend,Other Red Blends,California,18,14.5,3.9,581,"This is a widely available, nonvintage blend of 54% Syrah, 15% Petite Sirah, 14% Grenache, 10% Mourvèdre and 7% Zinfandel. Aromas of caramelized black fruit, oak and black pepper lead into an extremely rich palate that’s loaded with vanilla, caramel, fudge and black cherry. "
1057,Frederic Esmonin Gevrey-Chambertin Estournelles St Jacques Premier Cru,2020,Pinot Noir,France,79,0,0.0,0,"Here too there is enough wood to point out suffusing the ripe nose of cool and ripe purple fruit, anise, earth and mineral reduction. The elegant, pure and lilting middle weight flavors danse across the palate on the beautifully textured, firm and serious finale where a touch of youthfully austerity gradually emerges. This is also worth considering. "
1058,Patz & Hall Hyde Vineyard Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,California,75,14.2,4.4,11,"Stewed black fruit fills a dense texture-packed core of tannin and pronounced oak in this exuberant wine, with moderately structured acidity lending a balanced approach. Blue fruit and a touch of vanilla meet the palate head-on, showing a lifted intensity and noticeable length. Powerful, taut and well-structured, with toasty accents to the dried raspberry and cherry tart flavors, followed by hints of cinnamon bark that linger on the minerally finish. "
1059,Miguel Torres Cordillera Carmenere,2018,Carmenere,Chile,19,14,4.4,25,"The 2018 Carménère Cordillera de Los Andes comes from hillsides first planted in 1998 in Peumo, Cachapoal, four-fifths aged for 12 months in almost all used barrels. Intense violet in color. Aromas of white pepper and green bell pepper dominate over herbs and candied blueberry, followed by an animal whiff. Juicy with soft tannins; the expression is relaxed, flavorful and direct, with the freshness accounting for a good part of the jovial feel.  "
1060,Jean-Marc Burgaud Morgon Les Charmes,2020,Gamay,France,25,0,3.8,14,"The 2020 Morgon Les Charmes wafts from the glass with aromas of cherries, cassis, sweet soil tones, violets and peonies. Medium to full-bodied, velvety and vibrant, with a fleshy core of fruit, ripe tannins and lively acids, it's nicely concentrated, concluding with a long, perfumed finish. I love the combination of ripeness and freshness in this sophisticated and very elegant Morgon, which does a very good job in hiding its substantial tannin structure. Quite a firm finish that will need some time to marry with the deep red-fruit character. Drinkable now, but best from 2024. 9 days maceration, bottled 15 May after ageing in concrete tanks. Deep purple without the pink rim. This is altogether more muscular, and indeed spicy, with very evident whole bunch character though on blacker fruit. The acidity is comparatively tamed.  "
1061,Patrick Piuze Chablis Vaulorent Premier Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,92,0,0.0,0,"This supple white is highlighted by apple, melon and green plum flavors, with accents of mineral and vanilla adding detail. Balanced and crisp, finishing on the bracing side. Drink now. "
1062,Borne of Fire Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,Washington,23,14.5,3.9,83,"Just bottled, the 100% varietal 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon has a juicy, fruit-forward, delicious style as well as notes of ripe black cherries, tobacco, and leafy herbs. With plenty of fruit, ripe tannins, and loads to love, drink it over the coming 5-7 years. "
1063,Diamond Creek Volcanic Hill Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,249,14,4.8,8,"Beautiful aromas of brambleberries and blueberries with some conifer and mushrooms. Floral, too. Medium to full body, very fine tannins and succulent fruit and spices. Extremely long and subtle. Glorious and refined now, but will be better with age. Try after 2022. The 2017 Volcanic Hill starts out on a woodsy, less-immediately fruity note on the nose, but, while it takes a few minutes to show it, it is well-endowed with the deep, very precise, cassis-like fruit of top-shelf Cabernet Sauvignon and unequivocally confirms it with its building, impressively extracted flavors. Most definitely not a wine that should be opened and poured before seven to ten years have passed, it is yet another classic from Diamond Creek that is destined to reach its twentieth anniversary with life and layered richness to spare. This 2017 Volcanic Hill is one of the sexiest cabernets I’ve tasted from California. To mitigate the possible smoke taint, Steinschriber bathed the grapes in a one-ton fermenter, then rinsed them in a half-ton bin with drainage holes in the bottom. This vintage of Volcanic Hill seemed a little beyond his control, but its wildness only adds to the irresistible beauty of the wine, maybe because the normally fierce tannins were tamed to the kind of rocky wild-blueberry skin richness that takes a Diamond Mountain wine into the pleasure sphere, both sensual and intellectual, of first-growth Bordeaux. Bold, featuring dark plum, fig and blackberry compote flavors that jump to the fore, quickly harnessed by singed juniper, warm earth and licorice root notes. Shows good grip for a 2017. Best from 2022 through 2040. "
1064,Domaine Henri Gouges Nuits-St-Georges Clos des Porrets St. Georges Premier Cru,2019,Pinot Noir,France,119,0,4.8,5,"Graphite, black cherry, blackberry and baking spices are the hallmarks of this opulent red, which is backed by a spine of dusty tannins that leave a tactile feel on the long finish. Best from 2024 through 2040. "
1065,Scott Harvey Vineyard 1869 Old Vine Zinfandel,2019,Zinfandel,California,49,14.9,0.0,0,"This gem from a 150-year-old vineyard is bold in aroma, ripe in flavor and well structured in terms of tannin. It is full in body and packed with fruit, offering blackberries, blueberries and black cherries along with mild woodsmoke and black-pepper nuances. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Scott Harvey Vineyard 1869 Old Vine Zinfandel is an excellent, full-flavored wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of licorice, dried earth, and oak.

1066,Beringer Knights Valley Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,70,14.5,4.2,9,"Aromas of black tea, blackberry and tobacco leaf. Full-bodied with velvety, slightly tense tannins. Lovely black-fruited palate with dried-flower and herb character. Roses, violets and sage. Nicely balanced and long. Lovely density in the center-palate. Beringer's 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve Knights Valley starts off life as a block selection from the huge vineyard's rockiest parcel, then gets trimmed down further in the winery by winnowing out lots and barrels that don't quite make the cut. The result is a wine that boasts lovely Cabernet florals and pretty cassis fruit. It's bigger, richer and fuller-bodied than the regular KV bottling, more concentrated, but also smoother, silkier and longer on the finish. The affordable price tag and widespread availability (5,717 cases produced) should make this a steakhouse staple. "
1067,Woodward Canyon Old Vines Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Washington,109,14.9,0.0,0,"The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Old Vines, which has been made since 1981, comes from a mix of Sagemoor, Weinbau, Champoux, and the Woodward Canyon Vineyards and was brought up in 100% new French oak. It has a beautiful perfume of cassis and mulberry fruit as well as notes of new leather, lead pencil shavings, exotic flowers, and spice. It's medium to full-bodied on the palate and shows the ripe, supple, seamless style of the vintage nicely. Made with 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Old Vines is lush and rich and exudes power and finesse without being overdone. Gobs of dark red and black fruit tones sway with delightful complexity, dried herbs and oak essence from the 100% new French oak barrels. Full-bodied, the wine is precise, focused and impeccably balanced with a long textured finish that begs me back for another sip. A black-fruited nose with notes of bark, bramble and charcoal. Full-bodied with fine, tight tannins. Vanilla and cedar coat the palate with a milk-chocolate finish. Very good concentration with sleek balance. Drink now. This wine is made in a ripe, luscious style. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, dried cherry, licorice, baking spice and blackberry are followed by full-bodied flavors. Polished tannins support it all. Fruit and barrel intertwine throughout. The finish lingers. It shows a lot of richness and class. Best after 2028. Cellar Selection "
1068,Chateau Pibran,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,39,14.5,0.0,0,"Lots of cassis, graphite, chalky minerality, and sappy herb notes emerge from the 2019 Château Pibran, a rich, medium to full-bodied, beautifully concentrated Pauillac. I love its purity of fruit, the balance is spot on, and the tannins, while present, are perfectly ripe and polished. It's not a blockbuster and shows the more elegant style of the vintage, but it's a gorgeous, classy Pauillac that will benefit from 4-6 years of bottle age and have 25+ of prime drinking. Best After 2026 Aromas of black cherries, blackberries, cloves, black tea, wet earth and graphite. Medium-to full-bodied with firm, smooth tannins. Nicely balanced, with a compact core of dark fruit. Best after 2025. The 2019 Pibran offers up aromas of plums, sweet berries, loamy soil and licorice. Medium to full-bodied, ample and velvety, with polished tannins and a succulent core of fruit, it's a charming, giving wine from a cooler site than Pichon Baron, with limestone soils and a higher proportion of Merlot in the blend.

1070,Bovio Barolo Arborina,2016,Nebbiolo,Italy,62,14.5,3.9,5,"A tight, complex red with mineral, pumice, cedar and dried-strawberry aromas and flavors. It’s medium-to full-bodied with tight, chewy tannins and a long, flavorful finish. Extremely long and tannic, yet polished. Drink after 2023 and onwards. The panoramic views from Arborina extend over most of the Barolo appellation with rolling hills and snowcapped Alps. The vines enjoy a sun-drenched position for most of the day. The Bovio 2016 Barolo Arborina draws its fruit from 45-year-old vines and shows extra intensity and definition that comes in part thanks to the advanced age of the plants. However, the wine also magically reflects the elegance of the site with delicate berry nuances followed by licorice, aniseed and crushed stone. Give this release of 3,300-bottles (at least) another five years of cellar aging. Aromas of exotic spice, botanical herb, camphor and whiffs of French oak emerge from the glass. Reflecting the nose, the youthfully austere palate offers cranberry, sour cherry, coconut and menthol alongside tightly wound close-grained tannins. Give it time to fully develop. Drink 2026–2036. "
1071,Dana Estates Vaso Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,98,14.9,4.5,5,"Gorgeous aromas of blackberries, currants and plums with some spices. Walnuts and chocolate, too.

So balanced and delicious. 90% cabernet sauvignon, 5% merlot, 4% malbec and 1% petite verdot. Drink or hold. The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Vaso is cut from the same cloth, offering beautiful purity and richness. It’s slightly more pure and darker than the spicier 2017 and has notes of cassis, redcurrants, dark chocolate, tobacco, and violets. Full-bodied on the palate, it has silky tannins, terrific overall balance, and just loads of character and charm. It’s in the running for the greatest Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon under $100. Best after 2022. "
1072,Tenimenti d'Alessandro Il Bosco Syrah,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,Italy,34,14,4.4,6,"This is a beautiful, complete syrah with blackberry, black-olive, light tar and mahogany character. It’s full and chewy, yet the tannins are round and attractive. Give it time to open and come together. Spicy at the end. Try after 2023. "
1073,Paul Pernot Puligny-Montrachet Champ Canet Premier Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,129,0,0.0,0,"Light colour with a green tint. This is discreet but with some power, especially at the back end.

1074,Roger Sabon Chateauneuf-du-Pape Reserve,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,54,14.5,0.0,0,"A dense, powerful red, with a vein of graphite coursing through sappy black fruit and melted licorice. Shows charred sandalwood and a bitter kick of herbs and iodine that offset the ripeness, with tannic grip through the smoky finish. Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. The 2020 Châteauneuf Du Pape Réserve is a similar blend of 80% Grenache and 10% each of Syrah and Mourvedre. Its deep ruby/plum hue is followed by notes of darker berries, chocolate, roasted herbs, and garrigue. Full-bodied, round, and opulent, with the vintage’s forward, incredibly charming style, it has the mid-palate depth as well as tannic structure to keep for 10-15 years, although I see no need to delay gratification. "
1075,Site Larner Vineyard Red,2018,Rhone Red Blends,California,54,0,0.0,0,"The 2018 Red Wine Larner Vineyard is Syrah-based but includes 17% Grenache and 4% Viognier, all fermented with 23% whole clusters and brought up in 50% new oak. Deep purple-colored, with fabulous notes of smoked blackberries, cassis, ground pepper, and violets, it's full-bodied and has a seamless texture, ripe tannins, and a great finish. It might be the finest wine I've tasted under this label. Aromas of blackberries, prunes, dried rosemary, smoke, grilled herbs and baking spices. It’s full-bodied with sleek tannins. Round and creamy with a savory, flavorful finish. Drink or hold. "
1076,Dry Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,California,20,14.1,4.4,8,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Dry Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc is on target in its varietal category.

1077,La Valentina Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,2019,Montepulciano,Italy,23,13.5,3.8,9,"Enticing nose of brambleberries, dried flowers and a light, bitter-orange note, following through to a lightly firm, medium-bodied palate with good fruit and balance. Drink now. "

1079,Newton The Puzzle,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,149,0,0.0,0,"Dried violets, potpourri, pine, blackcurrants and cloves on the nose. Ash, too. It’s medium-to full-bodied with firm, silky tannins. Layers of juicy blue and purple fruit and flowers. So sleek and refined. Builds on the palate. From organically grown fruit. Try from 2024. Lots to like here. This red has bouncy energy from the get-go, with spice-infused raspberry and red currant preserve flavors bouncing along with floral and briar notes. A cassis bush note pervades on the finish. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Mint and strawberry aromas, kirsch, sweet fruit with attractive savoury, herbal notes. Lots of tannic and acidic structure. Persistent aftertaste. "
1080,Fratelli Alessandria Barolo Monvigliero,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,115,15,0.0,0,"Heady aromas of camphor, rose petal and red forest berry come to the forefront along with whiffs of pipe tobacco and new leather. Full-bodied but refined and well-balanced, the savory palate features ripe Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and mint alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2026–2033. The 2018 Barolo Monvigliero shows a beautiful signature of pressed violets, rose garden, white stone, crushed peppercorn and grilled rosemary. The wine is smooth and soft in texture, yet it feels stitched up and firm at the back thanks to the support it gets from those balanced tannins. This wine should hold 20 years or more. A tight core of raspberries, minerals and oaky notes. Medium-bodied with fine, lightly abrasive tannins and a focused finish. Compact at the moment with a light feel to it. But it should expand with a little bottle age. Try from 2023. "
1081,Chateau Mouton Rothschild,2014,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,714,13,4.2,8,"Incredible iodine, oyster, currants, peat and cedar. Yet subtle. Full body, chewy yet polished tannins and great depth and complexity on the finish. I love the spice and blueberry character on the finish. Vibrant. A sexy style of Mouton. Try drinking this in 2022. Unquestionably one of the great wines in the vintage, the 2014 Mouton-Rothschild offers more flamboyance, depth, and texture than just about every other release out there. Crème de cassis, violets, lead pencil, and ample creamy oak notes all emerge from this incredibly sexy, concentrated 2014 that has a terrific mid-palate, sweet tannin, and a great, great finish. Not far off the incredible 2015, it can be enjoyed anytime over the coming 3-4 decades, although 3-5 years of bottle age should do it good. This delivers a large core of pure, unadorned cassis, accented by notes of anise, plum cake, mint and bitter plum
coulis. The core has serious heft, supported easily by a riveting iron spine that shows superb length through the
finish. A prodigious display of power and cut. Best from 2022 through 2040. The 2014 Mouton-Rothschild was closed at first when I tasted the wine in bottle with winemaker Philippe Dhalluin. But as it transpires, this First Growth is just toying with you. Initially quite understated, it responds to aeration like a young child peeking from around a corner and then running out, waving its hands. It suddenly hits you with gorgeous black cherries, bilberry, cedar and wilted rose petal. The palate is medium-bodied with a silky smooth entry. This is utterly seductive: a wine without a hair out of place. It is not as powerful or as complex as the 2015 Mouton-Rothschild, yet the precision and focus here is beguiling. It will require five to seven years to absorb the 100% new oak, then it will be an utterly delicious and to use a term employed at en primeur, ""cerebral"" First Growth that is destined to give two or three decades of pleasure. "
1082,Granbazan Etiqueta Ambar Albarino,2021,Albarino,Spain,26,12.5,3.7,7,"Aromas of green apple and yuzu waft from the glass. This wine is creamy on the palate, with flavors of grapefruit, pineapple, and orange blossom. A note of orange zest lingers beyond the finish. "
1083,Lavau Rasteau,2018,Rhone Red Blends,France,17,14.5,3.6,9,"Lots of black fruit with violets and berries. Spicy. Charcoal character, too. It’s full-bodied, chewy and polished. Very pretty. This blend of equal parts Syrah and Grenache balances Syrah's sharper, bramblier edges and piercing cassis flavors against the richness and suppleness of Grenache.

1084,Kettmeir Pinot Bianco,2020,Pinot Blanc,Italy,21,13,4.4,12,"A bit shy at first, but with aeration the caramelized-pear and fresh-nut aromas open up very nicely. A full-bodied dry pinot blanc for just 13% alcohol with some textural complexity through the long, fresh yet creamy finish. "

1086,Champagne Barons de Rothschild,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,53,12.5,4.0,48,"Lots of bread-dough and dried-apple character with lemon undertones. Roasted-nut and bread-dough undertones. Fine bubbles. Medium to full body. Flavorful finish. Drink now. A well-cut Champagne, with a fine bead, this offers a mouthwatering range of nectarine, salted almond, honeysuckle and biscuit flavors. Elegant, featuring a lightly spiced finish. "
1087,Saxum Broken Stones,2010,Rhone Red Blends,California,139,15.3,0.0,0,"Deceptively understated, offering a profile of crushed rock and mineral joined by dark berry and spice, with a beefy note on the finish. Firmly tannic. Syrah, Mourvèdre, Grenache and Petite Sirah. Drink now through 2024. "
1088,Gonet-Medeville Brut Tradition Premier,Cru,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,55,12.5,4.3,36,"Disgorged in November 2018, the new release of Gonet-Medeville's NV Brut Premier Cru Tradition is showing very well after a year on cork, offering up an expressive bouquet of honeyed peach, oatmeal, Meyer lemon and subtle hints of the nutty complexity to come with further aging. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, fleshy and generous, with terrific concentration, racy acids and a pinpoint mousse. Not only is this an excellent Champagne, but it's a remarkably good value, too. A harmonious Champagne, well-knit and chalky in texture, with flavors of white cherry, salted almond, cassis and blood orange peel. Creamy finish. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Drink now. "
1089,Pertinace Barbera d'Alba,2019,Barbera,Italy,18,14,3.8,15,"A well-judged, spicy and minerally edge to the clean red berries and cherries on the nose and palate. Medium-bodied, tight and clean with a lightly firm feel on the finish. Nicely done, and this should age well for a few years. Drink or hold. "
1090,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon,2005,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,400,14.5,0.0,0,"Almost sure to raise controversy with its involving aromas of leather, roasted coffee, scorched chocolate and herbs, this unique offering smacks ever so faintly of Syrah and may not fit the fruity Cabernet model, but its complexity is beyond any argument. It is smooth and supple in feel with plenty of palatal weight and a fine sense of polish, and its neatly fit spine of firm structural tannins is precisely the stuff of fine Cabernet. A few years of age should make a good thing better, and it has room enough for ten years of growth. "
1091,Domaine Jean Grivot Nuits-St-Georges Ronciere Premier Cru,2017,Pinot Noir,France,239,0,0.0,0,"Back to a normal crop in 2017 after a 50% hit in 2016, this is made in a Vosne-like style by the Grivots, even though the grapes come from the southern side of Nuits-St-Georges. Poised, supple and almost good to drink from the barrel, it has juicy, lip-smacking fruit, stylish 30% new wood and balancing acidity. Slightly more evolved in colour, prettily stemmy on the nose, floral with crushed tinned strawberries, which become fresher with air. A certain succulence, certainly some white pepper, attractive in its style. "
1092,Forman Cabernet Sauvignon (1.5 Liter Magnum),2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,239,14.9,0.0,0,"Forman's 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon is fabulous. Rich and beautifully layered in the glass, the 2017 has gorgeous depth and a touch of exoticism that is so appealing. Ripe red berry fruit, floral overtones and a touch of spice are all laced together. Just bottled, the 2017 is super impressive, even in the early going. This is an especially racy style for Ric Forman, and yet he clearly got every ounce of potential out of the year. "
1093,Dana Estates Onda Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,289,15,0.0,0,"Plenty of blue fruit, spices and cloves in the nose with red licorice and violets. Lilacs as well. Medium-bodied with polished, fine tannins. Black truffle and dark fruit. Pure and fine. Phenolics spread across the palate. So delicious now and can age beautifully. Comes mostly from Dana’s Crystal Spring. The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Onda is pure Cabernet Sauvignon cassis, graphite, lead pencil, and tobacco on the nose, and it reminds me of a great Saint-Julien from Bordeaux. Medium to full-bodied, straight, and focused, it shines on all accounts. It’s a beautiful Cabernet to drink over the coming 10-15 years. A rich, polished style, with waves of warmed cassis and plum sauce gliding through. Stays firmly grounded through the finish, with light alder, tobacco and warm earth hints providing nice textural contrast and additional range. Best from 2023. "

1095,Ferreira Dona Antonia 10 Year Tawny,Port,Port,Portugal,32,20,4.3,30,"Markedly low acidity here contributes to a voluptuous, sweeter style and seemingly fuller body: ripe, rolling, figgy and expressive – very pleasant indeed. This rich wine is balanced and ripe with spice, sweet sultana and raisin fruitiness and a light shot of acidity. The aftertaste brings out fresh red fruits that are cut by the spirit and acidity to leave a full feeling in the mouth. "

1097,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Fay Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,1999,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,234,0,0.0,0,"Entirely from a vineyard in the Stags Leap District, which is a little cooler than mid-Napa appellations. This gorgeous, sumptuous, fully ripened wine has aromas of blackcurrants, mushrooms, coffee and sage. In the mouth, it has classic cabernet flavors and structure. The tannins are a wonder, rich and thick but easy and delicious. A total delight to sip, and it will age, too. "
1098,Borsao Garnacha Seleccion,2020,Grenache,Spain,10,14.91,3.9,29,"A medium-bodied red with plum and strawberry character, as well as some cherry. Medium body, light tannins and a fruity finish. Garnacha. "
1099,Clos Apalta,2012,Bordeaux Red Blends,Chile,135,14,4.3,16,"One of my top red wine experiences of 2016, the 2012 Clos Apalta just sails onto the palate with seamless energy. Intense, yet stylish, this wine's tremendous persistence of red fruit and sweet oak starts out strong and continues through its long and smooth finish. Just starting to drink well. (Tasted: August 18, 2016, San Francisco, CA) Lusty notes of coconut, charcoal, vanilla and herbs grace core blackberry and cassis aromas. This is massive and widespread on the palate, but the key to its success is impeccable balance. Toasty, minty flavors of blackberry and cassis are chocolaty and lightly herbal, while the finish blends lushness, power, heft and smoky, herbal flavors that go on and on. Drink this Carmenère-led blend through 2024. A dense, ripe and powerful style, with concentrated flavors of dark plum, blackberry and chocolate. Very plush and creamy midpalate, with a rich finish loaded with espresso notes, along with medium-grained tannins. Carmenère, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The 2012 Clos Apalta started off a little closed, but with air, the spicy aromas seemed to dominate (cloves, black pepper); there are also lots of smoky notes over a core of ripe black fruit with a volatile hint. It feels young and greatly marked by its two years in new French oak barrels. The palate is still young and tannic, and the finish is a little dry. There's not a lot of fruit in there and it somehow feels like it lacks a bit in the mid palate. For fans of the style, but even though, you should wait to pull the cork. "
1100,Maddalena Rose,2021,Rosé,California,17,13.5,4.4,11,"A delicate shade in the glass, this bottling offers pink rose petal, chalk and light berry aromas on the nose. There's a firm grip to the palate, where bright grapefruit flavors meet with warmer strawberry and watermelon elements. "
1101,Chateau Marsau,2018,Merlot,France,36,14.5,3.8,29,"Beautifully pure cherry, berry, black-olive and lightly toasted coffee-bean aromas follow through to a full body with a lovely center palate and purity of fruit. Lots of fine tannins. Balanced and poised. Wonderful depth. Tiny production – only 20% of the normal production. Pure merlot. From organically grown grapes. Needs two or three years to come around. Try after 2022. "
1102,Louis Latour Criots-Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru,2017,Chardonnay,France,499,13.5,0.0,0,"Toasty aromas proclaim a young wine. Richness and ripe yellow fruits are balanced by the toast and freshness that shines through this concentrated wine. Its future is assured and it should not be drunk before 2023. A plump style, boasting pineapple, lemon, butter, spice and stone aromas and flavors. Offers fine acidity and settles into a lingering finish, with echoes of butterscotch and spice. Best from 2020 through 2030. 75 cases made, 20 cases imported. "
1103,Chateau Mouton Rothschild,1994,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,549,0,0.0,0,"Dark-colored, with intense aromas of blackberries, tar and spice, and toasted oak notes as well. Full-bodied, with very silky tannins and a chewy, ripe fruit-accented finish. An impressive Mouton. After less than persuasive performances in two potentially great years, 1989 and 1990, Mouton-Rothschild appears to have settled down, producing fine efforts in recent vintages, culminating with the enormously promising, unquestionably profound 1995. The 1994 appears to be the finest Mouton-Rothschild made following the 1986 and before the 1995's conception. The wine exhibits a dense, saturated purple color, followed by a classic Mouton nose of sweet black fruits intermingled with smoke, pain grillee, spice, and cedar. Medium to full-bodied, with outstanding concentration, a layered feel, plenty of tannin, and rich, concentrated fruit, this wine is similar to the fine 1988. By the way, the Dutch artist, Appel, has created a gorgeous label for the 1994. Although Mouton-Rothschild can be among the most inconsistent first-growths, when this estate gets everything right, the wine can be as compelling as any produced in Bordeaux. This is still youthful in appearance with dark ruby color. It sets an excellent example for the 1994 vintage with a spicy, toasty nose showing lots of black currants and tar. It's full-bodied, refined and chewy. "
1104,Girolamo Russo Feudo Etna Rosso,2018,Nerello Mascalese,Italy,79,14,0.0,0,"Aromas of damson jam, together with pronounced mineral and floral notes, marking this as a very terroir-driven red. Medium-to full-bodied with a layered texture of fruit and firm but not chewy tannins. Dense fruit and mineral elements vie for position, but pull together in the long finish. Quietly complex, well-structured red. Delicious even now, but patience until 2022 will be rewarded. Aromas suggesting wild berries, spice and Mediterranean scrub come to the forefront on this fragrant red. Savory and vibrant, the palate features juicy Morello cherry, raspberry and baking spice set against a backbone of firm acidity. Fine-grained tannins offer lithe support while a tangy mineral note suggesting oyster shell signals the close. Best after 2023. "
1105,Vaughn Duffy Russian River Valley Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,39,14.5,4.0,12,"Very attractive dark berries and cherries are wrapped in aromas of blueberries, subtle spices and violet flowers. The palate has a smooth, sleek and attractively fleshy feel with a concentrated yet approachable build into the long finish. Drink now. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Vaughn Duffy Wines Pinot Noir is lovely and a classic example of what the Russian River Valley can produce. TASTING NOTES: This wine shows up with excellent aromas and flavors of black fruit, dried leaves, earth, and oak shading. Pair it with a well-seasoned, oven-baked Porchetta. (Tasted: June 22, 2021, San Francisco, CA) This wine is textured, complex and rich—a good showcase for the appellation. Dense layers of dark cherry and strawberry complement the earthier tones of black tea, forest floor and rhubarb, ending in a robust finish of toasted oak "
1106,Chateau Fonplegade,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,49,14.5,0.0,0,"Plums, dark cherries, blueberries, cedar, amber, dried herbs and baking spices on the nose. Full-bodied with plush tannins. Structured, balanced and intense. It has a polished, rich core of dark and blue fruit and a long, flavorful finish. Wait for the oak spice to integrate. Drink from 2025. From a great terroir on the south-facing hillside just outside of the village, the 2019 Château Fonplégade has pretty notes of ripe black cherries, cassis, spring flowers, sandalwood, and classy oak. I love the nose, and while it's still young and relatively unevolved, it already has hints of complexity and nuance, and the purity is spot on. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, with a great mid-palate and sweet, velvety tannins, it already offers pleasure yet will benefit from 4-6 years of bottle age, and I'd be shocked if it didn't evolve nicely for at least 15-20 years. Best after 2026. Shows the thickly textured dark fruit of the vintage, with steeped plum and blackberry notes cruising through slowly, carried by alder, loam and tobacco threads. Gains nuance as it airs in the glass, showing light chalky minerality for energy and balance in the process. Approachable but no rush. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Drink now. Aromas of ripe cherries, licorice, crème de cassis, burning embers and loamy soil introduce the 2019 Fonplegade, a medium to full-bodied, muscular wine that's rich and powerful, reflecting its clay-rich soils. It's a fleshy, generous wine that represents a fine success in a more impactful style. Best after 2025. "
1107,Tait The Ball Buster,2018,Other Red Blends,Australia,22,15.9,4.2,43,"Opaque ruby. Smoke-accented aromas of ripe dark berries, pungent flowers and vanilla, along with a hint of white pepper that adds spicy lift. Concentrated, expansive cherry liqueur, blackberry and fruitcake flavors become more energetic as the wine opens up. Round, well-knit tannins frame the appealingly sweet finish, which hangs on with impressive, dark fruit-dominated persistence. "
1108,Yalumba Y Series Viognier,2021,Viognier,Australia,15,13.5,3.8,34,"Despite being Yalumba’s entrylevel Viognier, this is one of its most delicious white offerings. Highly aromatic, it wafts a perfume of honeysuckle, orchard blossom and fuzzy peach skin. The palate is more viscous than the nose implies, but there’s enough acidity to keep it fresh. Peach and lemon flavors linger on the finish. Drink with Thai curry or a similarly bold Southeast Asian dish. "
1109,Pietranera Brunello di Montalcino,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,45,14,3.9,14,"Blackberry, walnut, lavender and cedar aromas with some sandalwood. Full-bodied and layered with fine, silky tannins and pretty purity and focus at the finish. Give this time to come together and mellow. Try after 2023. Tobacco, underbrush and red-skinned fruit aromas unfold in the glass. The juicy, medium bodied palate features cranberry, star anise and white pepper alongside polished tannin's. Drink 2023–2030.  "

It’s full-bodied and very sweet with focus, density and length. Fruity, yet pleasantly earthy. Drink now and enjoy. The wine is rich, ripe and fruity with good acidity as well as a bite of spirit and old-wood aging. It is well balanced, keeping the freshness of a 10-Year-Old while also showing good signs of its wood aging. Just what a 10-Year-Old should be. This has a zesty, sweet floral aroma, with delicate, well-spiced flavors of apple tart, flan and cocoa powder. The plush, mouthfilling finish of cream, vanilla and raspberry is fresh and balanced. Drink now. Rich toffee aromas with a soft, velvety mouthfeel. Chocolate and fruit cake on the palate. Well balanced sweetness and a lively acidity. A persistent, slightly spicy finish.

Moore Vineyard Zinfandel,2019,Zinfandel,California,61,14.8,0.0,0,"From a beautiful, historic site in the appellation, this red is grippy and earthy, with highlights of cedar and cigar that hit the palate first. It delivers full-bodied berry-pie notes on the midpalate, with dustings of tannin and oak spice. An alluring nose of black fruit and spice with a dried-citrus undertone. Medium-bodied with nice freshness and energy. Silky, slightly tight tannins are well connected to the crushed black and blue fruit. Minerals, too. "

1116,Dr. Loosen Erdener Treppchen Riesling Spatlese,2021,Riesling,Germany,31,8,0.0,0,"Very anise on the expressive nose, then a compact and racy palate with a ton of white tree fruits. Very vinous and well-structured, this is seriously on the dry side for a category often regarded as medium-sweet. Very long, crushed stone finish. Drink or hold. "
1117,Domaine de la Solitude Cotes Du Rhone Red,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,16,0,4.0,10,"Tons of black-cherry and ripe-blackberry fruit, but not a jot overripe. This is a bold and substantial wine for the appellation, thanks to the healthy dose of soft tannin. Plenty of licorice and spice, plus a hint of tar at the long finish. Carries 14% alcohol effortlessly! A GSM blend of 50% grenache, 40% syrah and 10% Mourvèdre. Drink now. "
1118,Bouchard Aine & Fils Clos de la Roche,2011,Pinot Noir,France,240,13,0.0,0,"A deep, satisfying, red-fruited wine, this is grand cru as extreme sport, the tannins gripping and giving way through a long finish. Voluptuous in texture and powerful in its grip, this is one of the best Bouchard Aîné wines we’ve tasted.A deep, satisfying, red-fruited wine, this is grand cru as extreme sport, the tannins gripping and giving way through a long finish. Voluptuous in texture and powerful in its grip, this is one of the best Bouchard Aîné wines we’ve tasted. This is an attractive, fast-maturing wine with soft tannins, ripe fruits and a juicy, perfumed acidity. It has considerable weight and concentration, along with firm red-plum and berry flavors. It's an elegant wine that should be drunk from 2017. "
1119,Chateau Puygueraud Blanc,2019,Bordeaux White Blends,France,19,13.5,4.2,9,"Lovely ripe and expressive nose, quite full and exotic - lemon, lime, mandarin, grapefruit and pineapple - such complexity on the nose. This is so alive, really high acidity balanced by lush juicy fruit. Round but light on the palate, such energy and verve with good background of salinity and touch of oak adding definition and structure. This is fun and fruit forward. A bright wine that wants to come out and play. But it's the sweet, honeyed edge of the fruit that's the best, it captures interest and holds it all the way. Almost a touch of lemon sherbert on the end. Drink now for high acid and upfront freshness or hold on to. The 2019 Château Puygueraud Blanc is terrific, with a racy, vibrant, tart style that makes it a joy to drink today. Bright lemon, citrus, and grapefruit notes define the bouquet, and it's medium-bodied, balanced, and has a clean, dry finish. "

COMMENTARY: The Non-Vintage Vincent Crémant de Bourgogne Brut is one the world's most reliable wines in the sparkling wine category under $30.

1125,Sine Qua Non Grenache Testa dei Cherubini,2014,Grenache,California,549,16,0.0,0,"As with the extended aged Syrah release, the 2014 Grenache Testa Dei Cherubini (80% Grenache, 15.5% Syrah, and the rest Petite Sirah and Viognier) comes all from the estate Eleven Confessions Vineyard in the Sta. Rita Hills and spent just under 38 months in 25% new French oak, with the balance in neutral barrels (varying sizes). Layers of black raspberry, cassis, white chocolate, white flowers, and Asian spices flow to a full-bodied, supple, powerful Grenache that has silky, silky tannins, a seamless texture, no hard edges, and a finish that won’t quit. It’s already approachable, yet in my experience, this extended élevage results in a very stable wine, and I suspect this beauty will have another two decades of longevity. The 2014 Grenache Testa dei Cherubini saw fully 37.5 months in wood, some 25% new, but its influence is imperceptible; the wine is strikingly pure and vibrant. Krankl commented that the longer the wines spend in barrel, the more slowly they seem to evolve in bottle. Unfurling in the glass with aromas of juicy red cherries, peonies and plums, it's initially quite reserved, becoming more expressive with air. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, layered and very concentrated, with strikingly fine-grained, revolved tannins, juicy acids and impressive length and depth. Like the 2015 Le Chemin Vers l'Hérésie also reviewed in this report, it's remarkably pure and integrated and ranks as one of the finest Grenache bottlings I've tasted from Sine Qua Non. It's also one wine that will clearly benefit from bottle age, no matter how tempting it may be when it's released in November of this year. "
1126,Sine Qua Non This Is Not An Exit Grenache (Esto No Es una Salida),2009,Grenache,California,599,15.5,0.0,0,"More open, upfront and sexy, the 2009 Grenache This is Not an Exit is comprised of 79% Grenache, 15% Syrah, 3% Viognier and 3% Roussanne that spent 31 months in roughly 35% new French oak. Showing overflowing richness, with notions of incense, spice cake, potpourri and creamy raspberry fruit, it is a full-bodied, voluptuous and decadent Grenache geared for drinking over the coming decade or so. Drink now-2023. Exhibits a complex note of raspberry-mocha tort, with layers of flavors and a range of textures, from fleshy to firm. This is gripping on the finish, where the tannins keeps the flavors intact. Drink now through 2024. "
1127,Schiopetto Pinot Grigio,2018,Pinot Gris/Grigio,Italy,29,13,4.0,41,"Shows wonderful clarity and intensity with dried lemons, apples, peaches, peach pit and stone character. Medium to full body. Crisp and bright in a rich year.  Aromas evoking hawthorn and cantaloupe mingle with scents of Alpine herb on this savory, structured Pinot Grigio. On the rounded palate, fresh acidity lifts mature pear, Rennet apple and a hint of nectarine. It closes on a saline note The Schiopetto 2018 Collio Pinot Grigio opens to a medium rich and fragrant bouquet with citrus, preserved lemon, saffron and dried rose. Compared to many of its commercial peers, this wine shows elaborate aromatic layering. And instead of the standard citrus and dried grass, this expression offers honey-like tones and general smoothness. You could pair it with grilled shrimp in a light curry sauce. "
1128,Yalumba The Virgilius Eden Valley Viognier,2019,Viognier,Australia,51,13.5,0.0,0,"Yalumba has firmly positioned itself at the pointy end of the Australian viognier hierarchy with its Virgilius. It's a style more in line with the wines of the northern Rhône than the usual overtly apricotty numbers we often see from the Antipodes. Steely and textural with savoury-shaped stone fruits and a light dusting of apricot and citrus fruits, along with notes of marzipan, dried honey and light ginger spice. It boasts a savoury, stony palate shape and a light tweak of phenolics on the finish, which is fruit-pure and enduring. The 2019 The Virgilius Viognier is generally accepted as being one of the best Viogniers in the country (there are a handful of wines in this group), and it manages a range of briny acidity and chalky phenolics balanced on a fulcrum of sweet summer apricot, white flowers and green apples. Really smart. This has a complex nose of burnt lemon, grapefruit, beeswax, dried jasmine, chamomile, salted lime slices and pineapple. It’s medium- to full-bodied with sleek, saline layers. Bright acidity. Fresh and elegant. "
1129,Domaine Fourrier Gevrey-Chambertin Vieilles Vignes (stained label),2008,Pinot Noir,France,309,0,0.0,0,"The 2008 Gevrey-Chambertin is an utterly impeccable, refined wine graced with exquisite layers of intensely perfumed dark red fruit.

1130,Domaine de Marcoux Lirac La Lorentine,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,31,15.5,0.0,0,"The 2019 Lirac La Lorentine is another successful vintage, dominated by scents of purple raspberries and hints of garrigue and blueberries. Full-bodied and richly textured, it's a blend of foudre-aged Syrah and tank-aged Grenache and Mourvèdre, all grown on largely calcareous soils. It should drink well for at least a decade. Best after 2023 Fresh and pure, with a lovely beam of cassis, melted red licorice and gentle roasted alder notes gliding through in unison. Finishes with a nice tug of warm earth. Drink now. "
1131,Philippe Colin Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,2018,Chardonnay,France,630,0,0.0,0,"The 2018 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru has a very classy bouquet, very focused and detailed with crushed rocks and yellow flowers gently unfolding in the glass. The palate is very well balanced with a peppery opening. Great depth and intensity here as it fans out gloriously towards the finish, clearly a sophisticated Chevalier with a very persistent aftertaste. Maybe even better than I estimated from barrel. Delightful clear bright colour. Fresh fruit on the nose, delicious potential. This is extremely pure and very fine. Not massive. White flowers as well as fruit, Chablis Blanchot comes to Chevalier-Montrachet, with a saline touch to finish. Discreet and very long. Really rather gorgeous with quite a sensual aftertaste "
1132,Donatella Cinelli Colombini Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,2015,Sangiovese,Italy,159,14,0.0,0,"This red combines fresh cherry and strawberry fruit with graphite, earth and leather notes for a positive impression. A swath of burly tannins lingers on the finish, needing time to meld with the ripe fruit and rich texture. Best from 2024 through 2043. The Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva shows a dense and concentrated personality, owing much to the warm, sunny and delightful conditions of this epic growing season. This wine draws its fruit from a 10-hectare parcel with clay soils and wide-open skies with clouds and sunbeams, which take in most of the landscape to the north of Montalcino. This is a 9,600-bottle production. Black cherry, blackberry confit, spice and warm earth make up the bouquet. Plush and slightly sweet fruit flavors color the softly textured mouthfeel. This Riserva shows a bit of extra vintage ripeness, rendering a more accessible, medium-term drinking window. A red with plum, spice, chocolate and cherry, as well as orange peel. Full-bodied with firm, silky tannins and a juicy, flavorful finish. Really fine with a refined finish. Super balance and beauty here. Drink or hold. Menthol, crushed berry and violet aromas slowly develop along with whiffs of ground clove. The poised, medium-bodied palate is already accessible, offering juicy Marasca cherry and coffee bean alongside polished tannins. Drink 2022–2027. "
1133,E. Pira e Figli Barolo Mosconi,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,144,14.5,0.0,0,"Chiara Boschis has recently purchased more vineyards in the Mosconi cru located at a cool 370 meters in elevation in Monforte d'Alba. Sourcing its fruit from an organic 1.9-hectare parcel, the 2018 Barolo Mosconi is available in a slightly larger production of 9,000 bottles. This is terrific news for those who love the focus and precision that Chiara Boschis is known for. The Mosconi carries generous fruit weight and volume over a streamlined mouthfeel and tight tannins. The wine ends with fresh notes of blackberry, plum and wild rose. This red puts it all together—macerated cherry and plum fruit, a silky texture, vibrant structure and elegance—without sacrificing power or harmony. Complex and long, with a haunting finish that provides rose, menthol, licorice and iron accents. Best from 2025 This Mosconi from Chiara Boschis comes from a calcareous marl soil at almost 400 metres above sea level. The wine is quite a dense ruby colour in the glass, with restrained forest floor scents and whiffs of rosemary, chocolate and wild red fruits. Filigreed and complex, the palate has a delicate attack, firm tannins and good density, with flavours of tar and plenty of violet and pomegranate. Biting and still austere but softened by the French barriques - where the wine ages for two years - it's not ready to drink now yet will evolve nicely. Plenty of tense, wild-strawberry character to this with bright minerals, too. Medium-bodied with a punchy core of bright fruit, tight tannins and a tense, crystalline finish. From organically grown grapes. Needs time to even out. Best from 2024. "
1134,Taylor Fladgate Vintage Port,2018,Port,Portugal,120,20,0.0,0,"This is an exceptional vintage, most unusually the third declared in a row from this producer. Intensely perfumed and richly structured with dark black fruits and concentrated tannins, it is set for seriously long-term aging. The power of the wine, based around the producer's Quinta da Vargellas, is magnificent. Drink this major Port from 2029. Remarkably harmonious already, with a beautiful display of unadulterated blueberry, blackberry and plum sauce flavors that fan out, while anise, ganache and cassis accents fill in. So lush and seductive through the finish, it’s nearly drinkable. But just wait. Best from 2030 through 2050. 7,800 cases made. Aromatic and expressive, this adds a big bang for a finish that reminds you that it is, indeed, Taylor's. After opening it on the first day tasted, it tightened fast and showed the structure I like to see in serious Ports. It has that classic flavor profile as well and shows fine concentration. Even 48 hours later it had no problem showing off a little muscle, even though it drank decently at that point. The fruit is expressive, as noted, but it is still a bit closed just now. "
1135,Fess Parker Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,California,40,14.1,0.0,0,"Last of the Chardonnay, the 2018 Chardonnay Sanford & Benedict Vineyard offers lots of candied lemon and honeyed apple notes to go with medium to full-bodied richness, a rounded, layered texture, good concentration, and outstanding length. It develops more spice and brioche notes with time in the glass and is going to evolve for 4-6 years. Blair Fox, winemaker at Fess Parker, is never shy about his oak regime, but in recent years, his wines have become brighter and more expressive. This 2018 is a case in point: With its subtle minerality and limey freshness—lime pith and juice and limestone dust—it’s a tense and graceful chardonnay Prominent aromas of pear flesh meet with a squeeze of lemon on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. There is prominent acidity on the sip, where brisk lemon and grapefruit-peel flavors play against warmer tones of apple flesh. "
1136,Lagar de Cervera Albarino Rias Baixas,2020,Albarino,Spain,21,12.5,3.7,29,"A bright lemon colour with green hues in the glass, this Albariño showcases bright fruit plus refreshing acidity. The fruit is lean: citrus, green fruit, then moving into stone fruit. Salinity and brininess on the palate call for seared scallops or shrimp. Any freshly grilled seafood with a squeeze of lemon would accentuate the wine’s acidity and make for a pleasant pairing. "
1137,Pra Otto Soave Classico,2021,Garganega,Italy,19,0,4.1,16,"Quite refreshing and mineral with lots of green and white fruit. Stony nectarine and green-apple aromas.

1138,Prunotto Bussia Barolo,2016,Nebbiolo,Italy,95,14,0.0,0,"Bright with cherry, berry, mint, leather and tar aromas and flavors, this red possesses a matching structure for balance and poise. Well put together at this young stage, its harmony and length bodes well for the future. Best from 2022 through 2040. Really extracted aromas of ripe strawberries with some cedar and tea undertones, following through to a medium body with round, creamy tannins and a wonderful finish of ripe strawberries and citrus peel, as well as a hint of honey. Subtle and refined. Better after 2022. A touch of spice accents this wine’s cherry and strawberry flavors, those red fruit tones gaining flesh and verve as the wine takes on notes of mint and fresh tobacco. Juicy and mouthwatering, with a refined texture, this will only get better over the next several years. "
1139,Banfi Chianti Classico Riserva,2018,Sangiovese,Italy,19,14.5,3.8,15,"Deliciously savory, with notes of tar, dark chocolate, olives, currants and sun-dried tomatoes. Medium-bodied with fine, almost silky tannins, accompanied by bright acidity and salty minerality. Fresh finish. Drink now or hold COMMENTARY: The 2018 Banfi Chianti Classico Riserva is formidable without being over-the-top. Its palate presence is commendable. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of black fruit and exotic spices. Try it with a well-spiced, oven-roasted Porchetta. (Tasted: July 27, 2022, San Francisco, CA) This is hitting its stride, exuding floral aromas and flavors, along with succulent cherry and raspberry fruit.

1141,Rocca di Montegrossi San Marcellino Chianti Classico Gran Selezione,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,90,14.57,0.0,0,"Marco Ricasoli’s vineyards are located in the Monti area, in the southern sector of Gaiole. His 2019 from the 17-acre San Marcellino vineyard shows how much depth and concentration can be achieved from these rocky soils, even in a hot and drought-stricken vintage like 2017. Some of his neighbors had already finished harvesting by mid-September, but Ricasoli chose to wait and benefited from some late-season rains that helped to rebalance the vines. The wine offers deeply concentrated flavors of plum and black cherry, some of those dark fruit tones enhanced by a small percentage of pugnitello that’s blended with the sangiovese. Notes of fennel, lavender and red apple skin weave through the wine, the flavors underlined by a layer of graphite that gives a firm, mineral texture to this wine. The 2017 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Vigneto San Marcellino is potent, but also shockingly closed for this dry, warm year. Readers will have to be patient with the 2017 as it needs quite a bit of time to be at its best. Succulent dark cherry, plum, mocha, cloves and licorice all build into the huge, explosive finish. There's tremendous substance here, not to mention tons of sheer character. This opulent Chianti Classico is highlighted by blackberry, black currant and tar, with toasty oak accents. Starts out smooth, then the dense tannins emerge. Remains long and intense on the aftertaste, which is marked by the dark fruit and iron. Sangiovese and Pugnitello. Drink now through 2030. Expressive aromas of cherries, blueberries, chocolate, spices and smoked meat. The texture on the palate is creamy, with velvety tannins, showing energy and a lively violet edge towards the finish. Blackberries and green olives with orange-peel undertones. Full-bodied and very concentrated with chewy tannins. From organically grown grapes. It’s very extracted and needs time to soften. Try after 2024. "
1142,Robert Weil Kiedrich Grafenberg Riesling Spatlese,2020,Riesling,Germany,96,8.5,0.0,0,"Very complex, exotic floral and fruit aromas, which are all very delicate and fresh. Super focused and straight, the natural grape sweetness way in the background of the ripe yet sleek palate. At the finish, a cascade of pomegranate, exotic-fruit and herb character is married to intensely mineral acidity. Drink or hold. The 2020 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Riesling Spätlese offers a deep, complex and refined bouquet with flinty aromas. Highly refined and elegant on the palate, this is a salty-piquant, fresh, vital and energetic Gräfenberg with a long, piquant and salty finish. Very young but really fascinating in its brilliance, piquancy and salinity. "
1143,Azelia Barolo Margheria,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,110,14.5,0.0,0,"Smells like a bunch of fresh roses with strawberries and white mushrooms. It’s full-bodied with a very fine, layered palate with lightly dusty tannins. It’s extremely long and sophisticated. The 2017 Barolo Margheria is gorgeous. Open, perfumed aromatics are immediately alluring. On the palate, the 2017 is a dark, mysterious wine, with layers of flavor that continue to develop over time. Dark cherry, blood orange, spice, leather, iron and scorched earth add striking layers of nuance. The tannins are potent - we are in Serralunga after all - but the 2017 has so much to offer. It's a gorgeous Barolo to enjoy over the next two decades, maybe more. This opens with aromas of scorched earth that eventually give way to toasted hazelnut, forest floor, dried herbs and whiffs of iris. Full-bodied and elegant, the palate recalls cranberry, star anise and orange zest before an almost salty finish. Tightly knit, finegrained tannins provide support. Give it time to fully develop. The most structured and tannic of these new releases from Azelia is the 2017 Barolo Margheria. The tannins are quite present, meaning that you are required to afford generous aging time to this Barolo from Serralunga d'Alba, hoping that the fruit intensity will run the course. At this young stage, the wine shows blackberry and plum, with licorice, rusty nail and some crushed stone or terracotta clay. The wine's mineral signature is strong and elegant. In appearance, it reveals a lean and bright ruby color, and the power and natural richness of the mouthfeel come as a welcome surprise. The 2017 Barolo Margheria is herbaceous with sweet tobacco, dried black raspberry, and gentian root. The palate is drying with fast building tannins and notes of tea leaf, cherry pit, and orange pith. Tight and firmly tannic, this red's cherry, plum, eucalyptus, tar and mineral flavors are locked in for now. Though lightly astringent on the finish, this shows good balance overall. This just needs time. "
1144,Venturini Baldini Marchese Manodori,Lambrusco,Red Sparkling Wine,Italy,19,12,3.6,52,"A full eight months before Thanksgiving rolls back around, we already know at least one wine we’ll be serving for the big feast. This blend of four Lambrusco grapes—Marani, Maestri, Salamino, and Grasparossa—exudes holiday spirit with aromas of cranberry, red plum, and touches of herb and balsamic, the latter of which reappears on the rather savory, well-structured palate along with bright cherry and pepper Fascinating aromas of cherries and flowers with hints of spices. Medium body, light bubbles and a fresh and delicious finish. From organically grown grapes. "
1145,Charles Ellner Carte Blanche,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,42,12,4.1,127,"Vivid lemon peel acidity is a fine foil for the rich hints of marzipan, baked pear and almond skin in this well-balanced and creamy Champagne. Smoke and saline notes linger on the lightly mouthwatering finish. Drink now through 2020. "
1146,Saints Hills Posh,2019,Other White Wine,Croatia,24,13,4.6,7,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Saint Hills Posh is appealing and rewarding. TASTING NOTES: This wine dances on the palate with flavors of savory spices, mineral notes, and racy, dried citrus. Enjoy it with a pan-fried snapper. (Tasted: March 21, 2022, San Francisco, CA) This Croatian white is made from the indigenous Posip grape. It is pale straw in color with aromas of lemon zest, river rock, mandarin orange and lemon grass with just a whiff of dried Mediterranean herbs. It is soft on entry but very full-bodied in the mouth with flavors of vanilla, lemon curd and grapefruit. It is well balanced with nice minerality and a touch of salinity on the finish. "
1147,Centorri Moscato,2021,Muscat,Italy,12,6.5,4.7,16,"COMMENTARY: The 2021 Centorri Moscato di Pavia is well-made, fun, and delightful on the palate.

1148,Canalicchio di Sopra Brunello di Montalcino (375ML half-bottle),2017,Sangiovese,Italy,64,14.5,0.0,0,"Aromas of underbrush, blue flowers and ripe black-skinned fruit mingle with new leather. The concentrated, full-bodied palate doles out ripe plum, fleshy black cherry, star anise and tobacco set against velvety, enveloping tannins. A great performance for the scorching vintage, you won't have to wait long before enjoying this, but it will also offer years of fine drinking. Drink 2023–2029. As you drive downhill from the hamlet of Montalcino on its north side, you pass the Canalicchio di Sopra winery, which is located in a shallow, sun-lit basin of vines. This estate is meticulous and studied in its winemaking philosophy, and the 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is an expression of that concentration. This warm-climate Brunello reveals awesome purity and intensity with wild cherry, almond and lilac spread over a tonic, mid-weight finish. This wine awards plenty of elegance in a vintage that was not easy and not prone to such nuance. This shows beautiful balance and drinkability, with firm and slightly chewy tannins, yet the fruit is pure and flavorful. Some bark and crushed-stone undertones. Very drinkable now, but better in 2023. This red bursts with sweet, ripe cherry and plum fruit, with tobacco, leather and mineral elements adding depth as it builds to a lingering conclusion. Shows fine balance, a vibrant structure and excellent length. Spicy aftertaste. Best from 2024  "

This is sweet, agile and bright with a succulent, tangy citrus character. A nimble, zestier expression of Sauternes. From organically grown grapes. Drink or hold. Distinctive, with the forward apricot, peach and quince profile of the vintage but with extra acacia, honeysuckle and heather notes, which add lift and length through the nicely defined finish. Although unctuous, this has some drive to carry it along nicely. Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc. Best from 2023. "
1151,Poliziano Rosso di Montepulciano,2020,Sangiovese,Italy,17,13.5,3.9,8,"A rich, smooth style, delivering cherry, plum, iron and tobacco aromas and flavors. Balanced, with a solid line of tannins providing support. Sangiovese and Merlot. Drink now  "
1152,Chateau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,219,13.5,4.5,13,"This shows spices, pepper, blueberries and blackcurrants on the nose. Full body, very polished tannins and a long and beautiful finish. Shows such gorgeous texture. Precise and transparent. Try in 2022. Beautifully extracted, this is rich, ripe and layered. It is utterly gorgeous and has real precision and tension. It delivers its Pauillac swagger with the most gentle of hands - the tannins are fine, layered-up and building their defences without imposing too heavily on the succulent black fruits. It judges the vintage extremely well and is the best in this line-up for me. 1% Petit Verdot completes the blend. 60% new oak. I tasted the 2015 Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande on three separate occasions rating it 97 twice and 98 once. Checking in as a final blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this is a nuanced style of wine that grows on you with time in the glass, and the larger Merlot component always gives it a more supple, seductive texture. Crème de cassis, black raspberries, spring flowers, leafy herbs and lead pencil notes all flow to a full-bodied, ultra-pure, seamless beauty that builds on the palate, has fine tannin and a great, great finish. As classy as they come, it will continue to impress for two to three decades. A blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot aged for 18 months in barrels, 60% new, the 2015 Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande displays a medium to deep garnet-purple color and is elegantly fruited with crushed red currants, black raspberries and cassis with touches of lavender, rose hips, tilled soil, fungi and charcuterie. Medium-bodied, finely crafted, remarkably pure and beautifully poised, it has a firm frame of very fine-grained tannins and oodles of freshness, finishing on a lingering mineral note. A fresh and focused style, with a terrific beam of black cherry and black currant compote flavors. Strong graphite and black tea notes harness the finish, ending with alder and tobacco echoes. This has serious length without losing any drive along the way. Best from 2022 through 2038. "
1153,DeLille Chaleur Blanc,2021,Bordeaux White Blends,Washington,42,13.9,4.2,5,"67% Sauvignon Blanc; 33% Semillon. This blend makes full use of both varieties by combining a fruity, slightly grassy beginning with melon and mineral layers in both nose and mouth. There is more than enough depth here, and while a tad on the supple side at entry, it firms up very nicely across the palate and into its long and tasty finish. Its balance and stuffing suggest that the wine will age well for several years. "
1154,Vietti Barolo Ravera,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,250,14,0.0,0,"Vietti is one of a handful of estates to bring the Ravera MGA of Novello to the current popularity it enjoys now. Their 2018 Barolo Ravera has a smoky personality with crushed stone and pencil shavings. There is plenty of dark fruit at the back, ripe cherry and blackberry mostly, and the wine is tonic and firm in terms of its structure and tannins. The Ravera is a wine of enormous length and a finely tuned texture. Best After 2025 Lighter structure this year, but it’s intense, with focused red-cherry and raspberry character and spicy and mineral nuances. Medium-bodied with firm tannins and a very tight finish. This is super-compact and needs time to expand.  This red leads off with a distinctive minty note allied with cherry, iron, tobacco and underbrush flavors. Turns firm and linear on the finish, with a sinewy feel, yet remains fresh and long. Very pure.  "

From the Achleiten at 460 meters above sea level, the 2020 Riesling Smaragd Wachstum Bodenstein opens with an intense, ripe and fleshy yet coolish, refined and elegant bouquet of white peaches and perfectly ripe apricots.

As I approached this blue bubbly, I was skeptical and not wanting to like it. When I tasted it, while it is not as dry as most ""bruts,"" it was quite delicious and pleasurable. The Blanc de Bleu® Cuvée Mousseux is an attractive and well-made sparkling wine. I am now hoping to revert from my "" wine geekiness."" and to rejoin the rest of the real world. TASTING NOTES: This wine is fluorescent and translucent blue in its appearance— flamboyant to say the least, and asking me to put away my notebook, and enjoy. In the aroma and on the palate, this effervescent beverage shows apples and berries. Its medium sweet finish makes it a crowd-pleasing choice for social gatherings and light hors-d'oeuvres.

1163,Chateau Berliquet,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,53,14.5,0.0,0,"Blackberry, plum, blueberry and some stone and crushed cement on the nose. Full body with firm, chewy and ultra fine tannins that will soften nicely. I like the lightly smoked nuts and chocolate. Needs time to come around. Try after 2025. Powerful and plush as it opens after an initial moment of full-on austerity. This needs a good 30 minutes in the glass to really open, and I suggest giving it a full eight to 10 years in bottle before it reaches the right moment to start drinking. This was the first full year for the Canon team, and the work will take another few years to fully show results, but this has clear blueberry and raspberry fruits, structured tannins and a density that comes from the clay that is shot through the limestone in the vineyard. Harvested around two weeks earlier than under the previous owner. The 2018 Berliquet is composed of 78% Merlot and 22% Cabernet Franc and has 14.5% alcohol. Deep garnet-purple in color, it slowly unfurls in the glass to reveal a classic nose of ripe black plums, wild blueberries and pencil shavings with hints of unsmoked cigars, tilled soil and red roses. The medium to full-bodied palate is chock-full of blue and black fruit preserves, supported by plush tannins and impressive freshness, finishing long and mineral laced. Since the Chanel takeover and under Nicolas Audebert’s direction, the development of this site and the wine are truly impressive. I suspect a lot of selection has gone into making this 2018, and the results reveal a top-tier Saint-Émilion in the making. Under the same winemaking team as Château Canon, this wine shows richness, with swathes of ripe black-fruited Merlot and a licorice character. Bold, ripe flavors are warm and opulent, mitigated by fresher black-currant acidity at the end. Drink from 2026. This is delightful, with a fine chalky thread running through the middle of gently crushed plum and black cherry fruit flavors while sweet tobacco and bay accents hang in the background. Sneaky long. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. "

It has plenty of staunch tannins, but they’re as finely woven as a silk tapestry, while the flavors are dazzling, suggesting black cherries, red currants and hints of dark chocolate and anise. Kudos to winemaker Aaron Pott for this remarkable blend from all around the valley. Subtle black cherry, black licorice and floral scents extend onto the palate. Elegant, graceful, deftly balanced young wine that retains focus and persistence. Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. "
1166,Mercat Cava Brut,Nature,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Spain,16,11.5,3.7,97,"From vines planted on clay and limestone around the village of Sant Sadurni d’Anoia, this is a classic blend of 50 percent xarel.lo, 40 percent macabeo, with parellada making up the rest. It aged for 18 months on its lees and developed slight hints of flor, as if it were a bubbly interpretation of a Fino. It moves through the mouth in cool waves of flavor, the texture firm yet creamy. It’s a rich, layered sparkler to serve with suquet de peix, a classic Catalàn fish soup with clams. A wonderful peachy bouquet that blossoms in the glass with hints of dried apricot and honeysuckle. The palate is very well-balanced with crisp acidity and a fine thread of bitter lemon that lends tension and poise, leading to a very champagnois finish. Excellent! "

A whirl of mixed raspberries and blackberries join with salted licorice and dark chocolate, culminating in a long finish that combines more-ish salinity with the dusty essence of crushed stone.

1217,Jaume Serra Cristalino Cava Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,Spain,10,11,3.5,235,"This blend of 80% Trepat and 20% Pinot Noir has a deep cranberry hue.

Deep ruby-purple, it explodes with cassis, violets and aniseed, with wafts of thyme, tobacco and iron, offering new nuances with each return to the glass. The full-bodied palate is powerful and refined, with loads of rounded tannins, focused freshness and ethereal character. It's exceptionally expressive and structured and should be very long lived in the cellar. Blueberries, blackberries and crushed stones. Pure fruit. Full-bodied with round tannins that have powdery character. Creamy and round mouth-feel. Very unique. Great finish. 90% merlot, 5% cabernet franc and 5% malbec. Best from 2026. The 2019 La Muse offers a luxurious and layered perfume of red apple, sweet tobacco, and fresh leather. The palate is generous, with velveteen texture, noes of cassis, violets, and fresh earth, and a weightless feel. The most open of the three presented by Verite, this is an incredible wine and will be fantastic to check in on over the next two or more decades. Smooth and well defined, this Merlot-dominant wine has a nice delicacy to it. Lifted and bright, there is a sense of joy to this with excellent detail and definition to the fruit and the fine tannins. Clearly powerful with concentration but well delivered. I like the liquorice and the subtle herbal spiced edges - rosemary and cinnamon giving nuance as well as the slightly sweet but supple red and black cherry and blueberries fruit which mingle with scented dried flower notes. A refined style with a lifted finish that is really enjoyable. Ageing 16 months in French oak (95% new). "

A tasting of several foudres point to a wine with natural, easy balance. The Mourvèdre is excellent here this year, and adds great depth to the fresh and delightful Grenache that has notes of black tea, black cherry and iron. Elegant and very fine. Proprietor Paul-Vincent Avril expects to bottle 100,000 bottles of something approximating this ""final blend,"" tasted out of foudre. A blend of 55% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre and 10% Syrah and other permitted varieties, the 2020 Chateauneuf du Pape looked exceptional on this day, offering up scents of framboise and kirsch alongside dried flowers and Asian spices.

Offers breadth and depth with a seamless feel, capped by a subtle mineral edge that lingers lengthily amid the beautiful fruit. Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre.  Looking at the reds, the 2020 Châteauneuf Du Pape is a silky, elegant wine that shows the vintage to a T. I was able to taste through all the foudres of the cuvée as well as one that’s a final blend, with all showing beautiful red and black fruits, peppery garrigue, and floral nuances. The purity of fruit is remarkable, and this will be a medium to full-bodied, finesse-driven, yet still concentrated vintage for this cuvée that readers will love.

Peciña Crianza is the best Crianza they have ever produced, which is often the case with the current vintage for sale... But I must admit that the wine was very impressively balanced, nuanced and complex. It has freshness and is approachable enough while showing Rioja character and integrated oak to appeal to a wide audience. It's ripe without excess, coming through as juicy and tasty. It spent two years in used American oak barrels.  "

Vibrant purple raspberries mark the nose and palate, lingering elegantly on the finish and picking up hints of wild thyme and bay leaf. I'd rather drink this than some underachieving producer's Châteauneuf, and it should be uncommonly long-lived for a Côtes du Rhône. Best after 2023 Loads of kirsch liqueur, ground pepper, garrigue, and some obvious earthy minerality emerge from the 2019 Côtes du Rhône Les Garrigues, a wine that pushes on the ripeness level while staying balanced, seamless, and weightless. This opulent, hedonistic Grenache is going to keep for 8-10 years. Very dense black-plum bouquet with touches of bitter chocolate, raisin and licorice. For 15.5% alcohol this remains surprisingly cool and restrained on the palate, also thanks to the solid tannin base that gives it a certain grip. Even the finish is quite dry right to the end.

1228,Petit & Bajan Blanc de Noirs Brut Obsidienne Grand,Cru,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,79,0,0.0,0,"The NV Grand Cru Blanc de Noirs Brut Obsidienne is 100% Pinot Noir and spent three years on lees. It has lots of musky white fruits, toasted bread, spice, and earthy mineral notes to go with a richer, rounded, textured style on the palate that still carries bright acidity. It should keep for a solid decade. The platinum-gold color barely hints at the fact that the wine is 100 percent pinot noir, grown in the chalk and clay soils of Verzenay. The floral notes of roses might, along with the the youthful power. The fruit shows off a range of earthiness, bringing to mind the skin of a fresh-dug potato, and the fuzz of an underripe peach. It’s as if the Champagne limestone had come to life in a wine that’s formidable and refreshing. COMMENTARY: The Champagne Petit & Bajan Obsidienne shine with freshness and brightness. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of tart apples and loads of minerality. Try it with a bowl of steamed clams. (Tasted: September 12, 2022, San Francisco, CA) A riper nose features notes of pear and apple compote, Meyer lemon and equally discreet yeast character.

On the palate, it's full-bodied, broad and vinous, with ripe but racy acids, good depth at the core and a delicate mousse. Concentrated and structured, another year on the cork will be rewarded by additional complexity, even though this is approachable now. A creamy blanc de noirs, with a minerally underpinning of chalk and smoke accents, this balanced version layers lively acidity and flavors of crushed blackberry, almond biscotti, mandarin orange peel and a hint of white balsamico on a fine mousse.

Tobacco, tar, dark chocolate, floral touches, bitter blood orange, scrubland herbs - so much going on the nose, really aromatic and expressive in a dark, sticky way. Gorgeously lifted and lively, full of bright and crunchy red fruits that you're just not expecting after the nose, this is direct but it has a pristine quality to it. Tannis are fine and the whole taste is just so clean. Juicy, mouthwatering and joyful, really bright and playful, I love the whole lifted tone, almost verging on tangy and sour but just keeps the depth. You get a bit of saltiness too on the finish. I like this a lot, especially the touch of metallic, iron-filing, blood on the finish. Characterful. The first vintage to use an optical sorted at harvest. Ageing 14 months in French oak (65% new and 35% in one year old). Starting off with the 2020 Optimus, it's a blend of 58% Syrah, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 11% Petit Verdot that spent 14 months in 65% new French oak. It displays a solid deeper purple hue to go with a peppery, darker berry, graphite, and smoky earth-driven bouquet. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has a round, supple, mouth-filling texture, quality tannins, plenty of mid-palate depth, and outstanding length. It's clearly an outstanding wine but a step back from past vintages. "

Its dense purple color is just beginning to reveal some garnet. The nose exhibits abundant floral notes intermixed with notions of blueberries, black raspberries and licorice-infused cassis. Graceful, elegant, and close to full maturity, it is drinking beautifully, displaying secondary nuances, a supple, full-bodied texture and a lush, layered mouthfeel. There is not a bit of aggressiveness, and the tannins, wood and alcohol (14.5%) are all beautifully integrated. As one might expect, this is one of the vintage’s superstars. "
1232,Tolpuddle Vineyard Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,Australia,84,0,0.0,0,"I was shocked at the intensity of the 2021 Chardonnay when I first tasted it. How could a wine so young have this much flavor? It is polished, glassy and graceful. It unfurls in the mouth and soars long over the horizon. It's balanced and powerful, crouching at this early stage, but all the building blocks of greatness are here. A wine of extension, expansion and elegance—a formidable trio. Best After 2022 "

A little less round in mouthfeel from some in the area (not appellation - this is Bordeaux Blanc), but still with slate texture and minerality showing how well the soils here can work for dry white, and an excellent juicy delivery of citrus and white pear. A fresh style, with just a whiff of brioche leading the way for honeysuckle, white peach and verbena notes. Ends with a nice mouthwatering edge on the finish. Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc. Drink now. Lime and green mango with intense lemon and mineral character and crushed-stone undertones. It’s medium-bodied with a tight, creamy texture. Some sliced apple, pear and lemon grass.

Let the wine age and drink from 2022. Just 1,200 bottles of this prestige cuvée were made in 2009, a blend of 57% Pinot Noir from vineyards in Ay, Verzenay, Ambonnay and Bouzy. The 43% Chardonnay comes from Avize, Mesnil sur Oger, Chouilly and Villers-Marmery. Its gorgeous colour comes from the inclusion of 6% Pinot Noir still wine, produced by Deutz from plots of old vines on the Ay hillside known as ‘La Belle’, as well as from plots in Mareuil-sur-Ay called ‘Cumaine’ and ‘Charmont’.

On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, fine-boned and elegant, with racy acids, a pretty core of fruit, a delicate mousse and a deceptively long finish. Understated but displaying terrific finesse, this wine exemplifies the Deutz style. Creamy and elegant, with a lovely, mouthwatering juiciness to the well-knit acidity and a fine, chalk-tinged underpinning to the delicate flavors of nectarine, white cherry, spring blossom and candied pink grapefruit zest.

1242,Von Strasser Reserve Red Wine,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,135,14.2,3.9,5,"Rudy von Strasser’s Reserve is an unusual blend of equal parts cabernet sauvignon and petit verdot, with 20 percent malbec and merlot. Petit verdot requires the right conditions to ripen and is usually used only in small amounts as a blending grape for its color and tannins. Here, those muscular tannins are in full force, wrestling the rich cherry and black licorice flavors to the ground so you’re left breathing earth.

Supremely elegant with delicate perfume surrounding the rich fruit aromas with a dusting of vanilla and milk chocolate. Excellent tension on the palate - you feel this is so direct and pristine, the flavours just driving from start to finish in one straight push but with concentration and intensity. It's not so layered or expansive at this point but so well executed - you can feel the power. Tannins are grippy with ripe blackcurrants, a fleshy kind of texture to the palate with a hint of dry stoniness and salinity on the finish alongside liquorice and clove. So young and too young to drink but this has incredible depth, confidence and restraint. It's sleeping now. This is a beautiful expression of coastal Tuscany and the sunny Mediterranean. The Ornellaia 2019 Bolgheri Superiore Ornellaia (a blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot) pours from the bottle with a specific darkness that has elements of both inky saturation and ruby highlights. The wine is saturated and rich—this is something you notice off the bat—but it also reveals a pleasing lightness or grace that is transmitted to both the bouquet and the palate. Dark fruit, pressed blackberry and plum mingle with more substantial aromas of spice, leather and sweetly cured tobacco. The tannins are beautifully managed, and the wine sports considerable heft and density on the palate that drives a very long and pleasurable mouthfeel. The aromas of blackcurrants, fresh basil and thyme, as well as cedar and sandalwood are so attractive. It’s full-bodied and very linear with tight tannins that draw you down the length of this young wine. Wet-earth and cool-stone undertones. It’s solid and so structured.

Available in numbered bottles, the organic Cavallotto 2017 Barolo Bricco Boschis is a generous and fleshed out expression that opens to immediate aromas of cherry, wild plum and cassis. There are floral notes as well, and some spice, licorice and grilled herb. Like many of the Barolos I tasted from this vintage, the bouquet is accessible and generous now, but the wine is tannic and more austere in terms of mouthfeel, requiring extra bottle age. The hope is that both the bouquet and the palate will evolve at the same pace. From 45-year-old vines. Dense, meaty tannins encase fl avors of dark cherry and cassis in this high-octane wine. Notes of black tea and licorice accent the dark fruit, and the fi nish is brightened by a burst of orange peel. This tightly knit and extracted wine demands patience.

This limpid, unoaked wine is made from the Mencia grape variety (known as Jaen in Portugal) plus a little Garnacha and Souson, and the emphasis is on its sloe, bramble and damson fruits in all their primary glory, almost as if it had been run from the vats just a week or two earlier. The palate is soft-textured, mouth-filling, exuberant and comely, structured more prominently by acidity than tannin, though that acidity is sweet and juicy in its own right. There is nothing at all sharp or hard about this tender, almost lip-smacking red … yet the variety itself, and the legacy of its austere, granite-soiled origins, somehow contrive to stop the wine tasting simple. This is a fresh and bright, raw-grape beauty. It’s all primary pleasure, pungent, in-your-face blackberry fruit, simple and friendly. “The blood of the earth, in a good way,” one panelist said.

These all flow to a straight-up gorgeous, opulent Pinot Noir with a silky mouthfeel, polished tannins, and a great, great finish. This is pure Russian River goodness, and while I don't think it's going to make old bones, it will evolve nicely for a solid 4-6 years. Silky and smooth, with lovely notes of ripe cherry and good balance; elegant and long Pretty aromas of wild strawberries, bark, licorice, fresh herbs and lemon zest.

The warm 2020 vintage has produced a wine that is generous, poised between crisp citrus and hints of yellow fruits. The subtle use of wood aging will sustain this wine for its long-term future. "
1253,Kendall-Jackson Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,32,14.5,3.7,23,"The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Grand Reserve is blended with 7% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc, 3% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot and was matured for 15 months in 30% new French oak. It has a deep ruby-purple color and pretty accents of cinnamon, violet, leather, dried herbs and bitter chocolate complementing cassis fruit. The full-bodied palate is concentrated yet fresh, with finely grained tannins, pure flavors and a very long finish. This grows at high-eleva-tion estate vineyards, predominantly from the mountains above Alexander Valley (91 percent) with a contribution from Knights Valley. That tight, mountain-grown struc-ture is apparent in the iron-filing austerity of the tannins and the restraint they place on the wine’s dark floral fruit. You could play off the capsicum spice in those youthful tan-nins and decant this for a slow-braised pork shoulder. Or you could cellar it for five years or more. Classic aromas of cedar and spice emerge from the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Grand Reserve, followed by notes of black cherry fruit and graphite. The palate is full-bodied and fruit-forward, with blackcurrant, fresh soil, and cocoa powder. Ripe tannins emerging from the fruit, and the wine has a fairly long finish.  "
1254,Domaine Labruyere Moulin-a-Vent Le Clos Monopole,2019,Gamay,France,95,14.5,0.0,0,"A deep, savory and wet-earth nose pulls you into this rich and fleshy Moulin-a-Vent that has pronounced soy-sauce and balsamic notes. The supple tannins and moderate acidity make this easy to enjoy right away. But at the finish there are plenty of fine-grained tannins and this should age well in the medium-term. Sustainable. Drink or hold. "

Deliciously fresh and lifted. COMMENTARY: The Pierre Sparr Crémant d'Alsace is an excellent sparkling wine at a value price. TASTING NOTES: This wine is fresh, bright, and appealing. Its crisp aromas and flavors of tart citrus and ginger should pair nicely as an aperitif with hors d'oeuvres. (Tasted: August 14, 2019, San Francisco, CA) A floral note of summer blossom accompanies fresh notes of green and yellow apple on this wine’s nose.

1261,Pietroso Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,79,14.5,0.0,0,"Aromas of eucalyptus, black-skinned berries, underbrush and leather emerge from the glass. The savory, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, star anise and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. It's already approachable but also shows good midterm aging potential. Pietroso is comprised of three small vineyards in distinct areas of Montalcino: one surrounds the estate just southwest of the town; another is in the northern zone of Canalicchio; and the last is close to Castelnuovo dell’Abate. The 2017 is rather discreet and unassuming, lightly perfumed with mossy green undergrowth and a mineral undertow. Mid-weight and suede-like in texture, the palate flows gracefully, delivering tangy cherries and chalky tannins. A palate-cleansing wine, this begs for duck pappardelle. The Pietroso 2017 Brunello di Montalcino shows a sweet side with cherry, easy fruit and spice. This vintage is simple in execution and delivery with a rather short finish and plenty of rich fruit weight. I recommend a near-term drinking window for this bottle. Scents of violet and rose petal lead into flavors of baked cherry and strawberry in this appealing young Brunello. The dark, mineral tannins are smooth and polished, the fruit tones layered with notes of dried herbs and a bright twist of orange peel. "

It is ripe and balanced, with yellow flowers, honeycomb, and plum, and it has elegant concentration and underlying tension, precise mousse, and rich salinity, with lingering notes of croissant and delicate smoke. This will be an exciting wine in the range to follow. Best after 2022. "

Revealing a deep, opaque purple color as well as classic Cabernet notes of ripe black and blue fruits, smoked tobacco, scorched earth, and graphite, this beauty hits the palate with medium to full-bodied richness, a stacked mid-palate, building yet ripe tannins, and a great finish.

The 2019 Crozes-Hermitage is a spicy, complex, incredibly satisfying Crozes with textbook darker berry fruits as well as notes of peppery herbs, violets, and loamy earth.

1274,Chateau Palmer,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,296,0,0.0,0,"So much sweet tobacco, stone, brambleberry and currant on the nose. The palate is full and compact with very polished tannins, yet they are solid and sturdy and run the length and width of the wine. Energetic acidity. Very structured and powerful, yet agile and impressive. Historic feel. From biodynamically grown grapes. This needs at least six years of bottle age to soften. Try after 2027. The 2019 Château Palmer is even richer, with a stacked, full-bodied, concentrated profile as well as beautiful notes of ripe black cherries, blackcurrants, lead pencil, tobacco leaf, and chocolate. I love its mid-palate, it has building, ripe, yet substantial tannins, tons of fat and glycerin, and a gorgeous finish. I don't think it will ultimately match the 2009, 2016, or 2018, but it's nevertheless a brilliant wine as well as one of the stars of the show from Margaux. It will benefit from 7-8 years of bottle age (it already offers pleasure) and have 30-40 years of overall longevity. Best After 2022 Shows the powerful fruit of the vintage, with waves of dark plum, warmed cassis and cherry compote flavors driving through, inlaid with a graphite edge and backed by an iron note on the finish.

The complexity of the wine is impressive: a mix of exotic Asian spice and forested earth that contrast and complement around firm seamless tannin. The 2016 Pinot Noir Rice-Spivak Vineyard is medium ruby-purple in the glass and slowly opens on the nose to stewed Earl Grey tea leaves, saline, rosewater perfume and a broody core of ripe red and black cherries, cranberry and perfumed earth. The medium-bodied palate is concentrated and spicy with soft, grainy tannins and tangy acidity, finishing long and bright. Fresh and crunchy, with sinewy power to the dried cherry and berry flavors, featuring saline hints. Red currant, mineral and savory aspects emerge on the pure-tasting and taut finish. "
1277,Ronan by Clinet,2016,Merlot,France,12,13.5,3.6,39,"Expressive nose full of ripe red fruits and floral scents. The smooth, sappy red berry fruit is smooth and detailed, succulent, with tannins that are massy and chewy though also have a slightly chalky edge giving more texture and flavor detail. A 100% Merlot made by the same team as Chateau Clinet in Pomerol with a collection of growers across Bordeaux. Perfect for drinking, though with life in it yet. The Merlot-dominated 2016 By Clinet (there's 5% Cabernet Franc) is a charming, already delicious effort that gives up elegant notes of chocolate-laced plums and dark fruits, notes of leafy herbs and truffle, medium to full body, and a layered, charming mouthfeel.

It already opens beautifully on the palate. Drink after 2025. A beautiful Canon that performs the 360-degree trick in your mouth of expanding up, down and out. Of course a little austere right now at this young age, but already walking the tightrope towards richness; the creaminess in the texture becomes clear after 20 minutes in the glass.

Gorgeous on the palate as well, with medium to full-bodied richness, ultra-fine tannins, flawless balance, and again, this wonderful sense of freshness paired with ample richness, it needs 4-5 years of bottle age and will evolve for 30+ years. The 2009 and 2015 are still my favorite vintages of this wine, but this is up there with the best of them. Ripe and focused, with a core of plum, black cherry and raspberry compote notes that are still a bit coiled up, though inlaid with a racy chalky spine and notes of black tea and tobacco that should all meld as it stretches out in the cellar. A restrained, refined, lengthy wine that drips with class. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2024 through 2038. "

Scents of cassis, pencil shavings, loam and mocha all appear on the nose, while the full-bodied palate is expansive and velvety without getting jammy or overly broad. Perhaps most important, for a wine that will presumably be consumed along savory dishes, it's nicely savory itself, with earthy notes and gentle tannins punctuating the long finish.

One taster compared the smokiness of this wine to a peaty Highland Scotch, even if that aspect is a highlight. It’s the ripe red fruit that drives the wine, cushioned by oak tannins, its delicate strawberry notes lasting with finesse. The flavors would meld with the sweetness of broiled unagi. This silky, polished champagne is produced from certified organic grapes grown in the premier cru village Chamery (Petite Montagne), fermented in cask and aged ten months on the lees before bottling. The wine was disgorged in June 2019 and finished with no dosage. The result is arrestingly pure and elegant, with aromas that range from lime peel to ripe apple and toast, a discreet, well-integrated autolysis, and an impressively lingering finish. "
1302,Laurent Fayolle Les Diognieres Hermitage Rouge,2019,Syrah/Shiraz,France,109,0,0.0,0,"Coming from a site on the eastern side of the hill, the 2019 Hermitage Les Diognieres reveals a dense purple color as well as a beautiful array of cassis and darker berry fruits along with notes of pepper, loamy earth, and cedary spice. Just gorgeous on the palate and all about finesse and elegance, it has silky tannins, full body, no hard edges, and remarkable balance. I love it today, yet it has a solid 20+ years of longevity ahead of it. A fresh, lifted, intense nose with star anise, incense, and clove among the black fruits. Very powerful but not massively full-bodied, the alcohol however is high. Though fine, the tannins just a little hard, and there's a touch of slightly drying oak tannin. Finishes long and will be good in time. The oak influence is pronounced but it works with the wine. From a 0.28ha plot in lieu-dit Les Dionnières at the foot of the hill. 60-year-old vines, all destemmed. Vinified in open demi-muids, manual punching down two or three times a day. Followed by malolactic fermentation and 14 months ageing in barriques. Cedar and cracked pepper notes mark the nose of the fully destemmed 2019 Hermitage les Dionnieres, backed by ripe blueberries and black cherries. Smooth, ripe and creamy in feel, this full-bodied yet supple Hermitage looks to be a top-flight effort. With the concentration and balance evidenced on the long, silky finish, it's delicious now and should still be going strong well into the next decade. Inviting, with warm plum compote and cherry pâte de fruit notes laced with melted red licorice, red tea, fruitcake and floral accents. The nice polished feel through the finish adds to the flattering style. Best from 2023 "
1303,Artadi La Poza de Ballesteros,2019,Tempranillo,Spain,139,14.66,0.0,0,"Here comes another tight and powerful plot wine from Artadi with a bit of dark chocolate and warm stones to the wild herbs, slightly baked plums, mulberries and blackberries. Intense and so dense with tight, quite tough tannins. There is real potential here. Tempranillo. From organically grown grapes. Drink from 2026. The 2019 La Poza de Ballesteros is a powerful and ripe wine with 14.66% alcohol and ripe fruit, volume and round and dense tannins. The exposition to the afternoon sun and the deeper soils of this 1.18-hectare plot of vines planted in 1960 on deep brown soils give the grapes more ripeness, and this wine is always a riper expression of Tempranillo. It has notes of black fruit and tobacco, and it's round and generous, more voluptuous, with round tannins and instant gratification. It's expressive and direct, quite gentle.Best After 2022 "
1304,Domaine Thibault Liger-Belair Nuits-Saint-Georges La Charmotte,2019,Pinot Noir,France,109,13,0.0,0,"This 0.4ha, domaine-owned parcel of vines on the northern edge of Nuits is located right below the premiers crus and was planted in 1962. Nearly half of the grapes were fermented as whole bunches and gently pumped over, before ageing in cask with a high proportion of new barrels. The result, however, is silky and fresh, with raspberry fruit and a floral edge. Elegant and very fine. "
1305,Casanuova delle Cerbaie Brunello di Montalcino Riserva,2012,Sangiovese,Italy,99,15,0.0,0,"Baked plum, star anise, aromatic herb, new leather and pressed violet scents create an enticing bouquet. The powerfully structured savory palate offers dried black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and tobacco framed in firm fine-grained tannins. You'll also note the warmth of alcohol on the close, but the fruit richness keeps it in check. Drink after 2022. This is a robust and unflinching red wine with a succulent core of ripe cherry fruit. The 2012 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Vigna Montosoli is more restrained and elegant compared to many of its peers from this hot vintage. Those scorching summer temperatures have been expertly absorbed, and the wine never feels jammy or heavy. The mid-weight finish is fine and graceful. A big very ripe nose with plums and raisins. This is a rich and powerful wine, but with moderate tannins for a Brunello. This makes it quite easy to drink now. The finish has a lot of earthy depth. Probably has two decades ahead of it. Drink or hold. "
1306,Quinta do Vesuvio Vintage Port,2019,Port,Portugal,89,20,0.0,0,"This is really vivid, with a beautiful range of cassis, cherry purée, boysenberry coulis and plum reduction notes unfurling across the palate while succulent licorice, warm fruitcake and enticing red and black tea. "
1307,Domaine Jean-Jacques Confuron Nuits-St-Georges Les Chaboeufs Premier Cru,2018,Pinot Noir,France,129,0,0.0,0,Reduction dominates the nose at present. Otherwise there is both good underlying tension and definition to the muscular middle weight plus flavors that flash evident power on the moderately firm and rustic finale. This is very Nuits in character and should age accordingly. 
1308,Chateau de Fosse-Seche Laurasie Rouge,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,France,79,12.5,0.0,0,"Darker in its ruby color, the 2019 Laurasie is a pure Cabernet Sauvignon from almost 20-year-old vines on the stony Jurassic plateau of Fosse-Sèche, where yields are not bigger than 20 hectoliters per hectare. This is fleshy and concentrated yet pure, fresh and elegant on the deep, terroir-driven and beautifully floral (violets) as well as graphitic nose that is absolutely distinctive in its delicate, pure and balanced style. Black and blue berries, dark cherries, green paprika, pencil lead and herbal, wet gravelly notes lead to a medium to full-bodied, highly elegant, refined and perfectly balanced palate that exhibits perfectly ripe, round and juicy fruit with a firm but ripe, very fine and elegant tannin/acidity complex. The finish of this concentrated red is tight, intense and spicy, showing black berry and chocolate as well as graphite and coal with dark cherry notes. Irresistible and, in 2019, possibly the finest wine from Fosse-Sèche. The wine was aged for 12 months in concrete eggs. Tasted in January 2021. "

1313,John Duval Plexus Red,2019,Rhone Red Blends,Australia,42,14.5,0.0,0,"Whether it's the extra year in bottle or the different conditions experienced in 2019 compared to 2020, this 2019 Plexus is slightly more savory, more seamless and softer. This really has it all... the dark chocolate, black cherry, raspberry pip, tobacco char and hung deli meat in each and every mouthful. Very nicely done.

1315,Duemani CiFRA Cabernet Franc,2020,Cabernet Franc,Italy,49,13.5,4.8,23,"Lots of gorgeous blackberry and blueberry character with round, caressing tannins, vivid acidity and freshness. Lots of bright fruit and very pure character. From biodynamically grown grapes with Demeter certification. Drink and enjoy. Tasted before its release, the Duemani 2020 Cabernet Franc CiFRA was bottled in June and should hit the market shortly. This was a warm vintage, and I taste the ripeness of the fruit in the wine's thick layers of black cherry and blackberry. The wine offers ample fruit weight and discernible sweetness on the tannins. Winemaking takes this wine through cement vats and terracotta jars. The fruit is certified biodynamic and organic. "

1321,Yalumba The Octavius Old Vine Shiraz,2016,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,139,14.5,0.0,0,"This blend of Barossa Valley (67%) and Eden Valley fruit hails from five parcels averaging 80 years old, the oldest planted in 1854. Intensely concentrated in hue and muscular flavour. Spicy and mineral to the nose and palate, with glimpses of violets. Its iodine and liquorice-edged black cherry and blueberry flavour is succulent, but still in the grip of the sinewy, charry oak, making for an imposing, slightly austere finish. A powerhouse. Saturated ruby. Heady aromas of ripe dark berries, cherry liqueur, vanilla and incense, with smoky mineral and exotic spice accents building in the glass. Seamless in texture and deeply concentrated, offering palate-staining black and blue fruit, floral pastille and mocha flavors that turn sweeter with air. At once plush and lively, finishing extremely long and smoky, with repeating dark berry and floral notes and velvety tannins. There’s a stronger Barossa Valley expression in 2016 with ripe blackberry and dark-plum flavors delivering a very pure, focused fruit impression. Vibrant fruit purity here. The palate has gently grainy tannins and good weight. Fresh, succulent dark berries and an impressive, deep, driving finish. A blend of Barossa Valley 67% and Eden Valley 33 shiraz from very old vines. Drink or hold. For a wine named for the 90-liter barrels it was originally matured in, Yalumba's 2016 The Octavius displays relatively restrained oak. This vintage, only 50% of the volume aged in those small octaves for 20 months, with the rest in a mix of barriques and hogsheads (a mix of French and American), all of which were coopered at the winery—but only 28% of which were new. Cedar and vanilla notes accent mixed berries on the nose of this full-bodied effort, which comes from the Barossa (two-thirds) and Eden Valleys (one-third). Rich and velvety on the palate, it adds hints of dried spices, juniper berries and bay leaves on the long finish. The youngest vines were planted in 1951, the oldest in 1854. This is blended from vineyard parcels with an average age of 100 years, then aged in octaves – 100-liter barrels coopered from French oak at Yalumba. That small format oak gives the concentrated fruit an immediate richness, a fat wine bursting with cherry ripeness and the umami-tinged bitterness of flower petals. Stay with it and the cherry fruit turns plump and elegant, the wine’s richness shaped by fine tannins. This should age with grace. "

Hearty and rich, it has balance and concentration. The 2018 Chardonnay Sonoma Coast looks to be terrific, with a juicy, vibrant, medium-bodied style as well as classic lemon, melon, crushed stone, and white flower-like aromas and flavors. It picks up a beautiful salinity and saltiness on the finish and is going to evolve nicely for 3-5 years. Incredibly well-done, it displays classic Sonoma Coast character. "

1330,Chateau Fontenil,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,34,15,3.7,5,"The 2019 Château Fontenil is, I suspect, mostly Merlot, and it's another fine Fronsac in this vintage. Ripe black cherries, forest floor, Asian spices, and chocolate notes all emerge on the nose, and it's full-bodied, ripe, and sexy on the palate, with sweet tannins, no hard edges, and wonderful overall balance. It dishes out tons of pleasure and is a much more approachable, forward wine compared to the Le Défi de Fontenil while still possessing the class to evolve for 10-15 years. Best after 2022. Plenty of sweet-tobacco, graphite, and dark-berry aromas follow through to a medium to full body with attractive ripe fruit and chewy yet round tannins. It’s a little one-dimensional on the palate now, but will develop complexity and drinkability in a short time. Try after 2023. "

The Penfolds Club Tawny is a delicious fortified wine. The wine shows aromas and flavors reminiscent of Portos from Portugal. One may not even recognize the difference and could be surprised that this wine is a New World effort. The wine's cream, pruney, and rancio character—rancio is a recognized flavor descriptor that is often found in many Sherries—adds additional nuances that make the wine stand out. Drinks well now, and would be perfect with chocolate mousse or mild cigar. (Tasted: October 31, 2016, San Francisco, CA USA) "

Formerly at Bryant Family Vineyards, Alexander is known for making deeply concentrated wines from the estate vineyard set on Red Mountain. The 2018 vintage speaks to Alexander’s talents, as he has brilliantly captured the warmth and the textural elements that the growing season brought to producers. His 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Estate is the finest I have tasted here, pushing perfection in a bottle. Alexander’s new Mourvèdre and Tempranillo are some of the best single variety examples of these wines in North America. The aromas bring notes of fractured basalt, red and black fruit, moist earth, fresh herb and spice. Pillowy soft, textured, ripe, intense dark-fruit flavors follow. A long, lingering, fruit-filled finish caps it off. The appeal is as much about feel as flavor. It's a wild ride.

Planted almost 50 years ago, Poggetto di Sopra is Avignonesi’s historic vineyard, located in the area of Argiano at approximately 300 metres above sea level. The soil is marine in origin and rich in calcium carbonate. Macerated cherry speaks to the warmth and ripeness of 2017, and the nose is currently dominated by oak notes of vanilla, coconut and roasted coffee. On the palate intense fruit is countered by concentrated acidity and grainy tannins. This needs some time to allow its more subtle nuances to shine through. "

Winemaker and general manager Elizabeth Vianna first began working at Chimney Rock as a harvest intern in 1999, and has served as president of the Stags Leap District Winegrowers Association. Here she's crafted an elegant expression of the AVA, with plenty of power and drive. Lifted aromas of bright red and black berry, graphite and a sweet minty herbaceousness continue on the palate, alongside sandalwood, lavender and cassis. Supple, layered and brooding in rich red fruit, this wine is lush and energetic in its youth. Toasted oak adds notes of baking spice and vanilla to the grand, decadent style. A blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot, and the rest Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Stags Leap District shows the complex, perfumed, elegant style of this appellation nicely, with plenty of red and black fruits, notes of tobacco, chalky minerality, and spice, medium to full body, ripe tannins, and outstanding length. Chimney Rock's 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Stags Leap District is a blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon and 13% Merlot, with 2% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc. Aged 18 months in 50% new French oak, the wood is relatively restrained here, adding just hints of cedar and vanilla to the raspberry, cassis and cherry aromas.

They do a soft extraction in stainless steel using 20% full clusters and indigenous yeasts, achieving a wine with moderate alcohol (13.47%) and good freshness (pH 3.47). I felt like the wine had gone one step up in complexity and depth from the previous vintage; it's precise, harmonious, elegant and nuanced and keeps varietal purity.

It wears the name of a plot of Malbec in Medrano planted with old vines, which tends to be the warmest of their estate vineyards. It feels like the cooler 2014 climate compensated the heat of the place nicely, and the wine comes through as fresh. In Medrano the soils are quite heavy, so you have to take care to get healthy grapes, and it feels like the low yields avoided the problems with the summer rains; the wine is very clean.

This wine has a pretty floral component that underlines the delicate, elegant and streamlined personality of this classic Rosso. Production is 26,500 bottles and, interestingly, 350 magnums. Best after 2022. "

1401,Sloan Proprietary Red,2011,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,439,0,0.0,0,"Medium to deep garnet colored with a touch of purple, the 2011 Proprietary Red is a little youthfully closed, the nose slowly revealing beautiful lilacs and lavender scents with a core of blackcurrant cordial, blueberry pie and raspberry preserves plus wafts of oolong tea and forest floor. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is gracefully expressed with stacks of mineral, floral and black fruit layers and a firm, grainy frame, finishing long with lingering earthy sparks. So wonderfully elegant. "
1402,Concha y Toro Marques de Casa Concha Carmenere,2019,Carmenere,Chile,24,0,4.5,5,"Redcurrant, bell pepper, chili and tobacco on the nose. Full body with smooth tannins. Structured, yet juicy and playful in the mouth. Polished and creamy with pretty vanilla notes. Fresh and flavorful finish with good length. Drink or hold. All of Concha y Toro's Carmenere comes from Peumo, the classical zone for the grape in Cachapoal, from which they produced the impressive 2019 Marques de Casa Concha Carmenere, a wine that has improved tremendously in the last few years, controlling the ripeness and oaking. It's expressive and varietal, spicy and open, more subtle than the Gran Reserva but not as deep as the Terrunyo. This matured in French barriques and oak foudres for 12 months. "

1405,Calera Ryan Vineyard Pinot Noir,2008,Pinot Noir,California,75,14.9,0.0,0,"The 2008 Pinot Noir Ryan Vineyard comes across as soft, delicate and perfumed. Sweet red berries, crushed flowers, licorice and tobacco are some of the notes that flow from this understated Pinot. The Ryan Vineyard is already a touch forward, suggesting it is best enjoyed sooner rather than later. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2018. This bottling is always silky and accessible on release, and so it is with the 2008. It's lighter in color than most of the top Pinots, but very complex, with wild berry, mushroom, cola and spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Call it Burgundian. Lovely now as it warms in the glass, but will develop in the bottle. "

Layered flavors of chamomile and lavender at the beginning, but turns toward fresh cream and then the note of candied ginger on the nose returns. Linear and balanced. A golden yellow color in the glass, the 2020 Ch Chardonnay offers aromas of blown sand, yellow apple and pastry cream with elements of popcorn kernel and sweet citrus. Medium-bodied, the wine offers a delightful mineral and textural drive over the mid-palate before expressing a clean and delightful finish that delivers at a great price. The wine rested in 25% new French oak. "
1409,Chateau La Lagune,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,49,13.5,4.4,5,"The 2019 Château La Lagune is terrific and well worth seeking out. Ripe dark cherries, currants, smoky tobacco, and cedar pencil notes define this utterly classic, medium-bodied, balanced Haut-Médoc. With plenty of tannins as well as good concentration, it's going to hit maturity in 7-8 years and have two decades or more of longevity if properly stored. It's an impeccably put together wine. The blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot, and the balance Cabernet Franc. Best after 2029. Wafting from the glass with aromas of cherries, wild berries and cassis mingled with hints of dark chocolate, pencil shavings and violets, the 2019 La Lagune is medium to full-bodied, broad and sensual, its ample core of fruit framed by polished tannins and succulent acids.

1410,Meyer-Fonne Dorfburg Pinot Gris,2019,Pinot Gris/Grigio,France,38,14,0.0,0,"A rather cool and delicate nose for an Alsace pinot gris with floral-honey and fresh-herb notes. Much richer on the palate than expected, but this is properly dry and the acidity is almost crisp at the finish ,where any trace of opulence vanishes and delicacy returns.  "

1413,Paolo Scavino Barolo Cannubi,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,109,15,0.0,0,"Very floral nose with bright red berries, some cedary oak and and an exotic hint of musk. Medium-to full-bodied with intense, spicy fruit flavors against a backdrop of lightly firm and lightly grainy tannins that together produce surprising length. Well poised and showing good pedigree, despite the difficult vintage. This will age nicely, but is great to taste now.  Packaged with a black label, the Paolo Scavino 2018 Barolo Cannubi opens to a delicate and luminous appearance with lifted aromas wild rose, lilac, wild berry and crushed stone. The wine shows great depth and complexity compared to some of the more subdued wines found in this vintage. This is one for the cellar. Best After 2024 Wild herb, iris, red berry and oak-driven spice aromas come to the forefront. Full-bodied but with so much finesse it seems almost weightless, the taut, tense palate features ripe Morello cherry, raspberry compote, coconut and licorice before closing on a hint of espresso. Tightly knit, close-grained tannins provide firm support while bright acidity keeps it vibrant. Drink 2028. "
1414,Grossot Chablis Vaucoupin Premier Cru,2018,Chardonnay,France,50,13,0.0,0,"The initial whiff of this wine combines chalk, passion fruit and a milky floral overtone. The palate wraps these notions in fine, ripe lemon zestiness, focusing on midpalate texture rather than fruit. The body is rounded and yeasty, with a lovely, lemony, chalky depth that lends coolness. The finish is all bright, long, soothing lemon. Alluring aromas of oyster shell and briny seashore draw you in, while flavors of white peach and apple, with a saline savoriness, hold your attention. This white is underlined by well-integrated acidity that leaves a juicy impression on the long complex finish. Drink now through 2024. "

1416,Montsarra Cava,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Spain,20,11.5,3.8,28,"Bosky apple scents and flavors of clotted cream imply richness, but the wine cuts that with Spanish severity, finishing on the flavor of Marcona alamonds, briny and tight. "
1417,Marciano Estate M Proprietary Red,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,139,0,0.0,0,"I loved the 2018 M Proprietary Red Wine, another gorgeous wine from this tiny estate. Lots of crème de cassis, blueberries, iron, and a kiss of crushed stone-like minerality give way to a deep, full-bodied, concentrated wine with plenty of baby fat mostly concealing sound underlying structure. A blend of equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, it's going to take 7-8 years to shed some fruit but should be long lived. With 35% Cabernet Franc planted on the 10-acre vineyard at Marciano Estate, this M label showcases the extra proportion of this grape. The 2018 M by Marciano is a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 50% Cabernet Franc. Displaying a deep purple-black color, it rockets out of the glass with vibrant notions of blackcurrant pastilles, re currant jelly, kirsch and pencil shavings with hints of dusty soil, bouquet garni and wet pebbles. Full-bodied, rich and seductively fruity in the mouth, it has finely pixelated tannins and a lively backbone, finishing with fantastic length and lots of mineral sparks. Give it another couple of years in bottle to really strut its stuff, and drink it over the next 25 years+. "

1422,Tenuta Sant'Anna Prosecco Extra,Dry,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Italy,14,11,0.0,0,"The NV Prosecco Extra Dry shows a dusty display of white flowers, ripe peach and a hint of tangerine. It’s pleasantly sweet, balanced by vibrant acids and hints of lime. This cleans up nicely through the finale, lingering on green citrus and a flourish of inner florals. It’s so easy to like and a great example of the pleasurable balance obtainable in the Extra Dry category. "
1423,Albert Bichot Gevrey-Chambertin,2019,Pinot Noir,France,99,0,0.0,0,"This lithe red is packed with ripe cherry, strawberry and floral aromas and flavors, allied to a supple texture. Firms up as it builds to a lingering finish, remaining fresh and balanced. Very charming and long. Drink now. "

It's quite smooth and balanced, and very long on the finish. Avoids all the pitfalls of sweet Sherry by maintaining its balance and mouthfeel. "
1426,Domaine Meo-Camuzet Nuits-Saint-Georges Aux Boudots Premier Cru,2020,Pinot Noir,France,309,0,0.0,0,"The 2020 Nuits Saint-Georges Les Boudots 1er Cru has a very expressive bouquet with ebullient red and blue fruit combined with violet and crushed stone scents. The palate is medium-bodied with fine grain tannins, nicely poised with quite a strict finish that indicates that this will need some bottle age. "
1427,Chateau Leoville Las Cases,1995,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,359,0,0.0,0,"If it were not for the prodigious 1996, everyone would be concentrating on getting their hands on a few bottles of the fabulous 1995 Leoville-Las-Cases, which is one of the vintage's great success stories. The wine boasts an opaque ruby/purple color, and exceptionally pure, beautifully knit aromas of black fruits, minerals, vanillin, and spice. On the attack, it is staggeringly rich, yet displays more noticeable tannin than its younger sibling. Exceptionally ripe cassis fruit, the judicious use of toasty new oak, and a thrilling mineral character intertwined with the high quality of fruit routinely obtained by Las Cases, make this a compelling effort. There is probably nearly as much tannin as in the 1996, but it is not as perfectly sweet as in the 1996. The finish is incredibly long in this classic. Only 35% of the harvest was of sufficient quality for the 1995 Leoville-Las-Cases. Pure violets, minerals and blackberries on the nose. Full-bodied, chewy and powerful. Still holding back a lot. This wine needs to break its chains. Give it time. "
1428,Meiomi Cabernet,Sauvignon,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,26,13.7,3.9,42,"COMMENTARY: The Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon is layered and drinks easily.

1429,Chateau Clerc Milon,1998,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,149,0,0.0,0,"A superb effort, the 1998 may be the finest Clerc-Milon I have tasted. A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Franc, and 3% Petit Verdot, this is a blockbuster, over-sized offering for this estate. Full-bodied and super-extracted, with power to burn, this rich, concentrated wine demands 7-8 years of cellaring. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2025. "
1430,Lavinea Elton Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,Oregon,79,13.7,0.0,0,"Sleek and vibrant, with tiers of black raspberry, savory dark tea and dusky spice flavors that take on richness toward polished tannins. Drink now through 2028. Robust and tangy flavors propel a juicy mix of citrus and berry, notably orange and strawberry. The use of native yeast and the light touch with 22% new oak barrels are part of the winery's signature style, which focuses on single-vineyard examples from older plantings among the Willamette Valley's most interesting AVAs. Lightly savory and finishing with a touch of cocoa, this fragrant and rather restrained wine should be enjoyed over the next half decade. Attractive, spiced violets and wild herbs on offer with a fresh, red-fruit core. The mid-weight palate has dry, spiced red-cherry flavors and neat, fine tannins. "

Rich yet balanced, it shows a depth of flavor that never gets overly fussy. Based on close to an even split of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Malbec, all from the Oak Knoll District in the southern part of the valley, the 2018 Red Blend Trail 3150 offers a complex, medium-bodied, floral style that carries lots of red and blue fruits, notes of menthol, spring flowers, and cedar, light tannins, a juicy spine of acidity, and a great finish. It's a pretty, elegant wine to enjoy over the coming 10-15 years. Rich, savory aromas of stewed black cherries, rosemary and cloves. Chocolate and walnut, too. It’s full-bodied with firm, smooth tannins. Easy-going. Drink or hold. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Experience Trail 3150 Proprietary Red is nicely layered and well-built.

1432,Chateau Bellefont Belcier,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,49,13.95,0.0,0,"Very attractive plum and cherry aromas with hints of flowers and wet earth, following through to a medium to full body with linear, polished tannins and a juicy finish. Juicy fruit to finish with some minerality and forest-flower undertones. A little tight, but very pure at the end. Drink after 2025.	 A beautiful, elegant Saint-Emilion that will be loved by both modernists and traditionalists out there, the 2019 Château Bellefont-Belcier comes from a south-facing, limestone terroir just beside Château Pavie and Larcis Ducasse. A blend of 70% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc, and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, it starts out reticent and understated yet builds beautifully with time in the glass and has wonderful cassis and black raspberry fruits intermixed with notes of truffle, tobacco, damp earth, and violets. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has silky tannins, perfect overall balance, and a great finish. It's not a powerhouse, but it shines for its purity, finesse, and elegance. Drink bottles over the coming 15-20 years or so. Best after 2022. From a beautifully situated hillside vineyard, sandwiched between Larcis Ducasse and Tertre Roteboeuf on either side, with holdings belonging to Pavie and Troplong Mondot on the plateau above, the 2019 Bellefont Belcier has turned out very well indeed. Offering up aromas of smoky berry fruit, loamy soil, subtle spices, black truffle and violets, it's full-bodied, velvety and seamless, with a vibrant, enveloping profile and a long, penetrating finish. This is a terrific effort, though given the thoughtful farming and program of replanting that is underway at this long-neglected estate, I suspect it only hints at what is to come as Jean-Christophe Meyrou and his team get to work. Best after 2025. "
1433,Barruol Lynch Hermitage Blanc La Pierrelle,2017,Marsanne,France,109,13.5,0.0,0,"Pale yellow-gold. Mineral-drenched pear, lemon pith and ginger qualities on the pungent nose; jasmine, fennel and chamomile nuances add complexity.

Fine, nuanced and refined, it's a Grand Cru red that whispers rather than shouts with understated wood and savoury floral red berry fruit. The tannins are a delight. "

Medium to full body, firm and silky tannins and a savory finish. Delicate finish. The 2014 Bolgheri Superiore Guado Al Tasso offers more excellent surprises from this underdog vintage. Its deep, velvety color stands out first. This is an immensely soft and smooth red blend from the Bolgheri area on the Tuscan Coast. The wine opens to dark fruit aromas with background notes of spice, sweet tobacco and dark cacao. The tannins are refined and smooth with succulent end notes of ripe fruit and blackberry. The wine's texture is thicker and more elaborate than you might initially suspect. In fact, very little here indicates that 2014 was a cold and difficult vintage. Due to severe fruit selection, production of this wine is down by 30%.

Blended with 4% Viognier and aged in 50% new oak, it’s ideal for drinking any time over the coming 4-6 years. Gamy aromas of lamb and charcuterie are spiced by pepper and pair with smoked and roasted figs on the nose of this bottling, which also offers a salty iodine element. There's a smoked seaweed flavor on the sip, which contributes a savory streak to the roasted black-plum and rich coffee components. "
1443,Domaine Olivier Hillaire Chateauneuf-du-Pape Les Petits Pieds d'Armand,2018,Rhone Red Blends,France,100,0,0.0,0,"All Grenache from a sandy portion of La Crau and aged in 400-liter barrels, the 2018 Chateauneuf du Pape Les Petits Pieds d'Armand is darker and richer than the Les Terrasses bottling (off galets roulés). Concentrated and intense, it delivers scents of black cherries and garrigue, tinged with hints of dark chocolate and cinnamon. Full-bodied, velvety and rich, it finishes long, with less apparent heat on the finish than the Les Terrasses, and probably a bit more longevity. The 2018 Châteauneuf du Pape Les Petits Pieds D’Armand is even better, offering additional mid-palate depth as well as richness. Based on 100% old vine Grenache from the famed La Crau lieu-dit, vinified in concrete, and aged all on older used barrels, its deeper ruby hue is followed by an incredible Provençal bouquet of mulled red and black fruits, candied flowers, orange blossom, and spice. With full-bodied richness, a stacked mid-palate, no hard edges, and a great, great finish, this is unquestionably one of the sexiest wines in the vintage. It will put a smile on your face any time over the coming 10-15 years. A fairly pale colour. Fresh, elegant, cherry-scented start, a little orange zest and raspberry. Generous in glycerol, quite jellied on the palate. The acidity helps to cut through the fat and alcohol – and the alcohol is high. Tannins however are fairly gentle and slight, classic of a sandy terroir. Ripe and solaire, very 2018, but has elegance and admirable freshness. 2,500 bottles made. Vines of over 100 years of age, a 1.2ha parcel of sand on the north of lieu-dit La Crau. Fermented in concrete, aged in old barriques. "

This beauty just about jumps out of the glass with its Provençal aromatics of ripe cherries, ground pepper, saddle leather, garrigue, and spice.

1469,Quinta do Noval Vintage Port,2015,Port,Portugal,110,19.5,0.0,0,"Exquisite aromas of blackberry, stone, violet and blueberry. Lead pencil too. Ink. Full body, chewy and linear with super polished yet intense tannins and a long and flavorful finish. Classic Noval character through a direct punch to the palate. This needs at least until 2022 to open but already excellent. Noval, one of the showpiece estates of the Douro, releases vintages in most years. This wine gives a fine reflection of what is, in fact, a great vintage which was almost a general declaration. It is impressive, ripe with generous black fruits and a fine balance between the spirit and the rich structure and fruit. It is going to mature quickly in the sense that it can be drunk within the next five years. It will also age for several decades. This is very polished in feel, with long, caressing, fine-grained structure that allows plum eau-de-vie, boysenberry puree and blackberry cobbler notes to play out at their leisure. Light anise and ganache hints accent the finish while the fruit blazes through. Rock 'em, sock 'em Port. Best from 2030 through 2045. The 2015 Vintage Port is the normal blend of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinto Cão and Sousão, all from the estate, that spent 18 months in barrel. This full-bodied, rich, opulent effort offers textbook plum and raisined fruits with loads of candied black olives, orange rind, and spice. Despite its richness and depth, it’s surprisingly fresh and lively, with integrated acidity, sensational purity of fruit, and a brilliant sense of elegance. It needs a decade of cellaring and will keep for 3-4 more decades. "

1475,Addendum Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,95,14.9,0.0,0,"The 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley) is soft, plush and inviting. Dark cherry, plum, mocha and licorice all open up in this easygoing, tasty Napa Valley Cabernet. All the elements fall into place so nicely. In fact, the appellation Cabernet is my favorite wine in the range. Soft and supple red fruit dominates in this robustly ripe, oak-driven wine, brimming in cassis and currant. Lengthy and integrated, it delivers full-bodied intensity with richness to spare. From Napa Valley and all Cabernet Sauvignon aged 25 months in 24% new French oak, the 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley has a pretty, classic Cabernet nose of darker fruits, tobacco, sappy green herbs, and cedarwood. Nicely textured, medium-bodied, and elegant on the palate, this beautifully done Cabernet excels in this difficult vintage. "
1476,Albert Bichot Chablis Les Lys Premier Cru Domaine Long-Depaquit,2019,Chardonnay,France,64,13,0.0,0,"Lemony chalkiness is faint on this wine's shy nose. The palate paints a fuller picture, using the broad strokes of lemon to reveal brightness, depth and chalky coolness. This wine still needs to knit its divergent parts together but all the elements are there. A touch of smoky reduction masks the bulk of the aromas save for delicate citrus nuances so I would suggest decanting this first. Otherwise there is notably better refinement to the well -detailed and energetic flavors that possess a finer texture on the refreshing if only moderately complex finale. "

Open-textured, with a juicy richness to the dark cherry and plum tart flavors, which are supported by firm acidity and tannins. This has subtle tea and cola accents that linger on the fresh finish. Drink now through 2026. The 2019 Pinot Noir Tilton Hill is a bigger, richer wine offering loads of spice, licorice, scorched earth, and black raspberry.

1483,Gilbert Picq Chablis Dessus La Carriere,2019,Chardonnay,France,36,0,0.0,0,"The 2019 Chablis Dessus La Carrière, bottled just after the Vosgros, has a detailed, arresting oyster-shell-scented bouquet, strict and penetrating. The palate is well balanced and has put on a little more weight during its élevage. There are still those Granny Smith and oyster shell notes, and more spiciness during the aftertaste (this trait was accentuated on another bottle that had been opened a week earlier).  The 2019 Chablis Dessus la Carrière opens in the glass with notions of citrus zest, white flowers, crisp orchard fruit and beeswax. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and chiseled, with lively acids and a long, saline finish, it's concentrated and structured to age. "
1484,Domaine Anderson Estate Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,50,13.2,0.0,0,"The 2018 Pinot Noir Estate is a very pretty wine that melds together the various signatures of the estate vineyards. Savor and deep, with terrific persistence, the Estate naturally does not offer the singularity of the vineyard designates, and yet it is a wonderfully complete wine. Dried herbs, tobacco, cedar crushed autumn leaves, plum and dark spice fill out the layers effortlessly. A herbal nose with notes of black cherry and strawberry as well. Medium-bodied with integrated tannins. Tart red fruit. Fresh. D "
1485,Vieux Chateau Certan,2009,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,430,13.7,0.0,0,"This is a wine that had extreme intensity of electrifying tannins and acidity, with supercharged fruit. Full-bodied, yet agile and lively. It touches every taste bud on your palate. Chocolate mousse and fruit. I am lost for words. Legendary 1950 all over again. Try it in 2020. The 2009's nearly 14% natural alcohol, exquisite ripeness, and incredible complex bouquet of Asian spices, fruitcake, licorice, smoke, blackberries and black currants are to die for. A blend of 84% Merlot and the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, it possesses a viscous texture as well as a freshness and vibrancy that are remarkable given the wine’s weight, richness and potential massiveness. This extraordinary effort is one of the finest Vieux Chateau Certans made over the last sixty years. It will undoubtedly shut down in bottle, requiring a decade or more of cellaring. It should keep for 50 years thereafter. Proprietor Thienpont thinks it is a modern day version of the 1948. This shows gorgeous silk and polish, brimming with beguiling plum, cherry eau de vie and red currant fruit flavors laced with supple toasty vanilla and cedar hints. But in the background brews a darker side, with loam, maduro tobacco and iron notes, which take over on the finish authoritatively. This feels like it will get a lot bigger before it fully melds—and that will be a while. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2018 through 2035. "
1486,Sean Minor 4B Pinot Noir,2020,Pinot Noir,California,15,13.5,4.0,14,"Elegant and easy, but interesting and complex, too, this medium-bodied wine made from Central Coast and North Coast vineyards blends light oak spices like cinnamon and toast with delicious, tangy and ripe black cherry flavors. "
1487,Petit & Bajan Ambrosie Brut Grand,Cru,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,49,12,0.0,0,"A 70-30 blend of chardonnay and pinot noir, this wine shares the tiny, persistent line of bubbles apparent in all the Petit & Bajan Champagnes we tasted. Here, those bubbles drive pale scents of apple flesh and hints of rosy red fruit. Touched by oxidative richness, the main takeaway is a pure limestone clarity in the wine’s mineral tension. With almost five years of aging on its lees, this is now a rich mature wine. It has a toasty, spicy character to balance the still-vibrant white-fruit flavors. The acidity is a foil to the richness of the wine, cutting through and giving a crisp, always mature aftertaste. An expressive nose of full-on citrus, quinine, green apple and discreet yeast influences gives way to delicious, vibrant and relatively full-bodied flavors that are supported by a fine but firm mousse. I very much like the depth on the lingering finish that is quite dry without being austere. For my taste, this would best be held for a few years because not only is it quite youthful, but I suspect that more complexity will develop with a few years of bottle age. Based on 70% Chardonnay and 30% Pinot Noir, the NV Grand Cru Brut Ambrosie has a pure, clean bouquet of apple blossom and tangerine-like fruits, white flowers, spice, and ample salty minerality. Textured, medium to full-bodied, and beautifully balanced, this is another terrific effort. COMMENTARY: Champagne Petit & Bajan Ambrosie is lovely and delicate on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of wild strawberries and fragrant flowers. Try it with lightly grilled salmon fillets.

1491,Chateau Clos Marsalette,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,29,14.1,4.5,5,"Aromas of blackcurrants, blackberries, graphite, iodine, wet earth, tar and black tea. Some green olives and dried herbs. It’s medium-bodied with firm, fine-grained tannins. Balanced and fresh. Classically structured. Drink from 2025. Features the lush cassis, mulled plum and boysenberry compote profile of the vintage, along with a fresh mineral streak as well as juniper and savory hints that give it some distinction. Alluring but on the languid side, which is the theme for Pessac in 2019. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Drink now. Offering up aromas of sweet wild berries, rose petals, orange rind, wood smoke and loamy soil, the 2019 Clos Marsalette is medium to full-bodied, fleshy and charming, with a sweet core of fruit, melting tannins and a lively, succulent profile. Cabernet Sauvignon represents some 50% of the blend at this small Pessac-Léognan estate. Best after 2021. "
1492,Chateau Pavie,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,399,14.5,4.9,14,"For me, this redefines Pavie. The depth and intensity and more important, the clarity, is really something. Full and ultra-fine tannins. It shows such great tannins and finesse. It is the essences of Pavie. Pure perfection in a glass and unquestionably one of the great vintages for this cuvée, the 2015 Pavie is a blend of 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc, and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon that was brought up in 80% new French oak. Sharing some similarities with the 2009, this tour de force sports a saturated purple color as well as a sweet bouquet of crème de cassis, crushed rocks, white truffle, and licorice. Its oak is perfectly integrated and balanced by this wine’s massive fruit and structure. Full-bodied, deep, and superbly concentrated, with building tannins, it’s a massive wine by any measure, but what sets it apart is that it still glides across the palate and retains an incredible sense of purity, balance, and elegance. It’s drinking well today due to the vintage’s opulence, yet won’t hit prime time for another 5-10 years and I suspect will keep for upward of 50 years. In 2015, the blend is 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, and the wine was matured 80% in new French oak. Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2015 Pavie is still sporting a bit of its oak to begin, giving way to a glorious nose of crushed black cherries, blackberries and mulberries plus hints of dried roses, stewed tea, unsmoked cigars and garrigue. The rich, concentrated, full-bodied palate delivers an incredible structure of very firm, very ripe tannins and a racy line of freshness cutting through the dense layers of perfumed black fruits and savory notions, finishing with epic length.

TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of wild strawberries and a hint of chalk. Enjoy it with a flavorful lamb stew. (Tasted: October 21, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Delivers a core of juicy, vibrant cherry, cranberry and pomegranate notes, with tomato leaf, spice, white pepper, tobacco and a hint of cocoa on the velvety finish. On the richer, darker end of the spectrum, this well-priced Pinot offers powerful potpourri aromas that sit atop vibrant red fruit, savory spice and a sanguine character. Somewhat meaty, mealy oak lingers beneath. In the mouth, the red fruit and spice feel fresh, even if the acidity is a little sharp. Chiseled, savory tannins add some heft.

The showy 2018 Malbec Finca Bella Vista shows a similar profile as the rest of the single-vineyard bottlings, as they follow a similar process: picking ripe fruit from low-yielding old vines and aging in brand new oak, and both things seem to have a big impact in the profile of the wine. It's ripe and concentrated with notes of dry herbs and abundant and slightly dusty tannins. "
1499,Butternut Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,15,13.5,3.5,17,"Spicy blackberry and sage are dotted with cedar in
this harmoniously balanced wine, which also shows notes
of red plum, espresso, and bittersweet dark chocolate. Good tannin structure is evident. Aged in 25% new French
oak. "
1500,Murgo Brut Rose,2019,Sparkling Rosé,Italy,28,0,0.0,0,"The Scammacca del Murgo family has been making traditional-method sparkling wines from Mt. Etna’s native nerello mascalese since 1990. Their rosé, which gains its delicate salmon color from direct press of the red grapes, rested for three years in bottle on the lees, developing toasty notes that complement the wine’s flavors of tart cherry, cranberry and blood orange. Lingering saline notes point to the wine’s volcanic origin, and it finishes clean and bright, ready for a range of seafood or salty appetizers. The 2019 Brut Rosé Metodo Classico, a varietal Nerello Mascalese vinified white, lifts from the glass with a sweetly scented mix of dried strawberries, roses, hints of cinnamon sugar and smoke. It boasts a silken bead of fine bubbles that massage the palate with notions of ripe pit fruits, hints of white cherry and confectionary spice. This leaves the senses completely refreshed and squeaky clean, with a gentle tug of minerality that seals the deal. The 2019 Brut is stunning and a great entry-level Champagne alternative. "
1501,Parducci Small Lot Petite Sirah,2020,Petite Sirah,California,18,15,4.0,22,"Packed with boysenberries and black figs, this rich and full-bodied wine is quite drinkable due to a velvety texture of fine-grained tannins that supports the extreme fruitiness in a way that balances the wine nicely. Best 2023–2030. "
1502,Salicutti Brunello di Montalcino Piaggione,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,129,14,0.0,0,"Game, camphor and blue flower aromas make their way to the forefront along with crushed fennel seed. The firm, elegantly structured palate offers juicy strawberry, blood orange and star anise alongside baking spice accompanied by taut, polished tannins. Bright acidity keeps it lifted and fresh. Drink 2024–2029. This supple red is marked by macerated cherry, plum, fruit cake, floral and leather aromas and flavors. Lively and balanced, with a light coating of tannins on the long aftertaste. Best from 2024   The Salicutti 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Piaggione (closed with a black wax capsule) is pure and genuine in character, but it also shows simple lines and not as much depth as we saw in the previous vintage. However, if the goal in 2017 was to avoid overt ripeness or heaviness, those two objectives have been accomplished quite successfully in this wine. Aromas of wild cherry, rose and grilled herb are lifted and pretty, and the wine shows varietal character that is especially pure. Fruit comes from the tiny Piaggione vineyard, which measures just over a hectare and is farmed meticulously by hand. "
1503,Clos du Caillou Cotes du Rhone Rouge Reserve,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,56,0,0.0,0,"In the same ballpark, the 2020 Côtes Du Rhône Reserve has a perfumed nose of spiced red and black fruits, as well as plenty of peppery, garrigue, and subtle meaty notes. Medium-bodied and elegant on the palate, it doesn't have the density or depth of prior vintages but is still an outstanding wine. "

Floral, mineral and tobacco elements add depth as this cruises to a long finish. Shows terrific balance and energy. Best from 2024 through 2040.

The palate has the weight and width of Nuits with a very succulent, juicy red-cherry core and good drive on the finish.  "

Cedar, tobacco, licorice, dried herbs and crushed leaves lend aromatic nuance to a core of bright, red-toned fruit. There is terrific energy here, and plenty of personality too. The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Vogelzang Vineyard is all varietal and spent 20 months in barrel. Its ruby/plum color gives way to a concentrated, medium-bodied, balanced red offering both red and black fruits, notes of cedarwood, tobacco, and sagebrush, supple tannins, and a good finish. A solid, outstanding Cabernet Sauvignon, it can be drunk any time over the coming 15 years or so. "

1511,Sixto Frenchman Hills Chardonnay,2017,Chardonnay,Washington,55,14.5,0.0,0,"Plenty of sliced apple and pear aromas with hints of cream and vanilla. Full-bodied, layered and nicely oily with a long, flavorful finish. Dried fruit and candied lemon at the end. All about purity of fruit. Drink or hold. Pale gold colored, the 2017 Chardonnay Frenchman Hills Vineyard seems the most subdued of the range this year, having faint hints of apple blossom, seared pears and citrus peel. Medium-bodied, the palate is short, straightforward and mineral-laden and leaves me wanting more vibrancy and precision before ending with a soft phenolic finish. "
1512,Enrique Mendoza Alicante La Tremenda Monastrell,2018,Mourvedre,Spain,15,14.5,3.7,51,"The incredible value 2018 La Tremenda is pure Monastrell from 26-year-old vines on sandy and silt soils covered with rolling stones. It fermented in stainless steel and aged in French oak barrels for six months. It's a more delicate expression of Monastrell, with good balance, quite transparent; it was easy, and the wines have very good freshness, with less concentration but terrific balance and definition, quite fruit-driven but with complexity and depth. It's approachable, really good for an entry level and amazing for the price. This is really impressive. An honest Monastrell. "
1513,Chateau Les Ormes de Pez,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,31,14,0.0,0,"Coming from the Cazes team, the 2019 Château Ormes De Pez is gorgeous and shines in the vintage. Pure crème de cassis, mulberries, leafy herbs, Asian spices, and lead pencil all emerge on the nose, and this medium to full-bodied 2019 has the vintage’s pure, focused, elegant style while staying ripe, supple, and textured. The balance is spot on, and it's going to hit maturity in roughly 8-10 years and have two decades of prime drinking. Best After 2030 COMMENTARY: The 2019 Château Ormes de Pez is firm and satisfying. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of black fruit, rustic spices, and oaky notes. Pair it with Argentine-style grilled ribeye.

It has juicy, savory character with a creamy texture. Merlot, cabernet sauvignon and malbec. Drink or hold. In the same qualitative ballpark as the 2018, the 2019 Château Bourdieu N1 has a deeper ruby hue as well as a meaty, mouth-filling, medium-bodied style including classic notes of ripe red and black fruits, tobacco, leather, and assorted spices. The balance is spot on, it has terrific purity, and it possesses the structure and class to evolve for a solid decade. Best after 2022. "
1516,Owen Roe Ex Umbris Syrah,2020,Syrah/Shiraz,Washington,25,14.1,0.0,0,"Aromas of cherry, suede and sage. Vivid and full-bodied on the palate with a lovely nutty, poppy-seed note coming through. Charcoal and earth, too. Velvety tannins. "

1520,Chateau Puygueraud,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,18,13.5,3.8,64,"Aromas of blackberries, dried lavender, black olives, tobacco, herbs and some smoked meat. It’s medium-to full-bodied with firm, fine-grained tannins. Layered and concentrated with a sleek, savory finish. 85% merlot, 12% cabernet franc and 3% malbec. Better from 2022. Coming from the talented Thienpont team, the 2018 Château Puygueraud is a juicy, up-front, undeniably delicious 2018 offering lots of perfumed, floral, and violet notes, sumptuous blue fruits, medium-bodied richness, and a juicy, balanced, lengthy style that keeps you coming back to the glass. The balance is spot on, as is the purity of fruit, and it's ideal for enjoying any time over the coming decade. The blend is 85% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Franc and the rest Malbec. Lightly structured and certainly perfumed, this wine has hints of minerality as well as a strong herbal element. It will take a while to develop fully, but it is enjoyable now. "
1521,Alpha Omega Era,2009,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,499,14,0.0,0,"The 2009 Era is made up of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Petit Verdot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot. Deep garnet colored, it is a little broody to begin, unfurling slowly to reveal loads of enticingly savory notes of grilled meats, sautéed herbs, dried wild mushrooms and pain grille with a core of blackcurrant cordial, blackberry pie and preserved plum plus wafts of dried mint and star anise. Medium to full-bodied, the palate has bags of elegance and grace with layers of earthy and savory nuances and a good core of black fruit preserves, flanked by firm, fine-grained tannins, finishing with a quiet intensity. Delicious now, this wine should continue to give a lot of pleasure over the next 10+ years. "
1522,Sottimano Barbaresco Cotta,2019,Nebbiolo,Italy,79,14,0.0,0,"Extremely perfumed and bright, with ripe strawberry, orange peel and white truffle. Some roses, too. Full-bodied with layers of ripe fruit and excellent structure behind. This is a fantastic Barbaresco for the vintage. The fruit expression of this wine is dark, with black cherry and blackberry flavors that are backed by vivid acidity and mingle with tar and underbrush. Delivers powerful tannins that dominate the finish, though they're not overly astringent. Still, this lacks the harmony of the best at this stage and will require additional time to find its sweet spot. Best from 2026. "
1523,Boekenhoutskloof Semillon,2019,Semillon,Africa,54,13.2,0.0,0,"A wonderfully perfumed nose of beeswax, green apple, fleshy peach and charred thyme. Medium-bodied with silky, rich texture. Expressive and incredibly succulent with subtle but driving acidity that pushes the palate through a persistent finish. Gentle tannins give structure and focus. Delicious. Sustainable. The 2019 Sémillon, one of my favorite cuvées from this producer, has a wonderful bouquet of peach skin and orange blossom scents, all extremely well defined. The balanced palate offers superb concentration on the entry, flavors of praline mixed with citrus fruit and almond, and an almost resinous note toward the finish. It’s tempting to drink this now, but it deserves 3–5 years in bottle. "
1524,Schrader RBS To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,399,0,0.0,0,"Lots of violets, flowery incense, cassis, and spice notes emerge from the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard RBS, a full-bodied, silky, elegant 2019 that shines just as much for its purity and balance as its richness and depth. Possessing good acidity, a lively, vibrant mouthfeel, supple tannins, and a great finish, it has plenty of up-front appeal yet should easily evolve for a solid 20 years if properly stored. Best After 2021 Racy, dark nose with pulpy character. Dried lychee, lavender and sandalwood. This is quite juicy, ample and almost a bit ethereal, despite the color and high alcohol. There is a fine twist of salinity on the palate that runs smoothly with lots of purple flowers. Really immaculate. Almost soft texture.  Gushes with pure violet, plum and cassis notes, all flecked with hints of black tea, anise and sassafras. Driven, with a graphite underpinning providing a spine that stays in the background as the fruit stretches out. Approachable already but no rush at all. Drink now "

1527,Le Ragnaie Ragnaie Vigna Vecchia Brunello di Montalcino (1.5 Liter Magnum),2017,Sangiovese,Italy,329,0,0.0,0,"The V. V. stands for old vines. With fruit from 50-year-old plants, the Le Ragnaie 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Ragnaie V. V. is one of three black-label special selections made by this estate. Instead of a Riserva program, Le Ragnaie focuses on territorial identity and single-vineyard expressions. This pretty wine shows the distinctive concentration that comes from the old vines, but that is also a result of the hot growing season. Dark fruit, rose, spice and baked clay emerge from this medium to full-bodied Brunello. At a cool 600 metres with a warm southwest exposure, Le Ragnaie’s oldest vines were planted in 1968. It seems to have more of everything in 2017. You can almost smell the warmth as wild blackcurrant and tar waft from the glass. It's a chewier expression than the rest of the estate’s single-vineyard bottlings, though the tannins still exhibit their signature tight austerity. Just a touch of dryness pokes through but there is plenty of fruit concentration to carry this as it assumes a more graceful gait. A sinewy version, featuring black cherry and black currant flavors enmeshed in dense, dusty tannins. Nonetheless, this is vibrant and fluid, staying focused through the long, chalky finish. Best from 2025  "
1528,Bouchard Pere & Fils Pommard Premier Cru,2017,Pinot Noir,France,125,0,0.0,0,"This is a blend of fruit from two estate parcels (Clanlain and Combe), with 20 percent coming from other plots farmed by Bouchard; all of the vines are between 50 and 70 years old. The wine is fresh and tightly built, a powerful young Burgundy that needs patience in a decanter or long aging in bottle to show itself. The oak presence comes first, with sandalwood scents over grapey intensity. Then, as it unpacks, the wine shows the gracious aristocracy of Pommard, a delicate power built on layers of floral tannins and luscious dark fruit. This is ripe and juicy, with bright acidity defining the black cherry, plum, oak spice and fruit cake aromas and flavors. Hints of licorice and leather flash on the lingering aftertaste. Drink now through 2033.  "

1531,Siro Pacenti Brunello di Montalcino Vecchie Vigne,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,129,14.5,0.0,0,"Such wonderful opulence and beauty. The nose shows dried flowers and minerals with blackberries and black cherries. Purity is the word. Full-bodied with incredible depth and structure and polished, silky tannins that envelop your palate. The length is really impressive. Try after 2025. The 2016 Vecchie Vigne Brunello is introspective and complex on the nose, with tobacco, baked earth, dried black plum, cedar, and lavender. The palate is concentrated and brooding, with cola, balsamic black fruit, and tea leaf, and the wine is full-bodied, with chiseled structure, powerful tannin, and balanced acidity. Spending two years in French oak of 225 liters, the oak influence is present but has finesse and is well-integrated for the style. This wine warrants time in the cellar and will be fantastic drinking for those who gravitate to a more polished, modern style. 2025-2040. Menthol, new leather, French oak and spiced blueberry aromas come to the forefront. Full bodied and concentrated, the firmly structured palate delivers dried cherry, grilled Porcini, vanilla and licorice set against assertive, close-grained tannins before closing on a coconut note. Give it time to flesh out in the bottle. Drink 2026–2036. I tasted this wine from barrel a few years back, and it's great to follow up on its evolution. Looking back at my notes, I remarked on the generosity, depth and fruit-driven bounty of the Siro Pacenti 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Vecchie Vigne. Those are the same words I would use to describe the wine today. Indeed, they could sum up the house style that underlines concentration, careful berry selection and an elaborate oak regimen with new French barrique. Fruit from old vines represents a blend of two sites, one with rocky soils to the south and another with clay soils to the north. This wine opens to a nicely saturated appearance with dark berry, spice and tobacco. The wine is structured and firm, owning its tannins to both the fruit and the barrique. I do find the tannins to be astringent at this young stage, so I would hold off from opening this 25,000-bottle release for a long while. Like many of the other producers in Montalcino, Giancarlo Pacenti has captured the linearity and focus of the vintage, but his house style ultimately leaves a bigger mark on the fruit. "
1532,Domaine Santa Duc Les Hautes Garrigues Gigondas,2015,Rhone Red Blends,France,79,0,0.0,0,"Delightfully ripe, with a mélange of blackberry, black cherry and fig compote flavors melded together, backed by licorice root, roasted alder and bittersweet cocoa notes that add range through the finish. A hefty style, but has the detail to match. Best from 2020 through 2035. Mourvèdre steps up to one third of the blend while the balance is grenache. This has an attractive array of ripe dark cherry and blue plum fruits. The tannins are framed up with a deeper, wider shape. Try from 2020, this needs time. "
1533,Post Parade Stretch Drive Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,79,14.6,0.0,0,"The 2018s are a step up. The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Stretch Drive has rocking levels of cassis, Asian spices, tobacco leaf, and violets to go with a medium to full-bodied, elegant, seamless style on the palate. I’d be thrilled to drink bottles any time over the coming 10-15 years. "
1534,G.D. Vajra Barolo Coste di Rose,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,89,14.5,0.0,0,"With fruit from above the village of Barolo, the G.D. Vajra 2018 Barolo Coste di Rose shows a large aromatic scope and ample substance. This vineyard is characterized by very high density Diano sandstone (typical of the area), which explains the wine’s bigger sensorial impact. Its texture is velvety and smooth, and the wine offers lots of purple and red fruits with soft earth and perfumed flower. The vintage is open knit and broad in scope, perhaps lacking some of the brilliant focus you get in the cooler years. Intense and vibrant, displaying cherry, plum, earth, iron and tar flavors. The tannins are dense and assertive, yet this has energy and length, with all the components in the right place. Very clean red-berry fruit on the nose, together with citrus and cedar notes. Medium body with fine-grained tannins and a tight bead of fruit at the end. Sustainable. Plenty of hidden depth of black cherry and plum. Notes of Raspberry and strawberries with complexity and a fine balance and length. "

It’s full-bodied with solid tension and a curated finish. Extremely polished and focused. Tensioned. No malo. Made from organic grapes. Drink now. Fresh and expressive, featuring Honeycrisp apple, yuzu and lemon blossom flavors and a hint of marzipan and nutmeg, this shows wonderful restraint and focus. The long, juicy finish reveals a hint of fresh-grated ginger.  The 2020 Chardonnay Carbone is sourced from old vines in the Berry Lane vineyard in Coombsville, right next to the Carbone winery. The blocked malo style yields a Chardonnay built on brightness and energy, with lovely citrus, floral and savory accents. This is such a gorgeous wine. Best After 2021 "

1537,Benovia Sonoma County Zinfandel,2018,Zinfandel,California,52,15.2,0.0,0,"Juicy plum, black cherry and a hint of cola highlight a soft, round core in this wine. Structured and well integrated in both tannin and oak, it offers a length of baking spice and tobacco, impressing in style and powerful elegance. Intense and quite ripe, with dried cherry, licorice and pepper flavors that finish with sinewy tannins.  "
1538,Merry Edwards Klopp Ranch Pinot Noir (1.5 Liter Magnum),2017,Pinot Noir,California,149,0,0.0,0,"The 2017 Pinot Noir Klopp Ranch comes mainly from vines planted in the late 1980s in Goldridge soils, mostly Pommard clone, plus some younger vines planted to Dijon clones. It's medium ruby-purple in the glass and has a fragrant nose of warm cinnamon, mushrooms, moss-covered bark, rhubarb and red and black berries with notions of lilac and tangerine peel. It’s medium-bodied, silky and loaded with perfumed fruit layers, with a frame of chocolate-textured tannins and juicy acidity begging you to take another sip, finishing very long and very layered. Wild in pomegranate, strawberry and brambly blackberry, this longstanding vineyard-designate is deep and rich, with a density of earthiness. Thick tannins support the fruit and building elements of dried herb and lavender, allowing room for the acidity to balance its overall luxury. "

As with most of Angela’s Grenaches, it’s all varietal (from vines planted in 2000), and this release saw 46% whole clusters and spent 11 months in 36% once used oak, with the balance in tank, I believe.

As it turned out, that cool concentration stayed with the wine for days after opening, a structural component giving this the clarity and lively power of an epic Cask 23 vintage. Marcus Notaro finalized the blend at 52 percent from S.L.V. and 48 percent from Fay and aged it almost two years in new French oak barrels. The tannins are rich, the aroma smoky, but the bright liveliness of the fruit—the persimmon, the cherry and the fresh cigar tobacco—are the elements that shine through. Youthful and unevolved, this wine is an investment in the future, with patient cellaring required. This has a fresh, fruity nose of blackberries, small black cherries, mahogany, anise and crushed hazelnuts. It’s medium-to full-bodied with a creamy, silky texture. Seamlessly smooth, ripe tannins accompany velvety layers of ripe blue and black fruit. Wonderful now or in years to come. Better in 2023. Prior to the 1990 vintage, Cask 23 was a selection of the finest blocks of the SLV Vineyard. Then, with the acquisition of the neighbouring Fay Vineyard, this bottling transitioned into a blend of the finest parcels of both. This 2017 vintage (with 21 months in oak, as with both the single-vineyard bottlings) combines close to equal parts of the two sites, showing the brightness and energy of Fay with the brooding power of SLV. Aromas of coffee, clay and cedar precede a ripe but balanced palate and a long, driving finish. Drinking Window 2020 - 2045 Violet, cassis and blackberry puree notes form the bulk of this wine, while dashes of singed cedar and briar chime in throughout, with a tug of sweet earth at the very end. Still rather coiled up, so let this unwind with cellaring. Best from 2022 through 2035. "
1547,Eric et Joel Durand Cornas Empreintes,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,France,51,14.5,0.0,0,"Lush and inviting, with crushed plum and warm blackberry compote notes leading the way, along with sweet bay, anise and violet accents. Has a buried iron hint but this is fairly plush overall for a Cornas. Drink now through 2032. "
1548,Matetic Corralillo Winemaker's Blend,2018,Other Red Blends,Chile,26,14,3.8,6,"Aromas of ripe blueberry, blackberry, blackcurrant leaf, cedar and chocolate. It’s full-bodied with dusty tannins. Full and creamy in the mouth with ripe fruit and a fresh finish. Good length. Delicious. Drink now or hold. The spicy and smoky 2018 Corralillo Winemaker's Blend was produced with Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Malbec and matured in French oak barrels for 18 months. I found it unusually ripe and a little developed. It has a medium to full-bodied palate and abundant tannins. It needs powerful food. "
1549,Poet's Leap Riesling,2020,Riesling,Washington,22,12.3,0.0,0,"By Long Shadows. In many of its best incarnations, Riesling tends not to show itself fully when young. And so it is with this lovely, deep, balanced and still developing effort. Its aromas, while less than bold, do speak of depth and focus in a way that suggests early drinking, but, if you have the option, please do join us in laying some of it away for a few years while it gains richness and loses some of its tighter pieces. It is slightly sweet in a firmly balanced way that will allow it to shine as a stand-alone sipper, yet its best uses could well be alongside dishes like grilled day boat scallops or oven-baked cracked Dungeness crab seasoned with orange, ginger and soy. Such a pretty wine, with a plush yet crisp texture and floral apricot, melon and spiced nut accents that glide on the sleek finish. Drink now. "
1550,Chateau Puygueraud,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,19,14.5,4.2,15,"An array of fresh dark and blue-fruit aromas, together with hints of baking spices, chocolate and crushed rocks. Full-bodied and compact with firm, polished tannins and delicious, succulent fruit. Refined and firm on the finish. 86% merlot and 14% cabernet franc. Drinkable now, but better in 2025. The 2019 Château Puygueraud is also terrific, with ripe darker cherry, plum, leafy tobacco and hints of chocolate on the nose. This medium-bodied, rounded, supple, elegant beauty has soft tannins, wonderful balance, and a great finish. Drink it over the coming decade. Best After 2022	 "
1551,Chateau Sansonnet,2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,36,14.5,3.8,46,"Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, the 2017 Sansonnet needs some coaxing to reveal notions of warm blueberries, plum preserves and boysenberries followed by Chinese five spice, licorice, fertile loam and charcuterie with a waft of lavender. Full-bodied, the palate is packed with layered black and blue fruits, framed by ripe, velvety tannins and plenty of freshness, finishing long and with great purity. A tight, compact red with lots of chewy tannins, yet they are polished and poised. Full body. Savory with blue fruit at the end. A blend of 85% merlot, 8% cabernet franc and 7% cabernet sauvignon. Needs time to come together. Better after 2022. This is enticing, with a succulent core of crushed plum, blackberry and dark currant fruit that melds nicely with apple wood and sweet tobacco notes. Shows a good brambly tug through the grippy finish. Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Best from 2021 through 2032. Knitted down, with a creep of limestone and scraping minerality that peels the layers back slowly. This suggests confidence and is going to age well. Not exactly seductive today, but there is bitter black chocolate on display, precise cassis, plenty of tannins and a fresh backbone. Drinking Window 2025 - 2042. Powerful tannins dominate this massive wine that has as much to do with structure as with dark black-fruit flavors. Dense and concentrated, it will age well and should be drunk from 2023. "
1552,Langlois Chateau Cremant de Loire,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,24,12.5,3.9,47,"A blend of Chenin Blanc, Cabernet Franc and Chardonnay, this is a round, mouthfilling sparkling wine with ripe flavors layered with grapefruit acidity and a tight, final texture that is crisp and mineral "
1553,Domaine Matrot Maranges la Fussiere Premier Cru,2018,Pinot Noir,France,42,0,4.5,5,"The 2018 Maranges 1er Cru La Fussière wafts from the glass with aromas of cherries, raspberries and candied peel, followed by a medium to full-bodied, velvety palate with good depth at the core and refined tannins that assert themselves on the back end. "
1554,Laurel Glen Counterpoint Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,54,14.5,0.0,0,"Crisply focused in currant, dried herb and cedar, this is a classically structured red that is vibrantly approachable and ample to drink in its youth. With just 30% new French oak, it delivers forested earthiness and high-toned freshness that complement each other well for a very fair price. Offers a tasty mix of gently mulled blackberry and red currant fruit flavors, laced with subtle herb and iron accents along the way. Judicious toast lets everything knit, keeping a fresh edge through the finish. The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Counterpoint is a classic, elegant, medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon with plenty of spicy red and black currant fruits, notes of tobacco, cedarwood, and earth, ripe, moderate tannins, and a fresh, elegant style that will evolve nicely for 10-15 years. A gentle vintage of Counterpoint, this estate selection has the warm-cool balance of Sonoma Mountain cabernet. It’s foresty with scents of bay and wild blueberry sweetness. Then the tannins come up to subdue that fruit for now. Give it a year in the cellar, then decant it for lamb chops. "
1555,Stags' Leap Winery Viognier,2019,Viognier,California,33,14.1,4.2,37,"Honeycomb and slate greet the nose first in this dry, crisp and lengthy white wine, moderate in viscosity and ripeness. Lovely notes of apricot follow around a tease of honeysuckle and white flower. It’s impressive through the focused finish. "
1556,Le Ragnaie Casanovina Montosoli Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,159,0,0.0,0,"This is one of three black-label special selections made by Le Ragnaie. The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Casanovina Montosoli has a tonic and bright character with dark fruit flavors, blackcurrant and tarry smoke. The wine feels tightly knit and compact, but it takes on more volume and momentum, especially as it hits the palate. In fact, it ends on a long and polished note with some crushed limestone or dusty mineral. Located directly beside the cellar of the historic Baricci estate, Le Ragnaie’s Montosoli holding is a 1ha, east-facing plot at 300 metres above sea level. It impresses immediately, exhibiting enormous depth on the nose. Plums, violets and earthy truffle notes are backlit by bright cherry. The palate brings in nuances of orange and tar, while linear tannins are tightly wound and sandy in texture. The fruit is plentiful without being heavy, overripe or obvious. Finishing long and savoury this is one of the wines of the vintage. This red combines cherry, raspberry, earth, stone and sanguine aromas and flavors. Almost racy, with vivid acidity and dense, fine-grained tannins providing structure. This turns compact on the finish, yet should open up nicely in 2-3 years. "
1557,Chanson Pere & Fils Beaune Clos des Feves Premier Cru Monopole,2019,Pinot Noir,France,129,13.5,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Domaine Chanson Beane Clos des Fèves Monopole Premier Cru is attractive, nicely-structure, and delicious. TASTING NOTES: This wine shows up with vibrant black fruit and chalk and earth notes in its aroma and flavors. Enjoy it with grilled lamb. (Tasted: February 24, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Though concentrated, with cherry, currant and boysenberry flavors, this red is also sleek and vibrant, with bright acidity and refined tannins, showing excellent balance and length. Sandalwood and earth notes add detail. Best from 2023 through 2035. "
1558,Chateau de Nalys Saintes Pierres de Nalys Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2017,Rhone Red Blends,France,57,15,3.8,8,"Coming from tiny yields (the estate was down 40% in 2017), the 2017 Châteauneuf Du Pape Saintes Pierres De Nalys offers a ripe, medium to full-bodied, balanced style as well as lots of classic dark berry fruits, licorice, garrigue, and peppery goodness. Balanced, with a great core of fruit, it’s a softer, more forward, charming wine than the grand vin and is ideal for drinking over the coming decade. Glistening ruby. Spice-accented dark berries and cherry on the nose, along with suggestions of garrigue and smoky minerals. Juicy blackberry, cherry cola and lavender flavors provide very good palate coverage and turn spicier with air. The floral note carries through a clinging, energetic finish shaped by smooth, well-knit tannins.  A grassy and fresh white with roughly 50% clairette, this has lemons and some lightly grassy nuances with a smooth palate that has melon-pastry flavors and smooth texture. Marked by hints of allspice and clove, the 2017 Chateauneuf du Pape Saintes Pierres delivers classic leather and cherry flavors. It's medium to full-bodied, yet silky and streamlined, well-balanced for its stated 15% alcohol. Drink it over the next 5–8 years. A traditional style, with a slightly dried edge to the mix of cherry, damson plum and red currant fruit, with a dusting of sandalwood and rooibos tea notes on the finish. Grenache and Syrah. "
1559,ZD Wines Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,57,0,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 ZD Pinot Noir offers a lovely look into the elegance of PNs from the Carneros AVA. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits pleasing and bright aromas and flavors of black fruit and earth. Enjoy it with grilled lamb chops with plenty of garden greens. (Tasted: March 3, 2021, San Francisco, CA) "
1560,Jean-Marc Burgaud Beaujolais-Villages Vignes de Lantignie,2021,Gamay,France,18,0,0.0,0,"Now labeled as the 2021 Beaujolais-Lantignié rather than as Beaujolais-Villages, with a view to further foreground its Lantignié origins, this cuvée is once again a notable success. Offering up aromas of smoky berries, spices and petals, it's medium-bodied, supple and seamless, with lively acids and a charming, giving profile. "
1561,Musso Roero Arneis,2020,Arneis,Italy,26,13,4.4,8,"A nice white for a little ceviche on the terrace, the Musso 2020 Roero Arneis shines bright from the glass and puts you in a good mood for the summer months to come. The wine is cheerfully redolent of Amalfi lemon, summer peach and exotic papaya. The Arneis grape always shows a slightly waxy or fatty impression in the mouth, and you sense that here, although this expression remains crisp and lean-bodied overall. Loads of fresh flowers on the nose to accompany the table-grape fruit character. Turns a bit more minerally on the palate, but the fruit remains clean and fresh. Dainty Arneis. "
1562,Salt of the Earth Flore de Moscato,2021,Muscat,California,11,7.5,0.0,0,
1563,Chateau Canon,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,169,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2019 Château Canon is another brilliant wine from this talented team that delivers everything you could want from this incredible terroir located on the upper limestone plateau. Based on 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc, it has a pure, incredibly refined, yet still powerful profile that takes time to unwind. Offering up beautiful notes of black raspberries, wild strawberries, spring flowers, chalky minerality, and graphite, it hits the palate with medium to full-bodied richness, a layered, multi-dimensional mouthfeel, ultra-fine tannins, and a finish that's something to behold. This isn't the massive style of the 2015 and reminds me slightly of the 2016. It's perfectly balanced and, again, the purity and finesse are off the charts. It needs to be forgotten for 4-5 years and enjoyed over the following 2-3 decades. Hats off to Nicolas Audebert for another sensational wine. Best after 2026. The 2019 Canon is creamy and layered. A wine of immense charm and sensuality, the 2019 is immediately appealing today, but also clearly has the potential to age for many decades. The 2019 is not as exuberant as most recent vintages, and yet its balance is simply magnificent. Readers can expect an aristocratic Saint-Emilion that is holding so much in reserve. Patience is key. Tasted three times. Blackberries, blueberries and dark chocolate with bark, mushrooms and chalk. Lavender, too. Full-bodied with firm tannins that are polished and velvety. White pepper, gesso and crushed stone. It’s full-bodied and layered with tightness and focus and a long finish. It’s solid and stalwart, as usual. Reminds me of the very special 1955. One for the cellar. Give this until 2026 to see what it really has. The 2019 Canon has turned out brilliantly in bottle, wafting from the glass with complex aromas of raspberries and red plums mingled with notions of raw cocoa, dark chocolate, pencil shavings and rose petals. Medium to full-bodied, seamless and multidimensional, it's one of the most refined, elegant right bank wines of the vintage, with a deep core of fruit, beautifully refined tannins, lively acids and a long, perfumed finish. This is a superb achievement for Nicolas Audebert and his team. Violet, cassis, plum purée and blackberry reduction notes are layered together without being compacted, giving each space to breath and unfurl while letting the fine lacy thread of chalky minerality to flow in between. This shows the heat and slight grain of this distinctive vintage, but manages those aspects better than most. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best After 2025. "
1564,Bodegas Campillo Gran Reserva,2009,Tempranillo,Spain,52,0,3.9,5,"From Grupo Faustino, this single-vineyard red (90% Tempranillo and 10% Graciano) aged 30 months in French oak, whose presence is apparent on the nose alongside toffee, wild cherry, and cedar. It’s a bright, elegant, and white-peppered beauty with balanced acidity.  A strong vintage with medium body. Dark, earthy plums and red cherries, spices and hints of earth and leather here. Good balance and persistence. Drink now and for the next decade. Elegant. Marked with creamy vanilla new oak, this is a rich and polished wine that is a touch confected. It is full-bodied with notes of roast nuts and smoke; an exuberant style that people will love. Drinking Window 2018 - 2023 With a developed nose of forest floor, cigar box, sweet spices and cured meat, the 2009 Gran Reserva is the most classical within the Campillo range. It has plenty of tannins and feels a bit developed, like the fruit is now receding and the tannic structure might remain. I'd drink it sooner rather than later. 30,000 bottles produced. It's been in bottle since the summer of 2013, after 30 months in new barriques. "
1565,Azienda Agricola La Torre Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,79,0,0.0,0,"The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is silky, smooth and very expressive. The whole theme of the 2017 vintage sees a tug-of-war between power and elegance. In many cases, power wins in 2017 and elegance is sidelined. Not here. Made with organic fruit, this is a delicate and graceful expression of Sangiovese with bright red fruit, cassis, lilac, earth and lavender essence. With fruit from a cool 420 meters in elevation, this is one of the standout bottles of the vintage. "
1566,Chateau Palmer,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,384,14,4.4,18,"I am breathless with the dark-berry, lavender and burnt-orange aromas. Some salt. Just so formidable and deep. Stunningly sexy on the palate with a density and power, yet it leaves things so clean and bright. You want to drink it and enjoy it now, but it has the structure to last forever. Drink in 2022. Bottled relatively late in mid-September 2017, the 2015 Palmer is a blend of 44% Merlot and 50% Cabernet Sauvignon with a small portion of Petit Verdot. Medium to deep garnet-purple colored, it offers vibrant red currants, black cherries, wild blueberries, earth and mineral characteristics to begin, with slowly unfurling floral notes of violets and dried roses plus compelling baker’s chocolate and fragrant earth layers. Medium to full-bodied, generously fruited and possessing firm yet very, very fine-grained, mind-blowingly ripe tannins, the multifaceted palate features something of a skip in its step in terms of freshness, while it goes beguilingly earthy on the finish with some mineral hints. Very classy, elegant and sophisticated, this vintage is downright regal in its juxtaposition between poise and audaciousness. Think 2005 Palmer with a tick more fruit intensity, perfume and passion. One of the gems in Margaux is unquestionably the 2015 Palmer. Possessing more elegance and purity, as well as concentration, than the Alter Ego, it offers up a gorgeous bouquet of crème de cassis, caramelized cherries, charcoal, and graphite, with just a hint of spring flowers in the background. A final blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 44% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot that was brought up in 70% new oak, this full-bodied, ripe, incredibly polished 2015 is already hard to resist given its elegance and purity, yet should be at its best from 2023-2043. If you have more than one bottle, it's sensational today as well. This is dark and muscular in style, brimming with bramble, warm tar and paving stone notes that are matched by the deep layers of fig, blackberry and cassis fruit. A gorgeous bittersweet chocolate detail adds spine to the finish while violet and iron elements lurk in reserve. Another large wave of fruit and dark earth courses through the finish. Best from 2025 through 2045. It's very interesting to watch a 'super-second' risk scaling back the muscular attributes of its wine. The key, says director Thomas Duroux, was building the blend carefully and using the press wines to preserve the mid-palate (12% press in this wine, around the same as the 2015). It's less powerful and concentrated than the last few vintages, and yet the wine feels sculpted and sewn into place. The fine tannins are extremely clear and precise, and there's a purity of fruit expression that gives an overwhelming initial impression. The aromatics are really striking, offering an abundance of violet notes on the nose with huge finesse. It just gets better and better in the mouth,, and the tannins do that slow-build thing that is so disarming. This has clear ageing potential. Very low SO2 use for the past few years, in keeping with their biodynamic principles. Just one plot of Petit Verdot for the grand vin was hit by frost. Harvested 20-29 September. 11,000 cases of Palmer, representing 55% of the crop. "
1567,Chateau Grand-Puy-Ducasse (Futures Pre-Sale),2020,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,37,0,0.0,0,"Flows wonderfully from the start, with an already accessible feel to the mix of cassis and dark blackberry notes inlaid with singed alder, warm paving stone, tobacco leaf and graphite accents that then carry the finish. In the end, there's no rush at all here. A pretty gorgeous Pauillac. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. "
1568,Chateau Cos d'Estournel (Futures Pre-Sale),2020,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,224,0,0.0,0,"A broad, rich, enticing wine, built on a core of exotic mulberry and loganberry notes laced with black tea, spices and incense. Rounded through the finish, with the fruit cruising through under a suave gloss of toast. A real crowd-pleaser, with a luxurious feel that makes this hard to lay off of now. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Drink now. "
1569,Hitching Post Cork Dancer Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,28,14.1,0.0,0,"The 2019 Pinot Noir Cork Dancer is a juicy, exuberant wine that will drink well right out of the gate. Succulent red cherry, spice, rose petal and orange zest are all dialed up. The 2019 is fresh and vibrant, yet packs plenty of punch. It’s a delicious wine to enjoy over the next handful of years. "
1570,Chateau Haut-Bailly (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,234,14.5,0.0,0,"Extremely aromatic, with incredible wet-earth, bark, stone and graphite notes on the nose, then changing to violets, blackberries and blackcurrants. Full-bodied, yet so linear and fine, with titanium tannins that go on so long. Builds and builds then just rolls around the palate through the endless finish. Real Bordeaux here. 56% cabernet sauvignon, 36% merlot, 4% cabernet franc, and 4% petit verdot. Exceptional. Best after 2029. COMMENTARY: Chateau Haut-Bailey is my go-to Pessac-Leognan. Always an admirable wine, the 2019 vintage stands as one of the winery's most exemplary efforts. TASTING NOTES: This wine explodes with aromas and flavors of blackcurrants, berries, and hints of oak. Enjoy it with a well-seasoned roast leg of lamb. (Tasted: June 29, 2022, San Francisco, CA) A beautiful, elegant, and quintessential expression of this terroir, the deep ruby/purple-hued 2019 Château Haut-Bailly offers up a tight yet promising bouquet of ripe blackcurrants, darker cherries, iron, tobacco leaf, scorched earth, and cedar pencil. Possessing incredible minerality, medium to full body, ripe tannins, and a classy, aristocratic, regal style, it opens up nicely with air and will benefit from 5-7 years of bottle age and have a lengthy prime drinking plateau of 20-30 years. It's another pure class release from this great estate, which is run by the talented Véronique Sanders. Best after 2027. "
1571,Chateau Pitray,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,16,14.5,3.8,173,"Aromas of glossy, spicy oak and plush, ripe dark plums with hazelnut and tarry nuances, too. The flavorful palate delivers in assertive and bold style with a juicy and intense surge of fruit, holding long into the finish.  "
1572,Altocedro Ano Cero Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,17,14.6,3.9,11,"This is a restrained yet fresh and elegant red with aromas of black fruit and cedar wood and some green nuances. Full-bodied with chewy tannins and a long, warming finish. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Altocedro Año Cero Cabernet Sauvignon offers excellent ripeness and richness on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine shows up with lovely ripe red and black fruit as well as lasting licorice notes in its flavors and finish. Pair it with grilled short ribs.

1573,SuNu Shea East Hill Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,Oregon,79,13.2,0.0,0,"This has sophisticated earthy aromas with dried flowers and red cherries. Some autumnal, leafy notes on offer, too. The palate has impressive, succulent tannins that are super fine but densely layered. The drive is effortless, as good pinot should be. Red fruit abounds. Great pinot. The 2017 Pinot Noir Shea Vineyard East Hill offers a similar savory character yet has beautiful purity and precision, with spicy, earthy, nutty aromas and flavors. With good acidity, a great mid-palate, and outstanding balance, it needs 2-3 years of bottle age, but your patience will be rewarded. Medium ruby, the 2017 Pinot Noir Shea East Hill Heritage Clones features crushed black cherries and black currants with nuances of dust, earth, pipe tobacco, cracked pepper and potpourri. Medium-bodied and silky, it offers a classy layering of fruit, spice and earth with great freshness and a long finish. This is a lovely example of a leaner, more ethereal style this vintage. "

1587,Marciano Estate Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,299,14.8,0.0,0,"Just bottled in June of this year, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon is more up-front and sexy compared to the more focused, elegant 2018, yet it has a similar level of purity and class. Lots of cassis fruits, spicy oak, lead pencil, and subtle floral and spicy notes define the bouquet, and it hits the palate with full-bodied richness, a deep, layered mouthfeel, velvety tannins, and one heck of a great finish. This is another remarkable St. Helena Cabernet that's already hard to resist yet has the balance, purity, and structure to evolve for 20-30 years. "
1588,Badia a Coltibuono Vin Santo Occhio di Pernice (375ML half-bottle),2007,Other Dessert,Italy,79,15,0.0,0,"Driven by honey and molasses, the Badia a Coltibuono 2007 Vin Santo del Chianti Classico Occhio di Pernice is a pure beauty. Made with organic fruit, this dessert wine opens to a dark copper color and beautifully intense aromas of dried fruit, fig, honey, brown sugar and maple syrup. There is a vein of heat and warmth there that underlines the sweetness and the ripeness of the fruit. "
1589,Melville Donna's Syrah,2020,Syrah/Shiraz,California,64,14.2,0.0,0,"The 2020 Syrah Donna's Block comes from vines planted in pure sand and was vinified using 100% whole clusters. Medium ruby-purple, it has loads of personality! Wild blackberry aromas are streaked with nuances of iron, peppercorn and dried herbs. The medium-bodied palate offers intense, herbal fruits supported by chalky tannins and refreshing acidity, and it boasts a long, layered finish replete with floral perfume. I love this combination of earthy wildness and pretty floral fruit. Best After 2022. "
1590,Martin Ray Santa Cruz Mountains Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,37,14.4,0.0,0,"Blackberries, blackcurrants, gravel, dried rosemary and cigar box on the nose.

1591,Donnhoff Nahe Estate Riesling Trocken,2021,Riesling,Germany,26,11.5,0.0,0,"Brimming with stone fruit, this juicy dry riesling is hard not to like. Very lively and light-footed, also thanks to the moderate alcohol (11.5%), the mineral acidity and the spritz of natural carbon dioxide, which really lift the very clean finish. From organically grown grapes with Fair'n Green certification. Drink now. "
1592,Echeverria No Es Pituko Natural Wine Cabernet Franc,2021,Cabernet Franc,Chile,16,14,4.3,9,"Crushed stones, violets and dark berries. This is succulent and bright on the palate with solid, firm tannins. A tight, authentic and fruit-expressive cabernet franc. No sulfites added. Drink now "
1593,Domaine de Montille Volnay Les Mitans Premier Cru,2019,Pinot Noir,France,199,12.5,0.0,0,"This 0.72ha vineyard is located in sandy limestone soils near the northern edge of the village. Fermented, as is the custom, exclusively with whole clusters, to give a wine with dark mulberry fruit and an edge of wild herbs. The feel on the palate is tannic, structured and long; this will surely open well with a bit of time. "
1594,Margerum D Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,California,49,12.5,0.0,0,"The 2021 Sauvignon Blanc D brings more complexity as well as richness.

Its juicy fruit flavors take on notes of white smoke and minerals as the wine opens in the glass, leaving an impression of the volcanic origins of the Irpinian soils. A terrific value, the Feudi di San Gregorio 2021 Fiano di Avellino (with 300,000 bottles on the market) is expressive and radiant with honeysuckle, white jasmine, freshly squeezed lemon, white peach and wet river stone. That mineral signature adds a lot to this lean-bodied white. Lemons, white pears, white lavender and cream. Medium-bodied with a sleek texture and fresh acidity. Pretty white fruit and flowers.

1601,Antica Townsend Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2012,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,109,0,4.0,5,"Rich and refined, with a suppleness and grace that lets the mix of loamy earth, cedar, dried berry and tobacco leaf stand out. Best from 2015 through 2027. The 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon Townsend is a classic Napa offering with impressive ripeness buttressed by a European tannic structure. This dark ruby/purple-colored wine is still young, and less flattering than many 2012s. However, do not mistake that for a lack of quality or potential as this Cabernet offers up plenty of cassis, loamy soil, tobacco leaf and spice characteristics. Medium-bodied and concentrated, it plays it close to the vest so requires several more years of bottle age. It should keep for 12-15 years. "
1602,Tenuta di Ceppaiano Keith Haring Toscana,2016,Tuscan Blends,Italy,24,13.5,4.3,99,"Very fresh and clean with blackberries and hints of vanilla and chocolate. Medium to full body, integrated and polished tannins and flavorful finish. Refined. A year or two will really make this right. Try after 2022. COMMENTARY: The 2016 Tenuta di Ceppaiano Keith Haring is stylish, bright, and pleasing in the finish. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of rustic earth and black fruits.

1603,Terra Costantino de Aetna Etna Bianco,2019,Carricante,Italy,31,13.5,3.8,6,"This shows how powerful the dry whites from the carricante grape can get, while still retaining freshness and mineral bite. Very focused with tons of candied citrus, angelica and pine nuts at the long, driving finish. From organically grown grapes. Drink or hold. Made with an organic blend of 80% Carricante, 15% Catarratto and 5% Minnella, the Terra Costantino 2019 Etna Bianco de Aetna shows a lot of richness and fruit concentration. That extra density is a characteristic of this vintage and is probably more evident at the lower elevations of Etna, or at 450 to 550 meters above sea level where the estate's 10-hectare vineyard is positioned. These conditions are especially suited to this wine that boasts plenty of orchard fruit and tropical intensity, with a smooth, mid-weight palate. Production is 15,000 bottles. "

1606,Domaine Gros Frere et Soeur Clos Vougeot Grand Cru,2019,Pinot Noir,France,247,0,0.0,0,"A slightly cooler and higher-toned if less spicy nose reflects notes of various red berries, especially cherry, along with plenty of earth is again trimmed in enough wood to notice. There is fine volume to the round, fleshy and suave medium weight flavors that exhibit good power on the lingering finish that also displays hints of warmth and bitter cherry pit character. This broad-shouldered effort is going to require at least moderate patience. "
1607,Parador Hossfield Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2012,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,90,14.5,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2012 Parador Hossfeld Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon plays up bigtime with excellent focus and richness.

1608,Domaine Belargus Ronceray Blanc,2018,Chenin Blanc,France,59,13.5,0.0,0,"The 2018 Anjou Ronceray assembles all the plots of the Domaine on the Quarts-de-Chaume rump. Its name refers to the abbey of the same name, owner of the Chaume vineyards since the 11th century, reports Ivan Massonat, who stresses the complex geology of the terroir that combines schists and pudding sandstone. The bouquet of the golden-yellow 2018 is noble, perfectly ripe and concentrated in its elegant stone fruit aromas that intermingle with precise and refreshing slate as well as lemony notes. Filigreed, finessed and perfectly round and intense on the palate, this is a gorgeous Chenin with intense fruit, lush fruit concentration, lots of extract, fine tannins but also finesse and balance. Grapefruit bitters on the finish. To me, this is a picture-book Anjou from Rochefort-sur-Loire, and it is characterized by richness, finesse and elegance. Irresistible. COMMENTARY: The 2018 Domaine Belargus Ronceray is unique and delicious white wine. TASTING NOTES: This wine shows the aromas of hard candy, savory spices, and earth. Enjoy it with mixed seafood in a light and clear broth. (Tasted: June 20, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Ronceray is the most important cuvée of the estate and extends over more than 4ha on clay, schist, sandstone and pudding-stone soils. Pear, spices, flowers, menthol, a mouthfeel of roundness but with remarkable vibrancy on the mid-palate and then a light-footed finish. A fresh, complex Anjou white that has rectitude and precision. This seems subtle at first, with notes of candied ginger and persimmon, but the fruit and spice elements keep unravelling one after another, all backed by finely beaded acidity that lends definition and stretches out the long, fresh finish. Try now with food or cellar for a few more years. Best from 2022 through 2031. "
1609,Ridge Monte Bello,2006,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,339,13.5,0.0,0,"While it is eclipsed by the brilliance of the 2005, the 2006 Monte Bello (68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot, and 2% Cabernet Franc) is a very strong effort. Its dense purple color is followed by copious aromas of creme de cassis, licorice, spice box, and a touch of oak. Well-balanced, dense, pure, layered, and rich, its big, rich style is similar to the 2003. This cuvee should keep for 25-30 years in a cool cellar.  The 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon Monte Bello comes from a warmer, generous year and is 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Petite Verdot, and the balance Cabernet Franc. It’s still youthfully colored and has classic Cabernet notes of crème de cassis, lead pencil, and vanilla oak. This medium to full-bodied effort is just now at the early stages of maturity and is silky, graceful, and elegant on the palate, with its still-present structure beautifully integrated into the wine. You can safely crack bottles any time over the coming two decades. Relatively open compared to the 2007 with sweet tobacco and plums and berries. Full body, velvety and gorgeous, with dried fruits, almost peaches, dark fruits. I love the finish. Why wait on this? But will improve with age wonderfully. Toasty oak shows more too. But it's so pretty. On the quiet side of intense, this vintage of Monte Bello is austere, delivering its fruit like a cool rain of berries. As a young cabernet, the flavors of black plum, dried currants and cranberries are held tight in the grip of oak. There's also a floral scent of roses before the tannins shut it down. This should plump up with a few years in the cellar, building on its elegance to match roast leg of lamb. "
1610,Dr. Loosen Wehlener Sonnenuhr Alte Reben Riesling Grosses Gewachs Reserve,2015,Riesling,Germany,89,12.5,0.0,0,"Super elegant and refined with great herbal delicacy, this is as graceful as dry Mosel riesling gets. Buy it also has deep slate foundations that give it imposing presence. I love the laserbeam, straight finish that shoots out in the direction of infinity. Drink or hold. "
1611,Pio Cesare Barbaresco,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,79,14,0.0,0,"Strawberries with hints of walnuts, asphalt and bark. Dried flowers, too. Full-bodied with fine, racy tannins and a very long, pretty finish. Refined tannins. Shows excellent length for the vintage. "
1612,Quinta do Noval Noval Black,Reserve,Port,Portugal,22,19.5,4.2,98,"Christian Seely recently introduced this wine in New York as a rethinking of the super-premium, multivintage Porto style. Black replaces LB, Noval's former entry in this range, and uses top-quality fruit to create a soft, accommodating texture. The aromas are purple-black while the flavors are pure black cherry. Acidity spices it up and adds to the juiciness of the finish. It's plump in the middle and supple all the way through, ending on fruit-skin tannin and a touch of chocolate from oak. At the level of many of the region's best LBVs, this wine may become a staple for a new generation of Port drinkers. 'Black' is a new blend produced from classic varieties that do not make it into the Quinta do Noval vintage. There are ripe blackberries, tar, smoke and orange liqueur on the nose that takes time to open. The palate is medium-bodied, very sleek on the entry, fleshy black fruits, sloe, spice and just a hint of white pepper, leading to a very focused finish. "
1613,Zuccardi Serie A Malbec,2020,Malbec,Argentina,15,14.5,4.0,14,"Perfumed and inviting with a nose of herb, black pepper and violet petal, palate of vibrant acidity, plum and textural tannins. "
1614,Domaine de la Janasse Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,79,0,0.0,0,"The classic 2020 Châteauneuf Du Pape from this team is a winner, offering a medium to full-bodied, finesse-driven style as well as terrific aromatics of darker berries, raspberries, garrigue, and flowers, with a kiss of background peppery spice. It's balanced, medium to full-bodied, has ripe, soft tannins, and is loaded with character. Drink bottles over the coming 10-15 years. Best after 2022. "
1615,Inama Carmenere Piu,2019,Carmenere,Italy,24,13.5,3.4,7,"Very focused and tangy nose with lots of white pepper and peppercorn that jump out first, followed by dried herbs, bark and red berries. Really elegant on the medium-bodied palate, with fine, silky tannins. Very different from Chilean counterparts, more akin to a fine Chinese cabernet gernischt, which is carmenere. Delicious now, but will hold, too. "
1616,El Enemigo Bonarda,2018,Bonarda,Argentina,28,13.5,4.1,21,"Big, rich and well-spiced, with structured dark fruit flavors that feature dried savory spice accents. Underbrush notes line the minerally finish. A medium-to full-bodied red with aromas of blackcurrants, stewed blackberries, licorice and ash. Firm, creamy tannins and a plush, velvety texture. Very typical for a bonarda. "
1617,No.1 Family Estate,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,Zealand,38,12.5,0.0,0,"The pale, coppery NV No 1 Rose is 100% Pinot Noir. It's slightly richer and tastes riper than the other NV bottlings and differs considerably in flavor as well, with hints of wild, alpine strawberries, lime and a subtle toasty element. It's medium-bodied, with a fine, almost creamy mouthfeel and a tart, refreshing finish. "
1618,Catena Alta Malbec (1.5 Liter Magnum),2016,Malbec,Argentina,95,13.5,0.0,0,"I also had the chance to taste the 2016 Catena Alta Malbec, when they used a higher percentage of grapes from Nicasia. In this vintage, it's truly 100% Malbec that fermented in tank with full clusters and finished fermenting after pressing, without skins. It's serious and elegant, with the year's signature freshness. 2016 has really marked the wines with great freshness. This is serious and with zero sweetness, complete and direct.  Made from 100% Malbec from a number of vineyards (Angélica, La Pirámide, Nicasia and Adrianna) fermented and aged in 70% new barrels, the 2016 Malbec Historic Rows is an incredibly elegant, seamless wine that has an almost Burgundian style in its mulberry, blueberries, incense, forest floor, and spring flower-laced aromas and flavors. Beautiful on the palate as well, with medium to full body, supple tannins, and terrific balance, this is one of those wines that grows on you with time in the glass and shines on all accounts. Drink it any time over the coming decade or more. Plenty of cocoa powder as well as violets follow through to some serious tannins that are already well integrated. They and the crisp acidity give the dry finish some assertive power. "
1619,Murgo Etna Rosso,2020,Nerello Mascalese,Italy,18,0,0.0,0,"A woodsy mix of wild berries, savory herbs and hints of clove form a deeply alluring bouquet as the 2020 Etna Rosso opens in the glass. Its soft and enveloping textures soothes, as red and hints of blue fruit wash across the palate with ease. This leaves a gentle tug of tannin to linger, as nuances of blueberry skins slowly taper off. The 2020 is wonderfully balanced and geared for immediate appeal. A hint of tar and smoke lend depth to this wine’s bright cherry and plum flavors. It finishes on a savory note, ready for roast pork. Fragrant with floral, graphite and spice notes, this bright and juicy, light- to medium-bodied red features macerated cherry and strawberry fruit, mineral and wild herb flavors tightly meshed to crunchy tannins. "
1620,Champagne Eric Rodez Brut Grand Cru Cuvee des Grands,Vintages,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,119,11.14,0.0,0,"Behind the somewhat eccentric multilingual name and a paterfamilias (Eric) who always wears the most eccentric glasses, we have one of the great multi-vintage cuvées, with all but 25% of the blend coming from reserve wine. Dosed low at 2.5g/L, the wine is unerringly complex, boasting bright red fruit with a savoury undertow, then clear citric acidity adding linearity and a rich biscuity core, courtesy the maturity of the components, all of which are now harmoniously integrated. Disgorged in April 2020 with three grams per liter dosage, the latest rendition of the NV Brut Cuvée des Grand Vintages wafts from the glass with inviting aromas of pear, toasted almonds, dried white flowers, honeycomb, peach and nougat. Full-bodied, elegantly fleshy and enveloping, with ripe but racy acids, a pillowy mousse and a nicely layered core, it's already quite expressive despite its recent disgorgement, but I suspect it will show even more depth and dimension with another year or two on cork. "
1621,Louis Latour Pommard Epenots Premier Cru,2019,Pinot Noir,France,149,14.5,4.9,22,"The dark-cherry and wet-earth nose with touches of dried lemon peel and dried herbs is really fascinating. Then comes the compact palate with none of the rusticity associated with this appellation. Long, bold finish that’s very expressive. Drinkable now, but best from 2022. "

1623,Roots Run Deep The Graduate Cabernet Sauvignon,2016,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,150,15.5,0.0,0,"In 2017, Macario Montoya joined Mark Albrecht’s team at Roots Run Deep as winemaker, responsible for blending four different “Higher Education” cabernets. Each originates at a different block in the vineyard, which ranges in elevation from 1,700 to 2,000 feet; each is fermented with a different strain of yeasts and aged in different cooperage. This one spends its time in Seguin Moreau barrels, and the blend includes five percent each of malbec and merlot from Pritchard Hill; those factors tame the dynamic power of its mountain-grown tannins, yielding a trumpet blare of volcanic-soil intensity. Having tasted all four, this one struck our panelists as the most vibrant, layering red, yellow and orange-toned fruit in sunset colors, lasting on herbs, smoke and depths of earthy savor. It’s a complex wine, with all of its details aligned. Spiced plum, cedar and tobacco highlight a generously full-bodied, concentrated wine that’s deeply etched in tannin and oak. It was blended with 5% Merlot and 5% Malbec.  "
1624,Tornatore Trimarchisa Etna Rosso,2017,Nerello Mascalese,Italy,84,15,0.0,0,"A tight, tannic Etna red with red fruit, smoked oak and walnut. It’s full and structured and really needs time to mellow and come together. Wood showing now, but will come around nicely with bottle age. The estate wine showing the most medium or long-term potential, the Tornatore 2017 Etna Rosso Trimarchisa is Nerello Mascalese with a tiny touch of Nerello Cappuccio. Compared to the classic Etna Rosso from this same estate, this wine is richer and more fleshed out with wild berry, cassis and flinty notes of pencil shavings or campfire ash. The wine is well balanced and it shows some dark hot-vintage intensity on all sides with dark ripeness, medium textural richness and good length. Some 18 months of oak aging has also added volume to this expression from Contrada Trimarchisa.  Made with 95% Nerello Mascalese and 5% Nerello Cappuccio, this has aromas of underbrush, ripe berries, new leather and eucalyptus. The brawny palate offers blackberry jam, dried Morello cherry and star anise alongside assertive, close-grained tannins and the heat of evident alcohol. It closes on a saline note. "
1625,Sterling Napa Merlot,2016,Merlot,California,30,14.7,4.0,59,"Plush and well-spiced, with sinewy power to the dried red currant, plum and raspberry flavors. Notes of slate and hot stone show on the chiseled finish. Drink now through 2022. "

1627,H. Billiot Fils Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,France,64,12.5,0.0,0,"This is an exuberant rosé of pinot noir (including 20 percent chardonnay and 10 percent of the pinot vinified as a red wine). The pale copper-pink wine ferments in stainless steel and gains its substantial richness from Ambonnay fruit. The brisk chalk tension takes the red-currant flavors in a refreshing direction, a vinous Champagne with the kind of lush richness that would be delicious with ripe Camembert or other bloomy-rind cheese. The NV Brut Rose Grand Cru blossoms beautifully in the glass with layers of fruit that fill out in the glass. As always, Billiot’s Rose is a rich, broad-shouldered wine with plenty of intensity and vinous depth. Well-knit, with fresh acidity and a subtle tang of salinity married to flavors of wild strawberry, nectarine, chalk and pickled ginger set on a lacy mousse. The NV Champagne Brut Rosé is 80% Pinot Noir (10% vin rouge from 2016) and the remainder Chardonnay. It is lifted with a perfume of strawberries and cream, peach rings, and fresh flowers, and the palate is medium-bodied and refreshing, with an energetic mousse and a clean, modest finish. More tangerine citrus and a bit of salinity appear on the finish. This is a lovely entry rosé to drink over the next 10 years. Best after 2022. "
1628,Flying Goat Cellars Rio Vista Vineyard Dijon Clone Pinot Noir,2014,Pinot Noir,California,47,14.7,0.0,0,"Rusty earth aromas of shiitake, soy, dried cranberry and muddy soils show on the nose of this clonal study by Norm Yost. Dried red-plum flavors provide the backbone to the palate, where earthy sagebrush, forest moss and tangerine rind aspects combine for an intriguing sip. "
1629,Stella Bella Shiraz,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,32,13.9,4.0,8,"This has attractively fresh, red-plum aromas with a gently spicy edge. The palate is so softly delivered with a lick of spicy oak adding warmth to the finish. Drink now. "
1630,Domaine Johann Michel Cornas,2019,Syrah/Shiraz,France,73,14.5,0.0,0,"A wine that readers should snatch up is the 2019 Cornas from Johan Michel, a majestic, full-bodied, incredibly seamless beauty that does everything right. It certainly shows the ripe, sunny style of the vintage and brings ample fruit, richness, and power, yet it still has incredible focus as well as purity and freshness. Black raspberries, cassis, blueberries, violets, bacon fat, and peppery notes all emerge from the glass, and it has no hard edges and a sensational mouthfeel that keeps you coming back to the glass. This bursts forth with a torrent of dark plum, boysenberry and blackberry preserve flavors. Vivid, racy and energetic throughout, with extra sweet bay leaf, violet and black olive elements chiming through repeatedly, while a mouthwatering chalky minerality courses underneath it all. Best from 2024. "
1631,Skinner Grenache,2019,Grenache,California,29,13.5,3.9,12,"Vivid, sunbaked fruit flavors and a great structure of moderate acidity and tannins balance this wine out beautifully on a high level. Blackberry and raspberry notes mingle with hints of cedar, clove and black pepper for a tasty complexity "
1632,Domaine de la Mordoree Cotes Du Rhone La Dame Rousse Rose,2021,Rosé,France,25,0,0.0,0,"This estate makes brilliant rosé, and the 2021 Côtes Du Rhône Rosé might be the best I've tasted from the vintage. Ripe raspberries, white flowers, and beautiful minerality define the aromatics, and it's medium-bodied on the palate, with a fresh, elegant, almost crystalline-like texture that keeps you coming back to the glass. Seemingly in between a Provencal rosé and a Tavel, it's going to be incredibly versatile on the dinner table. Don't miss it. A generous and joyful Cotes-du-Rhone rosé with plenty of power, but also very good freshness. So much red-berry, nectarine and orange-peel character. Some real structure means that this won’t fade away if you forget a bottle in a corner for a few months. Drink or hold. "
1633,Allegrini Valpolicella,2020,Other Red Blends,Italy,17,13,3.8,11,"Pleasant nose with plummy and floral notes. Medium-bodied and silky smooth with well-integrated tannins and a flavorful finish. Aromas of red-skinned berries, spice and underbrush shape the nose. The easygoing palate shows ripe red cherry and white pepper alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon to catch the fruit richness. "

1635,Montes Alpha Series Carmenere,2019,Carmenere,Chile,19,14.5,3.8,27,"Black fruit, herbs, chili, black olives and spices on the nose. It’s full-bodied with chewy tannins. Creamy, but structured and fresh in the mouth. Layered with a flavorful finish. Drink or hold. The 2019 Carmernere Montes Alpha hails from Apalta and Marchigüe and is blended with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 55% aged for 12 months in French oak barrels. Rich violet in the glass. The nose delivers ripe blackberry aromas with hints of white and green pepper. Indulgent in the mouth with firm tannins, an ample, extractive palate and good body. The cleansing finish is of dark fruit. "
1636,Chateau Haut-Batailley,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,56,14.1,0.0,0,"This is linear and tight with blue fruit and fine tannins. Some graphite and lead pencil, too. Medium to full body with very Pauillac sensibility. Delicate, yet structured. Restrained. Needs time to open. 76% cabernet sauvignon. Best after 2026. Slightly darker fruited and denser than the more ethereally styled 2018, the 2019 Château Haut-Batailley offers up a gorgeous array of red and black currants, black raspberries, tobacco, and flowers, with more classic lead pencil and tobacco notes emerging with time in the glass. Balanced, medium to full-bodied, and concentrated, it has ripe, supple tannins, terrific mid-palate density, and a great finish. The quality continues to soar at this estate under the helm of the Cazes family and this is a gem of a Pauillac well worth seeking out. Give it a few years and enjoy over the following two decades. Best after 2024. A fine effort from this cru classé located between Lynch-Bages, Forts de Latour and Pichon Lalande, the 2019 Haut-Batailley offers up aromas of minty berries, loamy soil, violets, cedar and spices, followed by a medium to full-bodied, succulent palate with a pretty core of fruit, lively acids and powdery structuring tannins. This is the second vintage produced by the Cazes family since their acquisition of the château in 2017. Best after 2025. "

In a vintage that often delivers understated wines, this expression feels especially intense, ripe and thickly layered. Dark fruit, plum, earth and spice rose from the bouquet.

1638,DAOU Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,California,16,13.7,4.0,15,"25% Semillon. Governed from beginning to end by slightly juicy well-ripened fruit that smacks of fresh melons and pears with a trim of vanillin richness, this fairly full-bodied Sauvignon Blanc takes a marked turn away from the grassy and herbaceous traits of which the variety can be prone. It inclines to slightly gylceriny lushness to start then shows just the right degree of structural firmness on the palate and with rich, long-lasting flavors that exhibit fine fruity volume and weight. COMMENTARY: The 2021 DAOU Discovery Collection Sauvignon Blanc is appealing, delightful, and focused on its varietal character. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of light spices, light floral notes, and sandalwood. Pair it with linguine and clams in a creamy white wine reduction sauce.

A very fresh and elegant delivery of malagouzia, accentuated by purity and texture. Well made. Vegan. Drink now The 2021 Malagouzia Turtles Vineyard is unoaked, dry and comes in at 13.48% alcohol. In its youth, about three months in bottle when tasted, this is all about the youthful features—exuberant fruit, pungent aromatics, a fair bit of power for this grape and excellent depth. Big, ripe and intense, this might not always be the highest-personality offering in the brand, but right now I like it a lot in its own style. Expressive with melon fruits and limestone minerality. Crisp front palate with sappy nectarines with long and persistent salty aftertaste. "
1640,Foxen Block UU Bien Nacido Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,California,34,13.5,0.0,0,"The nose on this block-designated bottling is immensely intriguing, offering chalk, lemon peel and shiso leaf aromas. The palate is both tense in structure yet mouthfilling in flavor, with bright acidity delivering lemon glaze and light nut flavors into a chalky finish. The 2019 Chardonnay Bien Nacido Vineyard Block UU is bright, airy and wonderfully sculpted. White flowers, mint, white pepper and lemon peel are all finely-knit. As always, the UU Block Chardonnay is distinguished by its weightless personality, which makes it one of the most singular wines from Bien Nacido. The 2019 Chardonnay Bien Nacido Vineyard Block UU brings up the intensity with lots of buttered apple, toasted hazelnut, white flowers, and toasty notes in a pretty, pure, yet still tight and focused style. It should have 5-7 years of longevity and is a great value in California Chardonnay. The 2019 Chardonnay Bien Nacido Vineyard Block UU has a nose of white peaches, beeswax, honeysuckle and roasted almonds.

With its medium to full-bodied richness, present yet ripe tannins, and obvious sense of minerality on the finish, it would pass undetected in a lineup of top wines from the Médoc. It's terrific today, yet given its balance, purity, and structure, it's going to evolve for 20 years or more. Broad shouldered and powerfully structured, with deep blackberry, bay leaf and stony mineral flavors that finish with big but refined tannins. Drink now through 2030. French oak aromas are out front, with notes of dark roasted coffee bean, chocolate and toffee, along with cigar box accents. On the palate, the fruit is bright and juicy, exquisitely balanced, with an interplay of chocolate and spice barrel notes. It hangs on the finish. There's a pleasing sense of texture to it all.

This focused, fragrant red offers aromas of woodland berry, new leather, wild herb and pipe tobacco. The linear palate exhibits dried cherry, mocha and toasted nut set against close-grained tannins that leave a drying finish. Best After 2023 High-toned vanilla notes tie in with blue fruit purity.

Round and lush on the palate, with crystalline acidity and highly stimulating salinity, this is a dense, gorgeously piquant and mouth-filling Auslese with remarkable precision, grip and salinity on the finish. A firework display of exotic-fruit aromas that makes me want to abandon cloudy Northern Europe for the tropics! Such mouth-filling and sensual succulence makes it impossible to resist, but the best thing is the intense brilliance at the super-concentrated and very pure finish. Drink or hold.

It has a succulent edge of juicy acidity that sears the tannins and promises a great future. Drink from 2031. This has the plump sweetness of a Graham’s vintage, teeming with black fruit and saturated with tannins as chewy as the thick black skins of blueberries. Underneath the smoky oak tannins, there’s a gentle rose scent that hints at the wine’s development ahead. Malvedos, the vineyard central to the rich fruit style at Graham’s, benefitted from its north-facing exposition, especially in the sectors of old vines that Charles Symington features in the Stone Terraces bottling (also recommended here).

Bottled just a few weeks prior to my visit, the 2018 IGP Saint Guilhem le Desert Blanc was already looking good. Pear, melon and tangerine notes mingle on the nose of this medium-bodied blend of Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Petit Manseng and Viognier. Like always, it's a touch off-dry on the finish, balanced by some delicate Viognier-derived tannins and peppery spice. "

A blend of 98% Syrah and 2% co-fermented Viognier, it’s thrillingly dense and rich, with spectacularly deep, classy aromas of blackberry, charcoal, blood, lavender, and violets that literally soar from the glass. Incredibly concentrated and rich, this hits the palate with a full-bodied, dense, layered texture that partially conceals the massive underlying structure and tannin of the wine. The 2009 La Sangre de Jonata is very awkward at first, but gradually opens up to reveal huge fruit backed up by equally imposing, masculine tannin. If opened today, the wine will require quite a bit of air. Ideally, it is best left alone for several years. At this stage, the aromas and flavors are very much primary. It is the wine's textural elegance and layered personality that impress above all else. With air, the wine truly begins to blossom. In 2009, there is just a touch (1%) of Viognier in the blend. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2021. Dark and condensed, with a rich, focused core of supple-textured mineral and fresh earth—laced blackberry and wild berry flavors.

The 2014 Montlandrie, the Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux from Denis Durantou, is a blend of 75% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Franc and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon (yes, different to the percentages stated during primeur—happy to correct it now!). It offers attractive red cherry, wild strawberry and pastille-like scents on the pure bouquet, though maybe I discern a little more complexity on Denis' two Lalande-de-Pomerols, La Chenade and Les Cruzelles. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin.

While tightly wound in youth it should open from 2025 and improve well through 2030. An intense, concentrated and dynamic style. Very well balanced, with a great sense of freshness and energy. Lovely firm acid line running through it, and a long finish. One of the best Tradition cuvées this year, and certainly the best Chante Cigale Tradition rouge I've tasted from tank. The 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape (65% Grenache, 20% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre, and 5% Cinsault) offers a wonderfully pure, seamless style that carries lots of black cherry and blackberry fruits as well as Provençal garrigue, saddle leather, and peppery spice.

Very deep nose with wild-strawberry notes, colored by hints of cinnamon, nuts, dried flowers and a tinge of quite sweet balsamic. Medium-bodied with the same intensity and firm control.

Vibrant and bright with well-managed tannins, plenty of juicy and crunchy fruit and refreshing acidity. Pomegranate, wild red berries and flowers on the nose, following through to a juicy, medium-bodied palate with firm, dusty tannins. Very pristine and bright fruit profile, before a juicy, linear finish. Vegan. A very drinkable xinomavro. Uncork now The 2019 Xinomavro Hedgehog Vineyard was aged for 12 months in 50% new French barriques. It comes in at 14.02% alcohol. This feels a little delicate in the mid-palate, but it expands in the glass and coats the palate nicely eventually. Silky and bright, it has a fresh feel and a lively demeanor. The tannins are ripe here, not getting in the way too much, even with very young Xinomavro. The freshness is the biggest selling point. The acidity creates a juicy finish with the fruit lifted on the palate. This seems like a pretty nice Hedgehog this year. It should hold another decade or so, give or take. Xinomavro does not die easily. "

TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of blackberries, oak, and licorice. Enjoy its elegance with a nicely seasoned, first-cut of prime rib. (Tasted: October 9, 2021, San Francisco, CA) “This is a Grand Cru vineyard by Napa Valley standards,” winemaker Gustavo Gonzalez points out. “With Shafer’s Hillside as a backdrop, the volcanic soils from 25-year-old vineyards slope down to the Silverado Trail. The wine reminds me of St. Julien, with more acidity than Oakville and Rutherford.” Indeed, the high pitch of the fruit proves that point. Dappled with white and red pepper and a whisper of cumin, the wine offers a flourish of violets, black plum, and graphite. Espresso whooshes in on the finish, percolating with dark berries and earthy sage. "

There's a lovely vibrancy of color to this vintage of Pinot, and a raw energy. Oodles of crunchy fresh strawberry notes are backed by cinnamon, clove, flower stalks and stone. The sappy tannins have a surprising bite but an easy, natural presence rather than being oak-driven. There's beautiful fruit purity and an overall cool climate, unadulterated vibe. "

Super balance and quality here.  The Damilano 2017 Barolo Liste is a wine of considerable power and depth, although it happily remains firmly within the parameters of elegance and finesse that only a grape as important and versatile as Nebbiolo can manage. I love that duality of brawn and grace that coexist here. The warm 2017 vintage helps to turn up the volume even higher in this expression from Liste. It aged in large oak for 24 months.

Aged in Darnajou oak, this is an elegant wine, but it has serious intensity, a blue/purple color, sweet black raspberry and blueberry fruit, some forest floor and spring flowers. It is my favorite of the three vintages to date, although the 2015 has the potential to match it. Drink it over the next 20 years. "

The blueberry flavors feel a little loose and soft, but the tannins keep it in a clean, tight and spicy line that benefits from several days of air. Cellar this for a year or two before decanting with grilled lamb kabobs. Aromas of red-plum compote and creamy baking spices abound here.

The 2016 vintage offers both dried and fresh fruit tending towards forest berries. Accents of winter mint and sage animate the nose and add dimension to the palate. Generous, round fruit is hemmed in by soft tannins, though these become a bit dry and dusty on the finish. Ageing is in a combination of large casks and French oak barriques.

1719,Clos Apalta Le Petit Clos Apalta,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,Chile,41,14.5,4.2,14,"The 2018 Le Petit Clos, a second wine born in 2014, was produced with a blend of 53% Carmenere, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot from organically and biodynamically certified vineyards even if the bottled doesn't carry the seals. It's ripe and powerful with the Apalta signature, earthy and stony. It fermented with indigenous yeasts in oak vats and matured in French barriques for some 22 months. It's full-bodied with a lush texture and round tannins, a softer version of the 2016. A medium-bodied red with blackberry, red-berry and spice aromas and flavors. It’s chewy and polished with a medium finish. Dried flowers to the fruit at the finish. Tight and reserved now. Drink in 2022 and onwards.

The complex nose offers plum jam, hints of smoke, herbs and pepper against a backdrop of cigar box and graphite. A ripe, broad, full-bodied red with precise acidity and a juicy, grippy flow (quite accomplished for the style), it ends with an intense, ripe finish. A red to hold on to. "

I very much like the combination of texture and vibrancy displayed by the middle weight flavors that are notably finer as well as more complex on the balanced, bright and linear finale. This is a terrific Puligny villages and absolutely worth your interest. "
1721,Le Ragnaie Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,79,0,4.4,5,"The Le Ragnaie 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is a delicate and graceful expression that unfolds carefully to reveal wild berry, dried lilac and pretty earthy tones. This 26,000-bottle release fits into that enviable school of Brunello that prioritizes tradition, elegance and purity. These are the basic traits of a great Sangiovese, but they are not easily achieved by all. Le Ragnaie's identity is deeply linked with these efforts. Lifted notes of dried mint or Mediterranean herb appear on the close. Le Ragnaie’s ‘entry-level’ Brunello wasn’t impoverished by the estate’s single-vineyard bottlings. It shows dried pressed violets and plump crushed cherry right out of the gate, with great purity. The tannins are firm and grippy, giving support to a substantial core and crunchy finish. This red offers a mix of cherry, strawberry, floral and earth aromas and flavors. Tips to the dry, dusty tannins in the balance, but overall this lingers with hints of fruit and a sense of grace. "
1722,Fess Parker Clone 115 Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,60,14.1,0.0,0,"Opulent aromas of dried cherry, cola spice and loamy earth offer a comforting fatness on the nose of this clonal expression. The palate's mouthfeel is quite viscous but contained by a zesty acidity, as those dark-cherry-cola flavors arise. More fruit-filled and juicy, the 2019 Pinot Noir Clone 115 offers ample cherry and mulberry notes as well as background cigar, spice, and floral nuances. It too is medium-bodied and beautifully balanced, with lots of character. From Ashley’s, one of Fess Parker’s estate vineyards, this wine leads with scents of mulled spice, licorice and pfeffernüse adorning a dark plum core. For all the aromatic savor, there’s one pure, spicy, dark fruit-lined olive note delivered with finesse—for a mushroom tartelette. Medium ruby-purple, the 2019 Pinot Noir Clone 115 features red and blue berries on the nose with touches of baking spice, citrus peel and potpourri. The palate is medium-bodied, soft and juicy with spicy fruits and an uplifted finish. Best After 2022 "
1723,The Hilt Estate Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,California,44,13,0.0,0,"Starting with the appellation 2018 Chardonnay Estate, this wine has a vivid gold hue as well as classy notes of sliced apple, nectarines, and honeyed flowers, with just a hint of salinity and minerality. It's elegant, beautifully balanced, and has a great finish, all while staying in the more vibrant, fresh style of this estate. From the Jonata family’s Sta. Rita Hills estate, this wine feels anomalous from the get-go: Its first aromas are tense and sharp, of clay dust and lemon. But the flavors possess a melon-like breadth, like cantaloupe, giving the wine luxurious depth, only to have it tighten up with citrusy intensity, leaving a lasting mineral impression. "

This bottle would last, age and improve, probably for many years. Drink 2013-2020. Alluring, with a hint of salted caramel adding a hedonistic hint, while dried orange peel, green tea, walnut oil and singed juniper berry notes keep this decidedly on the dry, taut side.

Full to medium body, powerful and polished tannins and a long and flavorful finish. Tightly wound ball here. Exciting. The classical 2015 Viña Real Reserva is a blend of Tempranillo with 10% Garnacha, Mazuelo and Graciano from a warm and early harvest that fermented in stainless steel vats and aged in new oak barriques for 22 months with rackings every four months. I find it very expressive, aromatic and open, ripe and hedonistic but without excess. It has the soft and approachable profile of the Alavesa wines but with the grip of the fine-grained, chalky tannins. It's gentle but has clout. Earthy berry and plum aromas come with patented Rioja side notes of vanilla and tobacco, while this reserva from a warm but top-notch vintage feels dry and slightly choppy. Roasted, gamy plum and berry flavors show some buttery oak, peppery notes and a leafy accent in front of a meaty finish touched up by lemony hints. The 2015 Vina Real Reserva (90% Tempranillo and 10% Garnacha) has a pretty, fruit-filled nose of red and blue fruits, vanilla, spice, and cedarwood. With medium-bodied richness and a charming, sweetly fruited, balanced mouthfeel, it's well worth seeking out and will drink nicely for at least 4-6 years. "
1737,Rhys Vineyards Horseshoe Vineyard Pinot Noir,2012,Pinot Noir,California,115,0,0.0,0,"A ripe, layered effort that took plenty of air time to come together (I followed all of these wines over two days), the 2012 Pinot Noir Horseshoe Vineyard offers gorgeous cherry and raspberry-like notes to go with ample spice-box, dried flowers and smoky characteristics on the nose. Medium to full-bodied, seamless and elegant, it has solid mid-palate density, bright acidity and a big finish. This seemed slightly soft right on opening, but when I came back to the bottle a few hours later, it has come together brilliantly. This beauty should be at it's best from 2017-2027+. "

Exotic and distinctive, with enough tension to offset the headiness. The NV Venerable Pedro Ximenez is produced from sun-dried Pedro Ximenez grapes aged in a solera created in 1902 for an average of 30 years. It is dark, opaque mahogany color, and a distinct nose with a lactic and toasted note of toffee and cappuccino coffee that stands it apart from others. The wine is dense and concentrated, very sweet and low in acidity, with a long aftertaste of dark chocolate and dried figs. This is so dense and concentrated it feels like you could spread it with a knife. But put the texture aside for a moment and consider the tremendous complexity of the aroma: notes of figs, chestnuts, moist earth and caramelized nuts. Whatever you imagine, this vino-postre has it. One of a collection of rarities from Osborne, this comes from a solera established in 1902. "

The fine tannins give the long, straight finish excellent structure. "
1743,Philipponnat Royale Reserve Brut (375ML,half-bottle),Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,39,12,0.0,0,"This is the nonvintage Champagne from this producer. With its richness and high percentage of Pinot Noir, it reflects the house style. Touches of spice and a light structure give shape to the white fruits. Drink now. Focused on pinot noir (65 percent, particularly fruit from Mareuil-sur-Aÿ), this blend includes up to 30 percent reserve wines aged in oak barrels. The red fruit comes through in the wine’s scent of currants and in its gentle grip, its savor combining a sense of transparent red-grape skins and the refreshing acidity of fruit grown in limestone. Disgorged in June 2020 with eight grams per liter dosage, the latest release of Philipponnat's NV Brut Royale Réserve is based on the 2016 vintage, with 27% reserve wines. Offering up aromas of peach, pear and plum mingled with apple blossom and sweet pastry, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and expressive, with a pillowy mousse and a generous core of fruit, underpinned by bright acids. Always open in the exposition of the origins of its wines, Philipponnat has upped the stakes of late by not only adding foudres to its vinification armoury but also increasing volumes from two separate Réserves Perpétuelles. The result is impressive; Pinot power writ large in red fruit and biscuity complexity, with resonance on the back palate, the ensemble still harnessed by disarmingly energetic freshness. A fragrant element of lightly toasted hazelnut is a rich base note in this fine and creamy Champagne, layered with finely meshed flavors of baked white cherry, lemon curd, spun honey and pickled ginger. Plush in texture, with a fine spine of lemony acidity providing focus and definition. The current release of the NV Champagne Royale Reserve Brut is 69% Pinot Noir, 28% Chardonnay, and the rest Meunier, mostly from the 2018 harvest and 26% reserve wine. It has a pale straw color and is fresh with white flowers, ripe peach, and rounded brioche. The palate is approachable and refreshing, with pithy citrus of lemon and orange, red fruits, and bread dough. Its ripe but fresh style casts a large net. Best after 2022. "

The palate plays a similar game, with a chalky, cool depth and smooth, pithy texture, contoured with freshness and subtle, oaky smoke. This refined and elegant combination will stand the test of time. Here too there is just enough reduction present to push most of the nose to the background though subtle notes of wood and white flowers are discernible. More interesting are the succulent yet nicely tension-filled flavors where the wood telegraphed by the nose is picked up by the solidly long finale. "

It's a very fine, elegant example of Bandol rosé, with notes of passion fruit and pink grapefruit leading the way in a tightly knit, medium-bodied package that adds promising hints of white peach and anise on the lingering finish. Tightly coiled and dense, this is still inviting and begins to unfurl with time in the glass.

It shows dense tannins and concentrated black fruits contrasted by bright acidity that rises up on the finish. Drink from 2023. Shiverick Imports. The 2019 Alicante Bouschet was aged for one year in 40% new French oak. It comes in at 15.1% alcohol. Big and dense, this has fairly ripe tannins, notwithstanding some grip on the finish, but also very ripe fruit. The beefy nuances around the edges give this some complexity. In a similar style to the monovarietal Touriga reviewed this report, this seems like the better wine. This Alicante has better structure and more concentration. Of course, it also has all that Alicante personality and it is another $8. So reasonable minds might differ on what choice to make. This should age decently for several years, but the tannins are ripe enough so you can approach this now without a problem. It's worth leaning up for the moment, but this does have to demonstrate it can age a bit to justify my current enthusiasm. "

The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino La Casaccia takes a little longer to open, but it ultimately reveals the elegance and energy that comes with the house style. Wild cherry, ash and balsam herb drive a long, very polished finish. The La Casaccia site is distinguished by mineral-rich clay soils, which give this wine its power and density Inviting aromas of baked plum, violet, baking spice and sun-warmed hay come to the forefront along with a whiff of leather. The enveloping palate is delicious, delivering ripe Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and nutmeg framed in tightly woven, polished tannins that lend finesse and a smooth texture. Within the Canalicchio area, the Casaccia vineyard boasts a high clay content, which helped curb water stress in 2017. As with all Canalicchio di Sopra’s wines, the grapes were double-sorted to remove any green or sun-dried berries.

Ripe black cherries, forest floor, Asian spices, and chocolate notes all emerge on the nose, and it's full-bodied, ripe, and sexy on the palate, with sweet tannins, no hard edges, and wonderful overall balance. It dishes out tons of pleasure and is a much more approachable, forward wine compared to the Le Défi de Fontenil while still possessing the class to evolve for 10-15 years. Best after 2022. Plenty of sweet-tobacco, graphite, and dark-berry aromas follow through to a medium to full body with attractive ripe fruit and chewy yet round tannins.

1789,Hamilton Russell Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Africa,53,13.5,4.1,37,"Anthony Hamilton Russell hopes this will be a unique wine, being the only HR Pinot Noir to be made with bought-in grapes (generously sold to him by other high-quality producers) when fire hit the estate, with 84% of their own fruit affected. This is a blend of grapes from Upper Hemel-en-Aarde and the Ridge. Very approachable already, attractive red-fruits and a slight earthiness. A fine effort in trying circumstances. Labelled just Hamilton Russell, rather than Hamilton Russell Vineyards to distinguish. Before I begin my tasting note, I'd like to quickly focus on what Hamilton Russell has written on the back of their 2019 Pinot Noir label. While wildfires are not an uncommon occurrence for South Africa, it is refreshing to see such high integrity and transparency as Hamilton Russell has displayed in a challenging situation. Bottled as Walker Bay wine of origin, they had to reject almost all of their Pinot Noir vineyard fruit due to a wildfire. The estate stands to gain more trust and brand loyalty from their followers from the decision to be completely open and transparent about what happened to them and their Pinot Noir in 2019. I wish more of the world were as honest and transparent as Hamilton Russell has demonstrated to every consumer of this vintage. I don't know everything there is to know about building brand loyalty, but I am confident that the first chapter of that playbook begins with what Hamilton Russell has written on the back of this particular bottling.

The medium to full-bodied palate is firm and crunchy with bags of bright fruit and a grainy texture, finishing lifted. The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Signature is a terrific wine and a big overachiever in its price range. Black cherry, plum, mocha, lavender, spice, licorice and new leather lend tons of complexity to this bold, luscious Cabernet. This overt, upfront Cabernet offers plenty of near and medium-term appeal. Best after 2022. Packs an alluring, winey feel, with a well of cassis and plum reduction laced with hints of cocoa, tobacco and singed cedar.

Best after 2010. 6,000 cases made. The racy, precise nature of this beautiful wine underlines the beautiful winemaking here.

1833,Bodegas Muga Prado Enea Gran Reserva (1.5 Liter Magnum),2015,Tempranillo,Spain,209,14.5,0.0,0,"The most classical of their wines, the 2015 Prado Enea Gran Reserva is a blend of Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo and Graciano, mostly from Rioja Alta (Sajazarra, Cellorigo and Fonzaleche), but the Garnacha is from different plots in the zone of Tudelilla at high altitude. These grapes are always picked last, but the wine has a similar alcohol level as the rest, around 14.5% in a warm year like 2019. The modus operandi is similar to other of the top cuvées—harvested into 200-kilogram boxes, destemming, optical sorting and fermentation in small oak casks with indigenous yeasts. The élevage in this case is extended to 36 months, and the barrels are only 10% new. This is, year in, year out, my favorite wine from Muga, and in this powerful and ripe year, these late-harvesting vines ripened thoroughly and delivered a full array of aromas and flavors so that the wine has plenty of depth and complexity. It has a very classical profile, with incipient tertiary notes, perfumed, floral and rich, textured and beautifully balanced. They compare this 2015 with 2009 and 2005 in terms of style but with freshness in the style of 2001 and 2010. It's enjoyable but should also develop for a long time in bottle. One of the finest Prado Enea vintages. Reserved and polished, this is a Prado Enea with great class and focus. It’s so aromatic,with plum, peach, cherry and cedar character. Salted olives, too. Medium-to full-bodied with very fine tannins and a long, fresh finish. Elegance with power here. Give it three or four years to open, but already impressive. The 2015 Prado Enea Gran Reserva comes from a hotter, riper vintage, but it shares similar gamey, exotic aromatics of red and black fruits, sappy herbs, flowers, leather, iron, and background cedary oak. Rich, medium to full-bodied, incredibly pure, and balanced, it has ripe, still present tannins, impeccable balance, and a great finish. This is a classic expression of this cuvée that can be enjoyed any time over the coming two decades or more. Well-tailored in an understated way, this harmonious red is plushly creamy on the palate, like fine cashmere, showing seamless integration of the sculpted tannins with finely detailed flavors of black cherry and black plum reduction, sandalwood, cedar, green olive, espresso crema and minerally smoke and iron. Long and lightly juicy on the refined finish. Tempranillo, Graciano, Mazuelo and Garnacha. "
1834,Snowden Brothers Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,89,14.7,0.0,0,"The 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon Brothers Vineyard is gorgeous. In this vintage, the Brothers has a bit more tannin and overall structure than normal, but in 2017 a power outage resulted in the wine staying in tank for an extra ten days. In the end, that looks to have been a help, as the 2017 offers a terrific combination of fruit density and structure, within the mid-weight style of the year at Snowden. This is a beguiling wine that may very well turn out to be a surprise in time. Super classic, old-school, medium-bodied wine with good depth and resonance alongside notes of black cherry, leather, tobacco, licorice and gravel. Succulent and open in feel, with friendly plum and raspberry puree notes set on a silky structure, backed by light rooibos tea and anise hints. A stylish Cabernet, offering an alluring mouthfeel.

Turns even more tense and sinewy on the finish, where earth and tobacco accents echo. Best from 2025 through 2043. Aromas of wild strawberries, raspberries and rose petals, as well as sous-bois notes of damp leaves and mushrooms. Medium-bodied with firm tannins and a long, focused finish. Showing some structure for 2018. Needs plenty of time. Best from 2025. The Paolo Conterno 2018 Barolo Ginestra is a little muddled in appearance with a hint of grayish garnet. The wine's color may not be totally luminous, but the bouquet is quite articulate with wild berry, aniseed, licorice and blood orange. There is a pronounced layered of oak spice at the back (following extended aging in traditional botti) that will need more time to integrate. The wine ends with a combination of sour cherry, dusty limestone earth and 15% alcohol. "

This wine is sourced from two vineyards, and the grapes were fermented by vineyard in stainless steel with indigenous yeasts and matured in French oak barrels for 26 months. This is very young and primary, with harmonious tannins but in need of time in bottle to deliver what's inside. As with the other 2018s, this has complexity and depth; the wine is juicy, and the tannins are not hard. There is great balance and superb aging potential. 43,362 bottles produced. It was bottled in February 2021. Dark-violet-red in the glass, this wine has a nose of fruit of the wood, purple flowers and elderberry. It enters the palate soft and spicy, with notes of clove and menthol. Luxurious tannins slowly build, bearing flavors of blackberry, black cherry and citrus blossom that fade into a mellow finish. Drink through 2043. The volume is turned up on the flavors of Kalamata olive, black fig, creamy melted licorice, mocha and Mediterranean scrub in this full-bodied red, with equal amplitude from the dense, plushly textured tannins and underscoring minerality. Lively and expressive throughout, with a cedar-laced, lingering finish. Tempranillo. Best from 2023 "

1841,Molino Real Malaga Molino Real (500 ML),2015,Muscat,Spain,77,13.5,0.0,0,"I still have to visit the vineyards where they produced the 2015 Molino Real, the stunning sweet Moscatel from Málaga. The grapes are sourced from up to nine hectares of vines on slate slopes at elevations that range between 350 and 1,000 meters. The grapes are sun dried to further concentrate the juice and then pressed with oil presses separated by esparto grass mats, like it was done in the past. They tell me they need 2.5 kilos of grapes to obtain one liter of juice. Fermentation is long and happens in 225-liter oak barrels, where the wine matures at low temperature for 20 months. This feels sooooo young and tender, undeveloped and reticent compared with the 2013 and 2014 I tasted next to it. These wines need at least five years to start showing their true colors. It's faintly minty, not really grapey, but balsamic, with faint notes of bitter orange marmalade. The one thing I also like is that this wine is never overwhelmingly sweet and feels fresher. It's hard to guess what's going to happen with this wine in a few years, but I think it will evolve beautifully. "

There are pungent aromas of acacia flower, honey, tuberose and sweet peach. The nice thing is that these aromas feel slightly more controlled or contained compared to other neighboring expressions of this grape from the Italian Dolomites. Those honey-like favors cede to baked apple and custard cream. Best After 2022 A creamy white, backed by orange peel acidity and showing a well-spiced and aromatic range of baked melon, pink grapefruit sorbet and hints of fresh basil and lychee.

Deep purple, with a heavenly bouquet of creme de cassis, blueberries, scorched earth, crushed violets, tobacco, and earth, this beauty is full-bodied, has incredible depth of fruit, ripe, present tannins, integrated acidity, and a great finish. This estate has been on fire of late, and this is undoubtedly a worthy follow-on to the otherworldly 2015 and 2016. It has the depth of fruit and texture to offer pleasure even today, yet a solid 7-8 years of cellaring are warranted, and it should be long-lived. Bravo! With a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this wine is solidly tannic, with intense acidity to balance the ripe berry flavors and structure. The wine is destined for long aging with its structure and powerful tannins. At the same time, juicy acidity gives vibrancy. Drink from 2024. "

Powerful, full-bodied, and concentrated on the palate, it's beautifully done, has ripe, present tannins, and a great finish. It ranks with the gems in this solid vintage and will benefit from just short-term cellaring and cruise for 20-25 years or more in cold cellars. This dark, smoky wine comes from a vineyard close to the walls of Saint-Emilion. The smokiness goes with the impressive core of dry tannins and concentrated structure that supports the rich blackberry flavors. The wine is going to age well; drink from 2024. Very pure, with clearly defined plum, blackberry and black cherry preserve flavors gliding through, gently infused with anise and black tea details along the way. The fruit is so seductive you might miss the sneaky, graphite-edged grip that builds through the finish, promising solid cellaring potential. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2022 through 2038. This has a level of composure and energetic fruit on the palate that sets it above the rest in 2017. The nose has fresh blue fruit and hints of graphite and slate. The palate is succulent and juicy, right through to the very long finish. Drink or hold. An impressive Clos Fourtet, delivering in bottle as it did during En Primeur. Plenty of saffron-edged plum and firm tannins, you get the limestone tightness to the texture but it is spliced against fleshy black fruits. I feel pretty sure this will close up tightly over the next few years, and will go the distance in terms of ageing.

Layered, complex and satisfying, this ends on toasty warmth and supple generosity. Rich, warm caramel and dried plum aromas lead to a soft mouthful of red fruits with striking peppery notes, nuttiness and coffee. The NV Quinta da Ervamoira Tawny RP 10 Year Old Port comes in at 106 grams per liter of residual sugar. This is the new 2015 bottling. Beautifully focused and balanced, this has fine mid-palate weight for the category and a complex medley of concentrated flavors on the finish. Quite gripping, it is beautifully done and rather impressive, while always remaining graceful and impeccably balanced. There is very respectable tension on the finish, too, that enlivens the wine. Taste this in isolation and you'll think my score is pretty stingy, but remember that there does need to be some headroom when we step up to the long-aged Tawny treasures. This may have been my favorite 10 Year Tawny this issue. From the farthest reaches of the upper Douro, Quinta da Ervamoira has produced this sun-drenched wine, with great raisin flavors that vie with a fruity red-berry character. Both sweet from the dried fruits and dry from the intense acidity, with a light cocoa aftertaste, it is a balanced wine that can be drunk now. A fiery wood-style port, the Ramos Pinto 10 year Tawny shows a nice juxtaposition of red fruit and creamy wood. The wine's medium to full bodied palate and lively aftertaste make an excellent choice with a milk chocolate mousse topped with fresh whipped cream. (Tasted: October 27, 2016, San Francisco, CA) "

Drink this beauty over the coming 4-6 years. Best After 2022 "
1884,Chateau Haut-Bergey,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,24,13.9,3.6,6,"Aromas of ripe berries, licorice, leather and bark. Some dark-chocolate, too. Medium-bodied, polished and soft with firm tannins. Velvety finish with hints of flowers and crushed stones. Very subtle and fine. From biodynamically grown grapes with Demeter certification. Best after 2024. The 2019 Haut Bergey offers up a rich bouquet of earthy blackberry fruit, burning embers and red berry compote. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and generous, with powdery tannins and succulent acids, it's round and giving, with a slight fragility to its flavors that makes me think it will be at its best in the near term. Best after 2021. COMMENTARY: The 2019 Chateau Bergey is authentic and classic. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits Old World aromas and flavors of rustic spices and dried earth notes.

1885,Philip Togni Tanbark Hill Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,84,0,0.0,0,"Inviting, with ripe raspberry and black currant fruit stitched with singed apple wood, tobacco, menthol and sweet bay leaf. Reveals a bit of tarry grip on the finish, along with a cast iron hint, but should round into form soon enough. The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Tanbark Hill Vineyard is soft, open-knit and an absolute delight to taste today. Silky contours wrap around a core of red berry fruit, rose petal and spice. This gracious, understated Cabernet Sauvignon is a real charmer. Best After 2022 "
1886,Quinta do Noval Vintage Port,2018,Port,Portugal,125,19.5,0.0,0,"Juicy and muscular, with a ball of plum paste, warmed fig compote and black currant reduction flavors that need time to unwind. Ample graphite- and bramble-accented grip underscores the fruit on the finish, while a ganache note finds room to strut its stuff in the end. Should be one of the longer-lived wines of the vintage. Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Cão, Sousão and Tinta Roriz. The peppercorn spice driving this wine’s youthful exuberance led one taster to compare it to a syrah from Hermitage. Others described the flavor as akin to tart wild grapes, huckleberries, black currants… The wine is, in fact, packed with fruit, held tight by that peppercorn-like reduction, bursting out of its velvet seams. As Michael Kowalski of Miraval Berkshires in Lenox, Mass., noted, “It’s going places, but it’s not there yet.” Built to cellar. "
1887,Bodegas Raul Perez Castro Candaz A Boca do Demo Tinto,2019,Mencia,Spain,58,0,0.0,0,"I love the floral and expressive nose of the 2019 A Boca do Demo, which fermented in oak vats and matured in 1,000-liter oak foudre.

Medium body, creamy tannins and a savory finish The Pio Cesare 2018 Langhe Nebbiolo gives us an easy and transparent view of this mighty grape from Piedmont.

This vintage offered moments of heat and moments of coolness, and the whole approach is balanced quite nicely in this bottle. I give it a solid 10-year drinking window, and you get great value. Fresh nose of minty cassis, summer pudding and mulberry with smoky undertones. Inviting and vibrant, mellow on the palate. "
1892,Aldo Conterno Colonnello Barolo,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,200,15,0.0,0,"A tight nose, but the aromas of dark-red berries and violets are very pretty. Some nice forest-floor notes blend in well. Full-bodied with very well-formed tannins that show both polish and finesse, providing a solid backbone to the wine, but without being chewy. The finish is long and controlled, guided by the super tannins. Excellent winemaking. They got the best out of the vintage here.  Sun-kissed hay, cherry, plum, iron and tar flavors are the highlights of this expressive red. Dense and firmly structured, with a tightly knit, tannic finish.  "

Full-to medium-bodied and focused with firm, grainy but not chewy tannins that push the fruit and oak-spice through the long finish. Very nicely structured for the vintage. Give it a few years for the wine to blossom. 	 This has fine depth and intensity to the mulled plum, leather, sweet tobacco, camphor, tar and oak spice aromas and flavors. Boasts a broad, dense structure, with tannins that dominate the finish for now. Shows fine balance, length and complexity, but this just needs time.  "

Lots of lovely fruit and balance here. Drink or hold. COMMENTARY: The Napa Valley is one of Cabernet Sauvignon's greatest epic centers in the wine world. Far too often, the wines come across as heavy or ponderous. While the power of this grape variety is present, so is the alcohol and tannins. Fortunately, the 2014 Arietta Cabernet Sauvignon rises above it all. TASTING NOTES: This wine is beautiful and stylish. Its aromas and flavors of red and black fruit, as well as a shading of oak, making it a perfect pairing partner with a standing rib roast. (Tasted: September 17, 2018, San Francisco, CA) The 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon, which comes from Coombsville, is a blend of 91% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. A classic, cool-climate Cabernet Sauvignon with plenty of minerality, spice box, underbrush, forest floor and earth with red and blackcurrants in the background. The wine is medium to full-bodied and tightly knit compared to the other Ariettas and therefore should be cellared for several more years and drunk over the following 15-20. As much coaxing as I gave this wine, it remained somewhat reticent, but promising. 90+ points "

Medium to full-bodied, this velvety-textured beauty delivers peppery spices, hints of clove and cumin and mulberry-like fruit, then ends long, with a touch of licorice. It's a treat to taste a wine with some bottle age that's still readily available. From Giesen's 26-year-old organically farmed hillside vineyard, age has transformed this wine into something very perfumed. With the same polish and flash as the 2016, there's now a touch of volatility acting to lift the blackberry and blueberry fruit, potpourri florals and peppery earthy spice to new heights. The palate still shows lots of tannic grip and the fruit here is holding up well. This still has at least another five to seven years left in it. COMMENTARY: The Giesen family has produced some of New Zealand's top wines. The 2013 Clayvin Syrah is another notch on their belt. TASTING NOTES: This New World Syrah is overtly fruity and rich. Its aromas and flavors of nicely-focused black fruit show up ripe and delicious on the palate. Pair it with roast duck in a white wine reduction sauce. (Tasted: September 18, 2019, San Francisco, CA) Bursting with black cherry, baked tamarillo, vanilla and spice aromas; sweetly fruity and quite substantial on the palate, with firm grip and juicy acidity.

1899,Best's Great Western Bin No 1 Shiraz,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,24,14,3.7,30,"Distinctive, cool-climate aromas of red berries, pepper, toasted spices, bacon fat and cocoa, sitting in fresh, complex mode. The palate is elegant, fine and fresh with long, silky tannins delivering fresh red-plum and blackberry flavors. Silky finish From one of Australia’s most treasured estates, this cool-climate Shiraz from western Victoria is a little meaty and mushroomy at first, the plum and currant fruit trailing just behind. It has cola-like polish from the oak influence and an underbelly of flowers and spices. Despite the fruit plushness on the palate, there’s still verve, freshness and a smudged charcoal texture to the powerful tannins. Drink now–2025. "

1903,Hermann J. Wiemer Dry Riesling,2020,Riesling,U.S.,21,12,3.9,15,"Beautiful fresh-pineapple aroma with hints of yellow grapefruit zest, candied lemon and graphite. Excellent balance of stone-fruit juiciness, medium body and citrusy freshness. Quite a compact mid-palate, then an impressive finish with mineral tension and a graphite note.  The 2020 Dry Riesling comes in with seven grams of residual sugar and 12.1% alcohol. This is a blend of vineyards, often a very good value in the somewhat pricey lineup. It is again. This year, in its youth, it has a touch of sugar around the edges, a friendly feel and a lush finish. It doesn't have the steely hints that, relatively speaking, the 2019 could sometimes project, granting that they are not here together. They look the same on paper, but at least from recollection, they are at least a little different in style, feeding into the stereotypes of the 2019/2020 vintage styles. There is certainly reasonable acidity on the finish here with some tension cutting the fruit and sugar, but this is firmly in the friendly puppy style. If someone told me it was close to a semi-dry, I wouldn't necessarily have been shocked. Best After 2022 "

Full-bodied, dense and layered with lots of berries and dark chocolate. Fresh and vibrant. Best ever? Drink in 2021. Laden with wood as much as rich fruit, this is a fully structured wine. Dark toast is prominent at this young stage although this will go as the wine balances out. Then it will be a dense wine full of black fruits and with balanced tannins and acidity. Drink from 2021. Transforming the Médoc into an international star, the 2014 Château Les Grands Chênes brings power onto the palate. The wine's forceful ripe fruit flavors and excellent concentration pair it well with slowly-braised beef dishes. (Tasted: October 11, 2017, San Francisco, CA) "
1906,Chateau Fleur La Mothe,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,16,14.5,3.9,83,"Quite a range of red and black-fruit aromas, plus a hint of eucalyptus, make this a very appealing, medium-bodied Médoc that has nice, velvety tannins and a polished finish for this appellation.

Medium to full body. Linear and bright finish. Shows focus and beauty. One of the best riservas from here in years. The 2016 Chianti Classico Riserva Croce reveals a dark and enriched quality of fruit with blackberry, plum, blackcurrant and exotic spice. Despite the power and concentration of the bouquet, though, the mouthfeel does not open to the same magnitude or power. This wine tapers down in terms of texture and palate impact, and this is a good thing. The wine is big on top (at the aromatic level) and more streamlined in texture. This Riserva would find a friend in a blackened salmon. "

Rita Hills. It was brought up in one-third new French oak and saw plenty of lees contact. This medium gold effort offers a complex bouquet of ripe stone fruits, sappy herbs, salty minerality, and ample spice.

1916,Site Larner Vineyard Grenache,2017,Grenache,California,54,0,0.0,0,"The 2017 Grenache Larner Vineyard is laced with the essence of sweet red cherry, pomegranate, mint and blood orange, that are all kicked up a few notches by bright acids. The 2017 needs a few years in bottle to be at its best, but it is very clearly a stunning wine just the same. Moving to the reds, the 2017 Grenache Larner Vineyard checks in as a blend of 88% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 2% Viognier sourced all from the Larner Vineyard in Ballard Canyon, and aged 18 months in neutral puncheons. Vivid blackberry fruits, notes of ground pepper, violets, and ground herbs, medium to full body, and remarkable purity of fruit all make for an incredibly compelling Grenache blend. However, it’s firm, focused, and concentrated on the palate, so give it a year or two. The 2017 Grenache Larner Vineyard is a blend of 88% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 2% Viognier and was bottled a couple days before I tasted it. Deep ruby-purple, it's a bit shy at the moment, hinting at dusty earth, aniseed, garrigue and floral tinges over a dense core of black and blue fruit preserves. The palate is full-bodied—a very rich, dense style of Grenache—with rich fruits, firm, chewy tannins and just enough freshness, finishing long and savory. "
1917,Rhys Vineyards Alpine Vineyard Pinot Noir,2010,Pinot Noir,California,119,13.7,0.0,0,"In this vintage, the 2010 Pinot Noir Alpine Vineyard is one of the more immediate wines in the lineup. It has plenty of fruit and depth, but not quite the complexity or layered personality of the very best wines in the Rhys lineup. Today it comes across as a bit one-dimensional, with pure power reigning over all else. This is one of the riper wines in the range and it displays its wood treatment a bit more prominently as well with cassis, plum, spice and dried rose petal scents. There is good volume and a seductive mid-palate as there is good concentration and sap to the delicious yet entirely serious finish that is supported by firm but not aggressive tannins. This is really very good, if a bit of an outlier stylistically. "

This is a picture-book NV Brut. No indication of disgorgement given. "
1919,Domaine Remi Jobard Monthelie Vignes Rondes Premier Cru,2018,Pinot Noir,France,74,13,0.0,0,"This displays some post-bottling reduction, but the underlying fruit clearly seems ripe. The round and nicely concentrated medium-bodied flavors also possess a succulent mid-palate before concluding in a firm, dusty and mildly austere finish that is firmer but not quite as complex. This too is going to require at least a few years of cellaring first before it will be reasonably accessible. "

1923,Yalumba The Signature Cabernet/Shiraz,2018,Other Red Blends,Australia,79,14.5,0.0,0,"Since its first release in 1962, The Signature has been Yalumba's deep dive into the classic Australian blend from the Barossa and one that honors the people who have enhanced the traditions and culture of Yalumba. There is a resonance and depth to this release that I really like. Wonderfully pure and concentrated blackberry and plum fruits, layered with spice, dark chocolate, earth, cedar and oak nuance. Succulent and sinewy in the mouth, it flexes considerable muscle, yet remains purely fruited and approachable even at this stage of its evolution. Rich and balanced with fine, ripe tannin and plenty of energy for such depth of fruit. Lovely. Ideal vintage conditions set the stage for this impressive blend – worth waiting for after no Signature was released in 2017. Polished and showy from the off, it exudes concentrated, ripe red plum and boysenberry aromas, with a whiff of vanilla and cedar. There's a caramel oak sweetness on the palate, like a plush velvet-textured cloak over dense, herbal bramble fruit, supported by fine chocolatey tannins and balancing acidity. Vibrant yet forceful. "

This is tightly wound, with a fine weave of tannins supporting black cherry, raspberry and violet flavors. Spice and mineral accents chime in as this winds its way down to the long, fruit- and spice-tinged aftertaste. Best from 2024 through 2042. 35 cases imported. "
1930,Robert Craig Cellars The Stick Howell Mountain Red Blend,2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,169,14.8,0.0,0,"A red with blackberries and hints of plums and some chocolate. It’s medium-bodied with round tannins and a fruity finish. Very attractive now, but can age. "
1931,Arietta On The White Keys White Blend,2021,Bordeaux White Blends,California,79,14.9,0.0,0,"So much going on in this exotic and intense blend of 87% sauvignon blanc and 13% semillon. Tropical and ripe, with jack fruit, guava, spices and dried golden berries. Creamy, medium-to full-bodied palate that’s shimmering with energy. "
1932,Castello di Volpaia Balifico,2018,Tuscan Blends,Italy,89,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2018 Balifico, Volpaia's Sangiovese/ Cabernet Sauvignon blend, is fabulous. Rich and inky, the 2018 offers up a compelling mélange of dark berry fruit, dark spice, licorice and espresso. I especially admire the wine's textural richness. I imagine the 2018 will drink well for many, many years to come. In this tasting it is a total knock-out. Alluring violet, black currant and black cherry fruit introduces this seductive red, with firm, pointed tannins and vivid acidity providing structure as this glides to a lingering, detailed finish. Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now through 2037. "
1933,Donatella Cinelli Colombini Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,79,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino is balanced and bright with lots of luscious primary fruit. The wine opens to soft tones of cherry, dried raspberry, crushed flowers and spice. It moves over the palate with mid-weight intensity, imparting plenty of Sangiovese freshness along the way. A dense, solidly built red, with wild herb, eucalyptus and soy aromas enveloping the core of cherry and plum fruit. Balanced and lingers nicely on the fruity, savory and tobacco-tinged aftertaste. Best from 2025. Sweet berries and dried flowers with cedar and sandalwood. Medium-to full-bodied with chewy yet fine tannins that are long and persistent. It’s a little tight at the end, suggesting that another two or three years of bottle age will give it a little more open and refined character. Try after 2023. "
1934,Villa Creek Rocks and Flowers,2020,Rhone Red Blends,California,45,14.3,0.0,0,"Polished and richly textured, with elegantly layered raspberry, cinnamon and smoked pepper flavors that finish with zesty, savory tannins. Grenache, Mourvèdre and Carignan.  "

TASTING NOTES: This wine is bright, fresh, and loaded with excellent ripe fruits. Its aromas and flavors of apple, peach skin and mineral last long on the palate and in the finish. Pair it with chicken thighs and grilled peaches over a bed of spinach. (Tasted: March 12, 2019, San Francisco, CA) "
1936,Stephane Coquillette Brut Carte,d'Or,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,49,12,0.0,0,"The new release of Coquillette's NV Brut Premier Cru Carte d'Or is showing well, mingling notes of fresh peach and lemon oil with hints of verbena and toasted nuts.

Lively but gourmand, it's the most charming, immediate wine in the Desvignes' cellar. Shimmering violet. Vibrant red and blue fruit aromas and a hint of lavender on the fragrant nose. Bright, spicy and focused on the palate, displaying fresh raspberry and boysenberry flavors that deepen and become spicier with air. Shows sappy, seamless character and fine clarity on the gently tannic finish, which echoes the red fruit and floral notes. Best after 2022 "
1940,Maximin Grunhaus Abtsberg Riesling Auslese (375ML half-bottle),2018,Riesling,Germany,38,8,4.1,15,"Picked rather late, in the middle of October, the radiant golden 2018 Maximin Grünhaus Abtsberg Riesling Auslese opens with super clear, perfectly ripe and flinty fruit aromas that intertwines ripe peach and mango with crushed blue slate and bitter orange zest notes. Exciting! On the palate, this is a lush, beautifully balanced and seamlessly textured Abtsberg Auslese with a long, salty-piquant, tightly woven and mouthwatering finish. It's still tight and firm, and the grip gives a nearly dry sensation that makes this a great dinner wine—if only you have the patience to wait a decade or more. There is great terroir expression here and nearly no botrytis. Some profoundly mineral notes are coming through on the nose, ranging from white pepper to slate to yuzu and lemon pith. Medium-bodied with delightful juiciness to the acidity and integrated stone fruit and marginal, filigree sweetness. Drink now or hold. "
1941,Garage Wine Co. Bagual Vineyard Lot 96 Carignan-Garnacha-Mataro,2018,Other Red Blends,Chile,39,14,3.1,6,"The 2018 Bagual Vineyard Cariñena Garnacha Monastrell marked with lot #96 (in the past, this wine has been bottled with numbers 76, 66, 56 and 46) comes from the same vineyard as the pure Garnacha—only 1.1 hectares of old vines with a field blend of the three varieties (even if the Garnacha was regrafted much later). Also like the pure Garnacha, this 2018 is rounder and has better quality tannins than the 2019. This is earthy and very much marked by the Cariñena character, with good ripeness and freshness. Malolactic usually takes around seven months, and the élevage is extended over two winters in third use or older, well-seasoned and neutral barrels. This reminds me of an elegant Priorat. The 2018 Cariñena Garnacha Monastrell Bagual Vineyard Lot 96 is a blend of equal parts Garnacha and Cariñena with 10% Monastrell from Caliboro, Maule, that spent two winters in barrel. Vivid violet red in color. The complex nose presents notes of sour cherry, strawberry, liqueur, rum cake and a little stock. Intense in the mouth, where the firm, free-flowing tannins of the Cariñena set the tone while freshness keeps everything light on its feet. An energetic, slightly alcoholic wine made in a new style. "
1942,Ritual Casablanca Valley Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Chile,21,14,0.0,0,"A medium-bodied red with aromas of wild raspberries, porcini, dried herbs and smoked meat. Powdery, fine tannins with a chalky feel. Concentrated and taut with a savory, mineral finish. Drink or hold. "

1944,Chateau Clos Marsalette (Futures Pre-Sale),2020,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,21,14,0.0,0,"Very sleek and tightly focused, with a long, thin, piercing iron note through the middle of a core of red currant and loganberry fruit, all flanked in turn by subtle alder and red tea. Flashes a mouthwatering edge on the finish, too. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. "
1945,Craggy Range Winery Kidnappers Vineyard Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,Zealand,25,13,0.0,0,"This has gorgeous minerality with precise layers of crushed stones, white peaches, dried lemons, cedar, chalk and pie crust. Creamy with a medium to full body and bright acidity. Flinty and chalky layers hold long.  The Kidnappers Vineyard lies on the Hawke's Bay coast, making for a cooler site that's often picked a few weeks later than the warmer, inland Gimblett Gravels site. As a result, it is a completely different style. The 2021 Chardonnay Kidnappers Vineyard Hawke's Bay is all about precision and pizzazz, the bright, coastal site bringing vitality and tension. There's very little evidence of oak here in terms of flavor, allowing the pineapple, pear, honeydew melon and lemon brightness to shine. That said, the medium-bodied core offers weight and roundness, shaped by puncheon and only a small 10% in new barrel and left on lees. This is a wine that might not seem immediately impressive, but the raw material has the goods, and it's rather cleverly crafted, providing a finely structured account of itself. "
1946,Villa Maria Private Bin Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Zealand,19,13.5,3.6,10,"This is a bouncy, fresh weeknight Pinot from one of New Zealand’s most well known names.

Drink slightly chilled in the spring or summer.. "

1948,Domaine de Montbourgeau L'Etoile Savagnin,2017,Savagnin,France,54,0,0.0,0,"The 2017 L'Etoile Savagnin is muted and not very expressive when poured from the bottle. It was produced with grapes from two plots on gray and blue marl soils, and it fermented in stainless steel and aged in 228-liter oak barrels that were initially full but never topped up. The effect of the flor is, however, quite mild this year; it's smoky more than spicy and has an ashy touch. The palate feels more expressive and pungent, dry and balanced but without the clout and complexity of the great vintages. "
1949,San Filippo Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,79,14,0.0,0,"Sweet berry, cherry and floral aromas with some dried fruit as well. Hint of cedar. Full-bodied and chewy with lots of fruit, tannins and vanilla. Big and rich. But still fresh. Try after 2024.

1953,Calcu Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,20,14,3.8,12,"Grapes grown on granitic soils with high clay content near the Pacific yield concentrated aromas and flavors that pour out of this delightful red. Scents of Luxardo cherry and vanilla lead to a brilliant mouthfeel. Cherry skin and sweet tobacco coat the palate with silky yet structured tannins. Vibrant notes of cocoa and coffee bean add to the juicy, generous fruit and the spiced cedar finish. The 2018 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon, also contains 8% Cabernet Franc, 3% Carmenere and 2% Petit Verdot from their estate vineyards. It fermented in stainless steel with selected yeasts and matured in French oak barrels for 12 months. It's ripe without excess and has good balance, a soft varietal profile with notes of berries, spices and a faint touch of oak. It's medium to full-bodied, with grainy tannins and a dry finish. "
1954,Domaine Nico Histoire d'A Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Argentina,52,14,0.0,0,"I find some similarities in the 2019s with gourmand aromas, a little riper and showier than the 2018s. The 2019 Histoire d’A Pinot Noir was produced with grapes from a plot with shallow soils in the Adrianna Vineyard in Gualtallary, 1.75 hectares planted in 1998 with clone 115 at 1,350 meters in altitude. It fermented in 600-liter oak roll fermentors with 20% full clusters and matured in French oak barrels for 18 months. It's fresh and elegant but showier than the 2018, with notes of sour cherries and decayed violets. It's a fresh and elegant Pinot with very fine and chalky tannins. 4,560 bottles were filled in December 2020. From Gualtallary, Uco Valley, the 2019 Pinot Noir Histoire d'A was 20% fermented in whole bunches and spent 18 months in 1/3 new barrels. Light, refined garnet in hue. The complex nose is shaped by the variety and the aging process, offering notes of rose, sour cherry and damp earth alongside cinnamon and nutmeg. Intense in flavor, the palate is expansive but also finely grained and precise. An acidity lends vigor and lightness without affecting the silky, velvety feel. Ends with a lengthy finish in which the fruit takes charge, helped by the freshness. "
1955,Chateau German,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,12,14.5,3.6,127,"Attractive plum, iodine and stone aromas follow through to a medium body with creamy and chalky tannins and an attractive berry and chocolate aftertaste. Drink or hold. "

Deep ruby/purple-hued, it has rock star purity in its cassis and ripe blackberry fruits as well as spicy oak, roasted meats, toasted spice, and chocolate aromas and flavors. A more elegant, polished wine than usual, it already has some up-front appeal. It's going to integrate its oak élevage with 2-4 years of bottle age and should have 10-15 years of prime drinking thereafter. The purity and texture here are spot on. Dark and winey, with delicious waves of cassis, raspberry paste and plum puree coursing through, laced with licorice and tar notes that help extend the finish. Late flashes of singed anise, bitters and wood spice add an alluring echo. Best from 2023. A 60-40 blend of Grenache and Mourvèdre aged in a combination of demi-muids and new barriques, the 2019 Chateauneuf du Pape Renaissance shows plenty of smoky, toasty nuances laid over the top of roasted cherries. Full-bodied, rich and velvety in texture, it finishes long, with overtones of mocha lingering on the finish. It's oaky now, but it should improve with short-term cellaring. Tasted twice (once blind), with consistent notes. Best after 2023 "
1958,Graham's Six Grapes Reserve Ruby Port (375ML,half-bottle),Port,Portugal,14,19.5,4.0,136,"Ripe and opulent plummy fruit on the nose, big and bold. Well extracted deep fruits on the palate framed by well balanced tannins and freshness. The Graham's Six Grapes has always been one of my favorites amongst the reserve Portos. Deep, rich, and satiny, this one drinks smooth and long. I would pair it with more decadent desserts such as dark chocolate mousse or thick mocha cheesecake.

Based on 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Franc brought up in just 45% new French oak, it offers a pure, medium-bodied, ethereal style carrying gorgeous red and black fruits, spring flowers, damp earth, and chocolate aromas and flavors. It's not a blockbuster and is all about purity, finesse, and elegance, yet it still brings beautiful richness and length. This gorgeous, seamless 2019 will drink well for 20-25 years. Best After 2022 Perfumed nose of crushed stones, blackberries and violets. Medium-to full-bodied with very fine tannins and fresh, minerally undertones.

Four hectares on gravel soils adjacent to Trotanoy lend structure, but the 2019 is so polished out of the gates that it might be easy to miss it. Best After 2025 Delivers warm plum sauce and blackberry reduction flavors that cruise through, with a velvety structure and a finish marked by licorice root and anise accents.

Hints of nutmeg. Give it a year or two, but hard to resist. The 2019 Saintayme is just as impressive from bottle as it was from barrel. Rich, deep and explosive, the 2019 offers up an exciting mélange of dark cherry, plum, chocolate, licorice and dark spice. I would cellar the 2019 for at least a few years. This is an especially serious edition of the Saintayme. All the elements are impeccably balanced. Tasted two times. "

Those notions also characterize the smooth, creamy and dry palate where apple mellowness gets the upper hand. A lovely notion of yeast provides an excellent backdrop for the fruit.  "

It’s full-bodied with very ripe, soft tannins that give finesse and polish. Lovely flavors. Eucalyptus, star anise and violet aromas mingle with whiffs of dark spice on this full-bodied red. Concentrated and enveloping, the dense palate offers dried cherry, blackberry jam and ground clove alongside polished tannins the warmth of alcohol. It's already accessible but will also offer several more years of pleasure. This red is marked by new oak, yet has the requisite cherry, strawberry, tar, eucalyptus and iron flavors to match.

Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has ripe, polished tannins, shows the purity of the vintage, and just has loads of character.

Very fun and delicious to drink now, but can hold, too. The flinty and faintly reductive 2020 Isidore Vineyard Maule Valley Semillon is part of what they call Fieldcraft Bottlings, ""wines we make when we see an old vineyard that screams of potential but does not 'fit' into the modern wine trade: too small to fill a truck, too far away from a paved road, too narrow to be worked with a tractor. . ."" Mossman explained a bit more, ""As mainstream wants the small modernize ‘like everybody else’: spray instead of cultivate, scale instead of focus, above all reduce the cost of labour—it’s the labor that unlocks the flavor of the wisdom of farming passed down through the ages. We call this wisdom: fieldcraft."" I was blown away by the 2018, the first vintage of this wine, and the 2019 and 2020 are brilliant too and seem to have different personalities. This is a little rounder and softer, obviously younger and less developed. When I asked him about the vineyard, he said, ""uncertified organic for 60+ years."" Amen. "

Subtle, fruity finish. A pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2014 Alghero Cabernet Riserva Marchese di Villamarina draws on fruit from one of the largest estates in Italy, planted on a flat expanse of land in the island's northwestern Nurra region. This wine historically represents one of Sardinia's premier Cabernet Sauvignons, but the fruit here feels a little under the weather in this humid vintage: The wine starts up with intensity, but ultimately does not go the distance. It shows dark fruit aromas with cassis and myrtle, followed by tobacco, smoke and licorice. This expression ages in equal parts new and neutral oak, and the results are somewhere between mid- and full-bodied, with a finish that is moderate in length. Some 40,000 bottles were made. This is a good near- to medium-term drinking option with a grilled marinated steak. "

As a young wine, the 1996 Ciabot was a symbol of the times. With its bold, racy profile and explosive personality [character], it also encapsulated Domenico Clerico's outgoing personality. Today, at twenty years of age, the 1996 presents the typical flavor profile of a mature Barolo, with plenty of sweet tobacco, leather, mint, dried cherry and rose petal nuances. The new French oak (around 90% at the time) is mostly felt in the wine's tannin profile. Much of the intensity the 1996 showed as a young wine has receded. What remains is a very pretty, expressive Barolo to drink now and over the next few years. Tasted from magnum.

The 2018 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Procès (Domaine) is showing nicely in bottle, mingling aromas of sweet red berries and plums with hints of raw cocoa, smoke and sweet soil tones.

It’s medium-to full-bodied with round and finely velvety tannins and a flavorful finish. So seductive. Drink after 2025. According to Luca Sandrone, his key to success in the hot and dry 2017 vintage was resisting the temptation to pick too early, before the grapes reached optimal phenolic ripeness. While some producers began picking in September, the San- drone team waited until early October, when cooler temperatures refreshed the vines. Le Vigne, a blend of fruit from four communes (Barolo, Castiglione Falletto, Novello and Serralunga d’Alba), indicates that the team’s timing was spot-on. The wine’s rich dark cherry flavors are laced with notes of licorice, carob and warm spice, the flavors gliding on smooth, polished tannins in a long, layered finish. Bright cherry, plum, leather, tar and underbrush flavors are the highlights of this solid red. A firm grip of tannins lines the finish, but not before the fruit builds nicely.

Dark cocoa, blistered berry and charred coffee bean complete the savory show on the palate. "
2101,Moutard Brut Rose de,Cuvaison,Sparkling Rosé,France,44,12,4.3,34,"The NV Brut Rosé de Cuvaison (100% Pinot Noir) is another very pretty wine from Moutard. Rose petal, crushed red berries, mint, dried flowers and kirsch give this beguiling, perfumed Rosé tons of character. There is certainly plenty to like here. This release is 70% 2016 and 30% reserve wines. Dosage is 10 grams per liter. Disgorged: August, 2020. "
2102,Fritz Haag Brauneberger Juffer Sonnenuhr Spatlese,2020,Riesling,Germany,44,7.5,0.0,0,"Very youthful and expressive, with so much mandarin, white peach, nectarine and honeysuckle, this is a beautiful Spätlese, in which the succulent sweetness is beautifully balanced by the lively, lemony acidity.

Laced with light tar, violet and anise notes, showing a pretty twinge of iron throughout as well. Drink now through 2024. A good introduction to the 2020 vintage in the Northern Rhone. Open nose of forest berries with hints of smoke and black pepper. Gentle tannin structure and fresh acidity give this a playful feel. Slightly sappy finish, but there’s enough red-fruit character to carry this. Drink or hold "

2106,Smith and Sheth CRU Wairau Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,Zealand,26,13.5,0.0,0,"The full, round and weighty 2021 Sauvignon Blanc Cru Wairau, while shapely, is well-formed thanks to both texture and tension that runs through the core of the wine, keeping it all reined in. There are pure Sauvignon Blanc flavors, but of the less flamboyant kind: elderflower, nettle, lime and the merest note of flint. A perfumed nose of passion fruit, dragon fruit and banana leaf. Medium- to full-bodied with pleasant mineral notes adding clarity and energy to the tropical fruit palate. Subtle fresh herbs come through. Tasty stuff. Fresh. Drink now. "
2107,Bodegas Raul Perez Castro Candaz Ribeira Sacra Tinto,2020,Mencia,Spain,25,13.5,0.0,0,"The young red 2020 Castro Candaz, from a very warm vintage in Ribeira Sacra, is quite fruit-driven, straightforward and juicy with some fine tannins that would welcome food. It's mostly from Quiroga and fermented in stainless steel and matured in oak foudre. It's Mencía and Bastardo, but in this vintage the Bastardo was very ripe. "
2108,Hunt & Harvest Pinot Noir,2016,Pinot Noir,Oregon,26,13.5,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2016 Hunt & Harvest Pinot Noir is seamless and delectable. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits aromas and flavors of black fruit, chalk, and hints of red fruit in the end. Serve it with lightly grilled salmon fillets.

Drink or hold. Screw cap. "
2110,Le Corti Chianti Classico,2019,Sangiovese,Italy,21,14,0.0,0,"This has a fragrant nose of wild raspberries, rose hips, orange zest, thyme and hints of sandalwood. Zesty and fresh with tight, powdery tannins. Medium body. Vibrant fruit throughout. Camphor, pipe tobacco and ripe black-skinned fruit aromas lift out of the glass along with blue flower. The medium-bodied palate is savory and elegantly structured, delivering ripe Marasca cherry, spiced blackberry, star anise and mocha alongside polished, enveloping tannins. "
2111,Ashbrook Estate Semillon,2020,Semillon,Australia,25,13.5,3.9,16,"This unoaked wine develops its intriguing complexity through a sequence of harvests at the Devitt family’s vineyards in Wilyabrup. The fruit has a firm white-cherry flavor, golden raspberry notes and deeper tones of almonds. The driving acidity informs a texture that would be right at home with grilled abalone. "
2112,Domaine de la Taille Aux Loups Brut,Tradition,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,26,12.5,3.9,26,"Jacky Blot makes this wine from his old-vine fruit that’s not ripe enough to produce his Triple Zéro (recommended above). The rigorous selection of clean grapes and the winemaking process is similar, though this wine rests en tirage for 14 months, and is finished with a minimal dosage (usually about three grams). It has the same pale-limestone direction as Triple Zéro, with honeyed quince scents to fill it out, giving the wine a juicy feel. Refreshing and flavorful, this has a sense of purity that lasts. "
2113,Relic Wine Cellars Scarpa Syrah,2017,Syrah/Shiraz,California,69,14.8,0.0,0,"Coming all from the Phoenix Ranch Vineyard, the 2017 Syrah Scarpa (100% Syrah brought up in two-thirds new French oak) is a beautiful, elegant Syrah that has one foot in Napa and one foot in the Northern Rhône.

2115,Brander F/Red,2019,Other Red Blends,California,18,13.5,0.0,0,"This is a very quaffable and fun table-wine blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 21% Cabernet Franc, 6% Syrah and 1% Malbec. Smoked berry and charred meat aromas meet with a dusting of pepper on the nose. The palate blends smoky and tart red-fruit flavors with fennel and dried herb.  "
2116,Dr. Loosen Erdener Treppchen Riesling Kabinett,2020,Riesling,Germany,28,8.5,0.0,0,"So much lemon and herbal freshness with a touch of licorice. Excellent balance of mineral acidity and delicate fruit on the very lively palate, the grape sweetness barely perceptible. Very crisp, clean finish.
Range: 93-94 This white is driven by a current of acidity, with mineral intensity buffered by peach, apricot and lime flavors. The lingering finish is lined with a salty element. Drink now through 2038. 225 cases imported. "
2117,A. Margaine Extra,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,66,12,0.0,0,"Disgorged in May 2019 with 4.5 grams per liter dosage, the NV Extra-Brut Cuvée M Le Caractère is based on the 2013 vintage and drawn from a solera started in 2002. Offering up delicate aromas of white flowers, walnuts, crisp green apple, fenugreek and nougat, it's medium to full-bodied, pillowy and incisive, with a delicate mousse and a sapid finish. The NV Extra Brut is focused, chiseled and delineated from start to finish. Orchard fruit, citrus and floral notes pulse with energy in this refreshing, vibrant entry-level offering from Margaine. Dosage is 3-5 grams per liter. Disgorged: October, 2019. Made from 100% Chardonnay, the NV Champagne Extra Brut is 80% from the 2018 vintage and the remainder from the 2017, 30% of which was raised in oak barrels. It is a pretty and fresh approach, with key lime, almond croissant, and ripe pear fruit. This translates well to the palate, though it finishes with more pithy citrus and a bit of granular feel that seems to temper its otherwise refreshing appeal. Best after 2023. "
2118,Fratelli Revello Barolo Giachini,2015,Nebbiolo,Italy,71,0,0.0,0,"A very ripe and alluring nose with plenty of sweet-smelling red-cherry and lightly spiced plum aromas on offer. The palate delivers a rich, plush and powerful feel with a bright and alluring middle palate that has fleshy fruit and fine, powdery tannins. Approachable, but also structured to age. This is fruity, expressing cherry and raspberry flavors, augmented by hay, orange peel and tar notes. Fluid and firm, showing fine balance and solid grip on the resonant finish. Best from 2023 through 2040. "
2119,Les Lauzeraies Tavel Rose,2021,Rosé,France,19,13.5,4.1,40,"COMMENTARY: The 2021  Les Lauzeraies Tavel is on point as a rosé from the Rhone Valley. TASTING NOTES: This wine delivers a full-flavored experience with its aromas and flavors of ripe berries and an excellent firmness on the palate. Enjoy it with grilled pork chops. (Tasted: May 23, 2022, San Francisco, CA) This reasonably priced, garnet-hued Tavel highlights mouthwatering blackberry and cassis flavors etched by spicy hints of burnt caramel and anise. Full-bodied and structured by fresh acidity and a kiss of tannins on the finish, it's a lovely year-round rosé to enjoy well through the winter months. A structured rosé, packed with pomegranate and blood orange fruit flavors, which are carried by crunchy acidity and framed by tobacco and hot stone on the finish. Built for food—salmon or even roasted chicken. Delicious. Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault and Mourvèdre. "
2120,Jean-Baptiste Adam Cremant d'Alsace Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,France,24,12,3.8,28,"Creamy, mellow notes of red apple charm the nose. The palate of this wine rounds things out with some brioche notes and a generous mouthfeel of creamy, lively bubbles. The finish is poised, bright and wonderfully apple-fresh in its dryness. "
2121,Terra d'Oro Barbera,2019,Barbera,California,23,14.5,0.0,0,"This full-bodied and moderately tannic wine offers a good, mellow, barrel-aged character along with deep-black-fruit flavors. Hints of anise, clove and cinnamon develop with time in the glass. "
2122,Domaine de Bellene Beaune Les Greves Premier Cru,2018,Pinot Noir,France,129,0,0.0,0,"Pretty floral and Asian style tea influences can be found on the black berry liqueur-suffused nose. There is excellent size, weight and power to the muscular middle weight plus flavors that coat the palate with dry extract on the impressively long though decidedly structured finish where the only reproach is a touch of warmth. Worth checking out. "
2123,Boyer-Martenot Meursault Les Tillets,2018,Chardonnay,France,94,0,0.0,0,
2124,K Vintners The Hidden Syrah,2019,Syrah/Shiraz,Washington,66,14.5,0.0,0,"Ripe black cherry, blackberry and whole and ground peppercorn on the nose. Full-bodied with fine, taught tannins. There is excellent depth and richness here with toasted black fruit and notes of leather and dried rose. Very well balanced with great complexity and intensity. "
2125,The Hilt Vanguard Pinot Noir,2015,Pinot Noir,California,79,14.1,0.0,0,"The 2015 Pinot Noir Vanguard comes from slightly younger vines and see a portion aged in new French oak. It's similarly colored to the Old Guard cuvée but offers more fruit and polish on the nose. Cassis, dried cranberries, dried flowers and hints of mint all emerge from this layered, beautifully concentrated, focused Pinot Noir that's slightly more approachable than the Old Guard cuvée, yet should be just as long lived. It needs 3-5 years of cellaring to show its true potential. Pale to medium ruby-purple colored, the 2015 Pinot Noir Vanguard leaps from the glass with frisky Bing cherries, pomegranate and fresh cranberry notes plus hints of violets, cinnamon stick and fallen leaves. Medium-bodied, the palate gives a great intensity of crunchy, vibrant red berry flavors, framed by lovely ripe, grainy tannins and beautiful freshness, finishing long and perfumed. Deep, hearty and lavish aromas of nutmeg, boysenberry paste, purple flowers and forest floor show on the nose of this bottling by Matt Dees. It is a thick and masculine expression of Pinot Noir, yet is expertly balanced by bright acidity, polished but firm tannins and an earthy sensibility at its core. "
2126,Cortonesi La Mannella Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,70,14.5,0.0,0,"New leather, ripe black-skinned fruit, tobacco and menthol are just some of the aromas you'll find in this delicious red. Full-bodied and elegantly structured, the accessible palate delivers dried cherry, raspberry jam, licorice and a hint of white pepper set against velvety tannins. Drink 2023–2029. The 2017 Brunello di Montalcino La Mannella shows exciting depth, power and length. It stands tall as a fine example of Brunello made in the not-always-easy 2017 vintage. Even its appearance is especially attractive, given its dark but glossy garnet shine. The wine's aromas unwind slowly, starting with dark fruit and plum, but carefully transition to spice, smoke and cedar. There is tension and grip on the finish. Extremely refined and together 2017, with round, fine tannins that show tension and balance. Medium to full body, creamy texture and a delicious finish. Savory and juicy. There's ample fleshiness to the structure of this generous red. Cherry, raspberry, plum, floral and leather flavors ply the rich texture, while dusty, resonant tannins roam the lingering finish. Offers fine succulence and harmony. Best from 2025 through 2042. "
2127,Inglenook Blancaneaux,2020,Rhone White Blends,California,67,14.1,0.0,0,"The latest release of the white wine, the 2020 Blancaneaux boasts greater purity than the 2016, with gentle hints of crushed stone and pencil shavings accenting pear, melon and citrus on the nose. Slightly fuller-bodied as well, it's pleasantly silky in feel, finishing fine and long. Pear and white-peach aromas with some citrus follow through to a full body with layers of fruit and a fresh finish. Mineral undertones. A rather solid and delicious white. Caramelised lemons on the nose, aromas of citrus patisserie. This is rich and bold, not in terms of texture - that is smooth and crisp and lifted, but you can feel the alcohol here and the spice from the wood. It's a little severe and high toned right now, sharp, on the linear, straight side, so you're getting spiced citrus fruit and alcohol. Needs to expand and soften but there's good potential. "
2128,Tatomer Vandenberg Riesling,2019,Riesling,California,27,13.5,0.0,0,"Graham Tatomer is the regional master of Riesling, and this countywide blend is a great entry point. The ocean is ever-present on the nose, with wave-washed aromas of granite, Meyer lemon peel and lemon oil. The palate is focused on dried citrus peel, with a strong sense of fresh sea spray and funky seashore elements, reminiscent of peat. "
2129,Hermann J. Wiemer Semi-Dry Riesling,2020,Riesling,U.S.,21,10.5,4.2,6,"The 2020 Riesling Semi-Dry comes in with 22 grams per liter of residual sugar and 10.5% alcohol. This certainly shows off its sugar in its youth, but it is classically aromatic, fresh and simply delicious. Considering how many round and accessible 2020s I've seen of late, I worried a little as I got to the off-dry categories, fearing that they might be a bit flabby, but if anything, I like this better than the winery's Dry Riesling in this report. It is certainly a nice value in a crowd-pleasing style. We'll see how it ages, but there doesn't appear to be any reason to wait. Best After 2022 "

2132,Stolpman Vineyards Originals Syrah,2019,Syrah/Shiraz,California,42,14,0.0,0,"The 2019 Syrah Originals offers a more cool-climate vibe in its peppery herbs, gamey meat, flowers, and black olive-driven aromatics. It hits the palate with medium to full-bodied richness, ripe tannins, and a great overall amount of texture and richness balanced by good freshness. Made from 100% Syrah that was only 50% destemmed, aged 20 months in neutral oak, this is a classic Ballard Canyon Syrah to enjoy over the coming 7-8 years or so. The 2019 Syrah Originals Estate is scented of red and black currants with touches of cast iron, smoked meat, citrus peel and dried flowers. The palate is chalky, fresh and easy to drink, with iron and game meat accents on the long finish. "
2133,Albert Bichot Chablis Domaine Long Depaquit,2021,Chardonnay,France,41,12.5,0.0,0,"An aromatic wine for a regular Chablis, with plenty of fresh-lemon, white-peach and tarte-au-citron character. Cooler and crisper on the palate than the nose suggested, but that makes it very clean and refreshing. Good length, the finish nicely supported by a touch of tannin. Drink now. "
2134,Chateau Poesia,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,37,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2019 Château Poesia is a charming, up-front, straight-up sexy Saint-Emilion that brings lots of fruit yet always stays balanced and seamless. Bright red and blue berry fruits, spring flowers, tobacco, and some chalky minerality all define the bouquet, and it's medium to full-bodied, with a supple, elegant texture, ripe tannins, and a great finish. This purity of fruit is spot on, and this is another terrific vintage for this château. It already offers pleasure yet will benefit from short-term cellaring and unquestionably evolve for 20-25 years if stored properly. Best After 2024 "
2135,Chateau de Pibarnon Bandol Rose,2021,Rosé,France,43,0,0.0,0,"Light, vivid orange. Mineral-accented citrus pith, red berry and succulent floral and herb scents, along with a spicy topnote. Chewy and sharply focused in the mouth, offering well-concentrated strawberry, bitter cherry, blood orange, honeysuckle and smoky mineral qualities and a deeper suggestion of nectarine. Densely packed, with the mineral and floral notes carrying through a long, precise finish.  A gorgeous, complex rosé, rippling with flavors of cherry, blood orange, spice, potpourri and currant. Ripe, densely packed and creamy, this stays elegant, with impressive harmony and a lovely salted almond note on the long finish. Mourvèdre and Cinsault.  "
2136,Be Human Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,Washington,15,14.5,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 Be Human Cabernet Sauvignon shows an excellent balance of fruit and oak. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits aromas and flavors of black fruit, oak, and savory spices. Enjoy it Memphis-style BBQ ribs. (Tasted: December 7, 2021, San Francisco, CA) "
2137,Dragonette Cellars Rita's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,California,64,14.3,0.0,0,"From a great vineyard in the Sta. Rita Hills, the 2018 Chardonnay Rita's Crown Vineyard just jumps from the glass with exotic notes of spiced citrus, nectarines, flowers, and honeysuckle-like aromas and flavors. It's a rich, beautifully textured, elegant yet concentrated Chardonnay with loads to love. It shows more salinity and minerality with time in the glass and I suspect will evolve for a solid 7-8 years. "
2138,Domaine Camus-Bruchon Pommard Clos des Arvelets Premier Cru,2019,Pinot Noir,France,63,0,0.0,0,"As is typically the case with this wine, it is much cooler and more aromatically restrained than many of the prior wines with its mix of earthy plum and floral scents, all of which is trimmed in just enough wood to mention. There is evident minerality suffusing the vibrant, firm and serious flavors that terminate in an overtly austere but lengthy finish. While this could be approached after 5 to 7 years of cellaring, 10 to 12 is more likely to see it at its apogee. This too is one to consider, provided that you have the necessary patience to wait for it to further develop. "
2139,Chateau de Saint Cosme Gigondas le Poste,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,160,0,0.0,0,"A behemoth of a wine, with dense layers of sweet, ripe plum sauce and mulled cherry that take a dark, savory turn on the palate, coated in melted iron, black licorice, balsamic reduction and singed herbs. Despite its massive power and coiled energy, this is surprisingly delicious now, with beautiful harmony to the texture and structure. A wine to savor and contemplate. Drink now. "
2140,Julien Pilon Lone Condrieu,2019,Viognier,France,64,13,0.0,0,"Alluring, with creamy-textured melon, pear and apricot flavors, infused with subtle almond, orange blossom and anise notes. A subtle mineral edge peeks in, as the lengthy finish plays out. Drink now. "
2141,Los Vascos Cromas Gran Reserva Cabernet Franc,2019,Cabernet Franc,Chile,25,14.5,0.0,0,"Some baked cherries, black pepper and dark spices. A full-bodied and rich cabernet with lots of cassis on the palate. Ripe, tannic and slightly chewy. Give it a year to let the tannin round off. Drink in 2024. "
2142,Le Vigne di Zamo Pinot Grigio Ramato,2020,Pinot Gris/Grigio,Italy,25,13.5,0.0,0,"A pale copper-colored rosé with aromas of fresh plums, strawberries, apples and lemon cream. It’s medium-to full-bodied with a caressing, creamy texture. Smooth and flavorful. "
2143,Chateau Haut-Bailly,2007,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,89,0,0.0,0,"Perfect for drinking now but sure to last for another decade or more. The aromatics of this are just gorgeous, unfurling in the glass to show russet and undergrowth, liquorice, soft black chocolate and savoury but welcoming berry fruit. This 2007 vintage saw a cool summer but a warm September and October, meaning careful work in the vineyard and patience was necessary. Underestimated on release. The wines might not have the structure for long ageing as with 2010 or 2000, but they are blossoming right now, and offer great pleasure; classic balance. Drinking Window 2020 - 2038 Range:  90-92 Shows complex aromas of dark fruits, with bitter chocolate and floral notes. Full-bodied, with pretty, silky tannins. Very well-integrated and long. Builds on the palate. Best after 2013. 5,835 cases made. "

TASTING NOTES: This wine is bold yet sprightly. Pair its robust aromas and flavors of red and black fruit with a lightly-grilled ribeye. (Tasted: April 9, 2019, San Francisco, CA) The black cherry and plum fruit is accented by sandalwood, vanilla and toast aromas and flavors in this silky red. Firms up nicely as this builds to a long, spice- and mineral-inflected aftertaste. Drink now through 2028. "
2146,Casanova di Neri Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,139,15,0.0,0,"This is one of my all-time favorite Brunellos, and although personal tastes are fluid and may change from time to time, there is something timeless and solid about this wine. It's like a touchstone. The Casanova di Neri 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova is graced with a similar interlude of elegant rose or crushed flower that we saw in the annata wine. It appears more prominently here, and with more shape and focused intensity. Make no mistake, Giacomo Neri builds wines for pleasure and sensual impact, and this wine (helped by a hot growing season and 15% alcohol) ticks all those boxes. But it also shows floral elegance and sour cherry freshness that defies our expectations of the vintage. Best after 2024. Tenuta Nuova hails from Casanova di Neri’s Le Cetine vineyard in Montalcino’s south. With a full southern exposure from east to west, it is a sun soaked, Mediterranean expression of Brunello. The 2017 takes a bit of coaxing at first but then cherry bark, cinnamon, liquorice root and gardenia arise from the glass. Upfront, gritty tannins dissolve slowly into a fine dusty powder, revealing supple, round black currants. Citrussy acidity keeps this lively while dark chocolate and mint notes linger.
Drinking Window 2023 - 2029 Expressive, complex and long, despite its compact profile today. Delivers black cherry, blackberry, violet, mineral and tobacco flavors that prevail, while assertive yet refined tannins leave their mark on the lingering finish. Best from 2025. "
2147,Von Buhl Riesling Pechstein Grosses Gewachs,2019,Riesling,Germany,119,12.5,0.0,0,"Quite bold and oaky with plenty of weight and richness, this 2019 riesling GG is on the edge of massive and has a touch of butter-caramel (from malolactic fermentation?) Either you like this style or you don’t, but we find this to be a rather impressive wine. Long, lemony finish. Drink or hold. "
2148,Abacela Fiesta Tempranillo,2019,Tempranillo,Oregon,31,13.8,0.0,0,"Attractive tempranillo with black cherry, crushed stone and purple fruit on the nose. Medium body with bright acidity and lightly chewy tannins. Firm and linear at the end. "
2149,Chateau Les Grands Chenes,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,19,14,0.0,0,"Ripe blackberry and blackcurrant on the nose with cloves, damp earth and a touch of orange zest. It’s medium-bodied with firm, sleek tannins. Lovely precision and evolution with spice and walnut notes coming out on the finish. Try from 2024. Deep garnet-purple in color, the 2018 les Grands Chênes comes bounding out of the glass with exuberant notes of stewed black plums, warm cassis and boysenberries, plus suggestions of pencil shavings, wild sage and crushed rocks. The medium to full-bodied palate is packed with energetic, crunchy black fruits, supported by fine-grained tannins and tons of freshness, finishing with a compelling herbal lift. You feel the warmth of the summer in the texture and the character of the fruit here, but it has been extremely well handled, and there's a sense of lift alongside the Magrez signature glamour. Plush damson fruits demonstrate its ambition and sense of forward motion, with a flourish of oak edging. This takes its time and is chewy on the finish. Harvested 24 September to 11 October. Michel Rolland consults. Readers looking for a delicious, ready-to-go Médoc with classic aromas and flavors as well as medium to full-bodied richness should snatch up bottles of the 2018 Château Les Grands Chênes. Loaded with plenty of darker currant fruits, notes of cedary herbs, and tobacco, ripe, almost sweet tannin's, and outstanding length, it's going to drink nicely for at least 10-12 years. "
2150,J. Lohr Cuvee POM,2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,49,14.9,0.0,0,"Dried dark-berry aromas are wrapped in licorice and oaky spice on the nose of this bottling. Polished tannins and refreshing acidity amplify the dark berry and woody flavors, which have a lot of life left. Inspired by Pomerol, this blend of merlot and malbec possesses a Right Bank elegance. Scents of plum and black cherry have a beguiling over- lay of amaro and five-spice powder. The fla-vors play a tight weave between warm Paso fruit stylings and generous, well-balanced oak. "
2151,Valdo Cuvee 1926 Prosecco,Superiore,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,Italy,24,11.5,3.8,46,"Fresh as a daisy, this blend of 90% Glera and 10% Chardonnay indeed offers up a floral bouquet along with notes of honeydew, white peach, and pear. Though extra-dry with no lack of ripe fruit, it also has the crispness of green apple and lemon plus a touch of salinity. COMMENTARY: The Valdo Cuvée 1926 Valdobbiadene Prosecco delivers an excellent experience on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers steady aromas and flavors of dried orange peel and chalk.

2152,Le Corti Cortevecchia Chianti Classico Riserva,2018,Sangiovese,Italy,31,14.5,0.0,0,"This is layered and very fine-tannined with blackberry and dark-cherry character. Hints of chocolate and hazelnut, too. Medium-to full-bodied with a tight, fresh finish. Aromas of underbrush, ripe black-skinned fruit, violet and eucalyptus lift out of the glass. On the palate, fine-grained tannins accompany dried cherry, raspberry jam and baking spice. Drink through 2028. "
2153,Miraval Rose (1.5 Liter Magnum),2021,Rosé,France,59,13,0.0,0,"Now jointly owned by Brad Pitt and the Stoli Group of vodka fame, this estate is run by the Perrin family of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. This is an impressive rosé, elegant with finely balanced fruit and texture. Citrus and raspberries shine through a taut structure. The aftertaste is crisp and fresh. Drink now. Brandjalina’s provence Rose, super pale in color, juicy and dry, with good acid structure.

2156,Beaumont Chenin Blanc,2020,Chenin Blanc,Africa,23,0,4.0,55,"The 2020 Chenin Blanc has a straightforward nectarine and peach nose, touches of elder flower cordial developing with aeration. The palate is well balanced, taut and linear, with a fine bead of acidity and veins of Golden Delicious apple and yellow plum toward the finish. This is understated but effective. "
2157,El Pino Club The Cusp Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,California,51,14.6,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 El Pino Club, The Cusp Pinot Noir, is enticing and slightly elevated on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of slightly smoked meat, and bright red fruits. Pair it with grilled salmon fillets.

Rich and textured yet also light on its feet, the 2017 is a real winner. The 2017 is just gorgeous. "
2160,Alois Lageder Krafuss Pinot Nero,2018,Pinot Noir,Italy,64,12.5,0.0,0,"Delicate and fine, the Alois Lageder 2018 Pinot Noir Krafuss (now a Vigneti delle Dolomiti IGT wine) is redolent of wild berry, blue flower, crushed stone and orange peel. This wine embraces the subtle side of the grape and produces a lasting sense of balance and freshness. The aromatic intensity of this vintage is perhaps a little undertone and thin compared to recent past vintages (like the excellent 2016 edition that comes to mind); however, the wine has all its elements meticulously in place. "
2161,Hendry Barrel Fermented Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,California,34,14.5,0.0,0,"Aromas of flint, hay and lemon leaf. Medium-to full-bodied with nice balance. Hints of brown butter and almond on the palate. Grapefruit and toasted herbs, too. Drink now. "

2163,Wine & Soul Pintas Character Red,2019,Other Red Blends,Portugal,41,14.5,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Wine & Soul Pintas Character Red Wine impresses with power and style. TASTING NOTES: This wine excels with aromas and flavors of black fruit, earth, and dust. Pair its elegant richness with a slice of rare prime rib. (Tasted: March 22, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The 2019 Pintas Character is a field blend (over 30 grapes, but the majority are Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional) from old vines aged for 18 months in 90% used French oak. As always, the Pintas Character is not quite as powerful or as concentrated as its big brother, Pintas, but this easygoing red has more going on than seems apparent on first pour. Coming back to this after half an hour helped a lot. At that point, it showed off its structure. It features ripe tannins but a firm finish. Then, the fruit also evolved, becoming very expressive. Both approachable and serious, this year's version of Character should age pretty well. It is drinking decently now, but it can still improve over the next few years. It does need to demonstrate it can do that, but it's so appealing today that it's worth leaning up for the moment. Acting as a second wine for the producer’s Pintas, this bottling has a softer aspect at this young stage. It is juicy, with ripe blackberry fruits and good acidity that cuts through the tannins. Drink "
2164,La Pivon Vermouth,Blanco,Vermouth,Spain,29,16,3.6,11,"Fantastically aromatic, made from locally sourced herbs and botanicals in Madrid. Assertive notes of lemon blossom, cedar, orange peel (from Valencia oranges), clove and heather. On the palate, these notes ring true again, with vanilla coming in mid-palate. Lemon reigns on the finish, with a spurt of cinnamon "
2165,Mauritson Rose,2021,Rosé,California,31,12.57,0.0,0,"Pale cherry-pink in color, the 2021 Rosé is dangerously easy to drink! It has scents of red berries, watermelon, citrus peel and dried herbs with a stony undercurrent. The medium-bodied palate balances concentrated fruits and refreshing acidity, and it finishes with a touch of texture that will allow it to more readily pair with food.  Made from 100% Zinfandel, the 2021 Rose is vibrant with white peach, fresh flowers, and tangerine. The palate is dry and refreshing, with grapefruit pith, fresh strawberry, and salty earth. "
2166,Felsina Fontalloro (375ML half-bottle),2018,Sangiovese,Italy,35,14,0.0,0,"A tight, fresh Fontalloro with dark cherry, chocolate and toasted oak. Some walnut, too. It’s full-bodied, yet polished and structured. Sort of shy. But this will develop really nicely with some bottle age. Drink after 2023. To my palate, the 2018 vintage sometimes feels a little too ripe or baked. I was reminded of those characteristics when tasting the Fèlsina 2018 Fontalloro. There is plenty of dark fruit at its core, but this wine also reveals dry tones of jarred oregano, grilled Mediterranean herb, crushed aspirin and graham cracker. The mouthfeel is pleasantly lean and silky, and perhaps the wine delivers more in terms of length than it does weight or texture. A little more bottle age should help flesh out and soften these results. The 2018 Fontalloro is bright, floral and full of energy. In most vintages, Fontalloro is quite open, but the 2018 is especially nervy and taut. That won't be an issue in time, of course, but readers should plan on being patient. Sangiovese is so expressive here. A whole range of floral and savory accents lingers on the close. Forest floor, toasted oak and camphor aromas mingle with dark spice on this 100% Sangiovese. Enveloping and elegantly structured, the savory palate delivers ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, mocha and licorice framed in fine-grained tannins. Fresh acidity keeps it balanced. Best After 2025 "
2167,Penley Estate Tolmer Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,23,14.5,3.7,25,"A deeper style of cabernet with aromas of purple olives, violets, dark roasting herbs and blueberries. This has seen some longer maceration, which drives deeper flavor and more emulsified tannins. Long blueberries and blackcurrants. Smooth, ripe-tannin finish. Drink over the next six years. "
2168,Grgich Hills Estate Sauvignon Blanc (375ML half-bottle),2019,Sauvignon Blanc,California,18,13.5,0.0,0,"The 2019 Fume Blanc Estate delivers fabulously flamboyant scents of pink grapefruit, passion fruit and lime cordial with wafts of lemon blossoms, mandarin peel and struck flint. The medium-bodied palate is packed with pure, zesty, expressive tropical and citrus layers plus tons of minerally accents and herbal sparks lifting the finish. It's irresistibly delicious now, but I'd love to see it with 2-3 years of bottle age too. Aromas of green apple, lemon curd, guava and fresh nettles. It’s medium-bodied and creamy with bright acidity. Refined mineral layers, too, with a focused finish. Solid core of fruit and a firm structure. "
2169,Alois Lageder Terra Alpina Chardonnay Vigneti delle Dolomiti,2021,Chardonnay,Italy,18,12,0.0,0,"Effusive citrus aromas that range from lemon blossom to kumquat, plus a hint of flint. A light and juicy chardonnay with appealing, Alpine freshness. Very clean and harmonious finish. From organically grown grapes. "
2170,Gentilini Robola,2020,Other White Wine,Greece,26,0,0.0,0,"The 2020 Robola is unoaked, very dry (1.9 grams of residual sugar as against seven grams of total acidity) and comes in at 13% alcohol. It was in bottle for about four months when tasted, so there were no issues there. This is the newest release of our trio this issue. Petros Markanatos of the winery says that this was a good vintage, with harvest occurring ""8-10 days later than usual,"" resulting in strong flavors. Concentrated and relatively full-bodied for the brand, this lacks the nuance of the 2016 (or even the 2017) this issue, but it also illustrates how much fun young ones can sometimes be. I'm not so sure this has the structure of the 2016 or the richness of the 2017, but it seems to lean closer to that 2017 in style. Meanwhile, given its youth, it is pure and fruit forward, with a delectable finish. Of course, ""fruit forward"" for Robola still means dry and crisp. There's nothing sweet and simple here. Overall, this looks like it has some promise, but it needs to show good development to go with its early accessibility. It's worth leaning up today. At the moment, it would be my least favorite of this issue's group. It is true that the competition is stiff and this 2020 is young. "
2171,Familia Torres Pazo das Bruxas Albarino,2021,Albarino,Spain,19,12.5,0.0,0,"Nectarine, pomelo and oyster-shell minerality on the nose, followed by a fresh streak of chalky acidity. Bright, yet fleshy on the palate. Drink chilled. "

2173,Domini Veneti La Casetta Valpolicella Ripasso Classico Superiore,2017,Other Red Blends,Italy,23,14,4.2,6,"Aromas of dried cherries, spiced plums, orange zest, cloves, licorice, walnuts and coffee. It’s medium-to full-bodied with firm, sleek tannins. Succulent and rich with layers of dried fruit and spices. Intense and flavorful. "
2174,G.D. Vajra Bricco Delle Viole Barolo,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,119,14.5,0.0,0,"An elegant version, this red features rose, black currant, cherry, mineral and a hint of eucalyptus aromas and flavors. Linear in profile, this is solidly built on a graceful frame, with finely woven tannins and vibrant acidity. The 2018 Barolo Bricco delle Viole is not super intense, but it is balanced in its own way. The wine is subdued but complete with softly yielding tannins to support an elegantly streamlined mouthfeel. Bricco delle Viole is a high and cool growing site in Barolo at 400 to 480 meters in elevation with characteristic Sant'Agata marl soils with fossils. The wine represents a selection of fruit from over seven hectares. With fermentation in steel tank and aging in large Slavonian oak, you are invited to a silky, lifted and beautifully delicate experience with an accessible personality. Intense, flavorful Barolo that shows some good, nutty red-fruit character and fine, firm tannin. Medium-bodied and very tight. "
2175,G.D. Vajra Dolcetto d'Alba Coste and Fossati,2020,Dolcetto,Italy,28,0,0.0,0,"Intense and well defined, exuding black cherry, black currant, violet, freshly ground black pepper and graphite flavors. Dense and concentrated, with a lingering aftertaste. Drink now. "
2176,William Fevre Chablis Vaudesir Grand Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,159,0,0.0,0,"Bursting from the glass with aromas of vine blossom, orange zest, crisp white peach and honeycomb, the 2020 Chablis Grand Cru Vaudésir is medium to full-bodied, satiny and enveloping, with a seamless, elegantly fleshy profile and lively balancing acids. As is often the case, it's one of the more demonstrative grand cru bottlings in the range, yet its track record for longevity is impressive. Lovely intensity, drive, citrus zestiness and energy here. Concentrated and very elegant wine, with a great future ahead. Fine minerality to finish. "
2177,Samuel Billaud Chablis,2020,Chardonnay,France,38,12.5,0.0,0,"From three parcels, one adjacent to Montée de Tonnerre, one by Vaillons and one in Préhy. Restrained and saline, with soft peach fruit on the palate, this has a sharp focus with everything tightly controlled. Refreshing and lip-smacking. The 2020 Chablis Village is a fine effort, delivering aromas of fresh bread, citrus zest, confit lemon, blanched almonds and dried white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, racy and satiny, with lively acids and a long, mineral finish, it's bottled under Diam. "
2178,Poggio San Polo Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,68,14,0.0,0,"A classic, earthy wine, with forest floor and tea leaf savoury elegance. The palate shows outstanding texture, with smooth and complex red fruits with accents of mineral and smoke. The wine is intense, with lovely equilibrium, and offers a very elegant tannin finish. Black currant and cherry flavors mingle in this robust red, with iron, tobacco and wild herbs adding detail. Fresh and juicy, with well-integrated tannins and a lingering finish. "

2180,San Giorgio Ugolforte Brunello di Montalcino,2017,Sangiovese,Italy,63,14,0.0,0,"Lots of ripe plum and fresh flowers on the nose follow through to a full body with layers of fruit and polished yet chewy tannins. Sort of dusty texture. Flavorful and delicious. Transparent. The ColleMassari group took over this property in 2016, with 64 vineyard acres adjacent to the group’s Poggio di Sotto estate in Castelnuovo dell’Abate, in the southeastern sector of Montalcino. This is the first vintage that Federico Staderini and his team controlled from start to finish, aging the wine in 30-hectoliter Slavonian casks instead of the small barrels that had been used in previous years. It unfolds with flavors of black cherry and sour cherry laced with notes of licorice, blood orange and mortared herbs. Tangy acidity propels the flavors as they ride on big, smooth tannins that feel classically powerful. Tightly wound, this red evokes cherry, raspberry, plum, iron and tobacco flavors, with a solid tannic spine giving this support and a firm grip on the lingering finish. Tips a wee bit to the tannins in overall harmony, yet this is complex and long. Best from 2025   The San Giorgio 2017 Brunello di Montalcino Ugolforte (with 30,000 bottles made) is a little subdued when compared to the 2016 vintage, and it delivers broad aromas of plummy dark fruit, spice and crushed roses. The wine is mid-weight in texture, but there is a good amount of power packed within, thanks to the wine's structure and its compact fruit. This opens with aromas recalling dark spice, leather, forest floor and a whiff of coconut. The taut, linear palate starts off with dried cherry, licorice and coffee bean before close-grained tannins jump to the forefront and leave an abrupt, rather astringent finish. Despite the drying tannins, drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit. Drink 2024–2029. Poggio di Sotto’s sister estate, Tenuta San Giorgio was purchased by the Tipa-Bertarelli family in late 2016. As of the 2017 vintage, the two share the same winemaking team with the talented Federico Staderini consulting. This is its usual balsamic self on the nose, with dusty clay and cherry compote joining those classic oily herbs on the palate. At the moment, it demonstrates structure over fruit and the tannins are a tad dry and rustic. Finishes on a tarry, leather note. "
2181,Kumeu River Coddington Chardonnay,2021,Chardonnay,Zealand,60,13.5,0.0,0,"Jazz hands at the ready, the Kumeu River Chardonnay Coddington is always ready to welcome you in with its full, svelte figure and no hard edges, and the 2021 is no different. However, this year there's an additional touch of purpose that keeps it fresh and full of intention. Good depth and weight here, perhaps due to the lower crop after frost made for small yields. There's a sense of feel, a sense of wanting to chew on the finish. Savory characters, festive spices and nutty notes, likely derived from its 25% new oak and time on lees in barrel, join the restrained white stone fruit. "
2182,Valle Reale Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,2021,Montepulciano,Italy,14,13,0.0,0,"Aromas of suede, bright red berries and bark. Medium-bodied with integrated tannins. Fresh. Some citrus character. Tasty. Drink now. "
2183,No Girls La Paciencia Vineyard Grenache,2013,Grenache,Washington,134,0,0.0,0,"Leading off the 2013s from bottle, the 2013 Grenache la Paciencia Vineyard is getting up there with some of the top Grenache releases to come out of the New World. Incredibly perfumed, with notes of herbes de Provence, flowers, dried strawberries and assorted red fruits, it’s medium to full-bodied, seamless and impeccably balanced. The buzz words here are perfume, complexity and elegance. It’s also worth noting that the Grenache vines for this wine come from the famed Rayas lieu-dit in Chateauneuf du Pape. The aromas pop with notes of fresh flowers, smoked meat, stems, mineral, smoke, white pepper and an earthy funk. The flavors dance on the palate, with mouthwatering fruit and savory notes that lead to an outrageously long finish. It's equal parts elegance and intensity. Sleek and polished, with a structured backbone, offering floral raspberry and bacon fat aromas and layered red plum and cracked pepper flavors that linger toward refined tannins. Drink now through 2023. "
2184,Weingut Friedrich Becker Kammerberg Pinot Noir Grosses Gewachs,2017,Pinot Noir,Germany,149,13.5,0.0,0,"Dark, forest-berry character, but also plenty of wild herbs. Stacks of fine-grained tannins, but also joyful and expressive character. Long and generous through the finish, in a slightly robust way that recalls top Pommard wines. Drink or hold. "
2185,Domaine Etienne Sauzet Bourgogne-Hautes Cotes de Beaune Jardin du Calvaire Blanc,2020,Chardonnay,France,57,0,0.0,0,"This has a lovely, lemony fruit with a salty mineral edge, even in a hot year like 2020. A bit more tension, a bit less fat, but very pretty all the same. Just what one wants in a wine like this. This is remarkably good at this level and there's a good bit of it: Sauzet farms 4.8ha in the Hautes-Côtes in the village of Cormont-le-Grand which he calls Jardin du Calvaire. He is next to Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey, who labels it with the name of the valley, called locally 'Bout du Monde' (end of the world). "
2186,Clos Fourtet,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,129,14.5,0.0,0,"Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2018 Clos Fourtet (a blend of 90% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 3% Cabernet Franc) opens with wonderfully pure, intense black fruit notes of ripe blackberries, crushed black cherries and warm plums, leading to suggestions of pencil lead, clove oil, black olives and aniseed. The medium to full-bodied palate is chock-full of muscular black fruits, delivering compelling vivacity and tension, framed by velvety tannin's and finishing epically long and perfumed. The intense, bright, energetic fruit on this 2018 has been impeccably preserved. Stunning! Beautiful all the way, the deep purple hued 2018 Château Clos Fourtet comes from one of the prized terroirs on the upper limestone plateau, just outside the village of Saint-Emilion. The blend is 90% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc, and the balance Cabernet Sauvignon, brought up in 60% new French oak. Gorgeous minerality as well as cassis and ripe black cherry fruits emerge from this full-bodied 2018 that has lots of tobacco and spice-driven aromatics, again, an almost searing minerality, beautiful overall balance, and ripe, building tannins. It benefits from air if opening bottles anytime soon, and it’s going to benefit from 3-5 years of bottle age and cruise for two decades in cold cellars. Beautiful blueberries and black cherries with crushed-stone and limestone notes. Juniper, too. It’s full-bodied, yet so linear and energetic with focused, fine tannins. Fresh acidity. Really fine-grained tannins here. Drink after 2025. Juicy, winey and very compact in feel, with racy acidity and chalky minerality imbedded deeply in the core of sleek cassis, bitter cherry and damson plum flavors. Nice flecks of savory and dried anise dot the finish, where everything echoes nicely. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2024 through 2038. "

2189,Borgo del Tiglio Collio Malvasia,2017,Malvasia,Italy,47,14,0.0,0,"The white-labeled Borgo del Tiglio 2017 Collio Malvasia ushers forth a delicately floral bouquet with white rose, honeysuckle and star jasmine. Any excessive sharpness of those floral fragrances is softened by dusty shades of mineral and crushed sandstone. This is a pretty and delicate wine with the inner texture and fiber of a summer peach, picked straight out of the orchard. I could drink this wine all summer long. About 1,200 bottles were made. "

Reflects the ripeness of the vintage, yet shows energy. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Sangiovese and Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of black plum, mocha and kitchen spice. The structured palate offers prune, roasted coffee bean and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. "
2195,Lanson Le Vintage,2009,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,129,12.5,0.0,0,"From grand and premier cru vineyards, this Champagne comes from a good but not great vintage. That explains its precocious maturity, its fine toastiness and its great balance between a steely texture and nutty flavors. Elegant aromas of baked apples, dried citrus peel, biscuit crunch and some cream. Lovely freshness on the palate, showing a fine mousse. A rich, round Champagne with lots of ripeness and density. Very round and creamy. It’s full and layered with pretty bread dough and softness. Just a hint of freshness at the end. "

Its texture is richly tannic and the mouthfeel is generous, prolonging the lush flavors on the finish. A perennial standout, this wine has proven it can age well. Best after 2025. A selection of Terre Rouge’s best barrels, this syrah ages in mostly new French oak for two years, then in bottle prior to release. That maturation rounds the wine’s tannins and softens the structure a bit while the spiciness continues to drive through a smoky, resinous, almost feral atmosphere of fresh blackberries and black plums. The wine feels cool, even in the presence of its alcohol, ending brisk and zesty "

Full-bodied, rich and concentrated, it's fleshy and muscular, with lively balancing acids and a long, lusty and generously spiced finish. This would work beautifully with rich desserts. "
2204,De Wetshof Lesca Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,Africa,29,14.2,3.5,12,Apple and apricot combine with peach blossom and a touch of honey and toast. Rich and generous with a youthful edge. 
2205,Alain Jaume Domaine du Clos de Sixte Lirac,2018,Rhone Red Blends,France,30,15,0.0,0,"Whispers of smoke and tobacco lend earthen complexities to ripe but pristine blackberry and cherry. It's a bold, voluptuous wine framed in firm, slightly charry tannins but elegant through a long finish. Ready now but should hold well through 2027. "
2206,Rhys Vineyards Home Vineyard Pinot Noir (stained labels),2014,Pinot Noir,California,99,0,0.0,0,"The 2014 Pinot Noir Home Vineyard is one of the most polished, refined wines of the year at Rhys. Sweet floral notes and the 100% whole clusters give the 2014 its aromatic presence, salinity and overall nuance. Sweet red cherry, blood orange and white pepper add life through the mid palate and into the finish. Although the 2014 will be even better with bottle age, its grace and pure refinement are very much evident today. Although young, the 2014 has room to grow. From a hillside site, the backwards, structured 2014 Pinot Noir Home Vineyard offers lots of minerality as well as notes of scrub brush, resinous herbs, spring flowers and assorted red and black fruits. It has serious tannin, yet also beautiful mid-palate depth, purity of fruit and length. Forget bottles for 4-5 years and enjoy over the following decade. "
2207,Arboleda Cabernet Sauvignon,2016,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,25,13.5,3.9,24,"Blackcurrants and fresh herbs such as basil on the nose. Medium body, firm and silky tannins. Subtle complexity. Understated. "
2208,Wolfberger Pinot Blanc,2020,Pinot Blanc,France,22,13,0.0,0,"Playful peach and pear aromas have a savory mineral edge to them. This wine drinks lean and clean, with those fruity notes present and enticing, but held very much in line by bright acidity and a texture that's surprisingly velvety for such a light-bodied sip. The finish is bright and fresh, with hints of white pepper.  "
2209,Zorzal Eggo Franco Cabernet Franc,2017,Cabernet Franc,Argentina,29,13.8,3.4,28,"The 2017 Eggo Franco is pure Cabernet Franc cropped from seven-year-old vines on alluvial soils high in calcium carbonate. It fermented with 10% full clusters in concrete vats, where it matured with the full lees until bottling at the end of the year. It's very varietal, herbal and spicy, with good structure and body, great balance and power, with fine-grained, chalky tannins. Dusty cherry and berry aromas are earthy and highly natural, with no overripe notes or oak. A full, ripe palate offers fine balance between weight and elegance, while this tastes of clean black fruits prior to a finish with dry tannins. This is fresh and exact, with little of the herbal character that often comes with Cabernet Franc. Drink through 2025. "

Here, the site brings a lovely floral perfume to the ripe cherry fruit and a freshness on the palate that keeps the wine dynamic.

2215,Louis Roederer Brut Nature Rose Philippe Starck Label,2015,Sparkling Rosé,France,119,0,0.0,0,"To produce the 2015 Brut Nature Rosé, Lécaillon and his team picked the ripest Pinot Noir in Roederer's holdings in lieu-dit Les Chèvres a week before the rest of their fruit there, macerating it at low temperature for four to five days before adding some 20% of this Pinot Noir to the same base that produces the regular Brut Nature. Delivering aromas of peach, clear honey, freshly baked bread and almond paste, it's medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, with a rich, vinous profile, racy acids and a long, chalky finish. This has always been a structured wine, but in 2015, that structure is cloaked in more flesh and texture.

It comes in with 88 grams per liter of residual sugar and 19.3% alcohol. This was originally seen about three months after bottling. It has settled in a bit, but it still has a long life ahead. Fresh, as always, this also has a beautiful expression of fruit. It is delicious and ripe, with many more years ahead. It isn't drinking too badly now, but of course it has not even begun to acquire complexity. This is a beauty, but its best years are ahead. Beat after 2027. "

So, I tasted the 2014 again but this time labeled as 2014 Finca Martelo. The wine hasn't changed much since the last time I tasted it; it's aromatic and showy, with elegance and poise, nicely balanced and perfumed with a medium body and very fine tannins, intense flavors and a long finish. It's evolving very slowly, and I wouldn't be surprised if it made old bones. 80,000 bottles produced. This rich red delivers a mix of ripe fruit and savory flavors, with cherry, roasted plum, tobacco, loamy earth and spicy character. Well-integrated tannins and balsamic acidity provide focus.

It is dense and layered on the nose, with notes of black cherries, red plums and black tea. The palate takes a spice-laden turn, showing notes of cardamom and anise within a juicy and succulent texture. Despite the ease of drinking it now, this will be a great long-term cellar candidate. Drinking Window 2020 - 2035 This has attractive blueberries and red cherries with light spiced-biscuit complexity.

2223,Domaine Bernard Gripa Saint-Peray Les Figuiers,2019,Rhone White Blends,France,58,0,0.0,0,"The flagship 2019 Saint-Péray Les Figuiers is 60% Roussanne and 40% Marsanne aged in 228-liter oak barrel. It has a terrific bouquet of quince and white currants as well as lots of spice, honeyed toast, and crushed stone. Rich, medium to full-bodied, and nicely balanced, with a great finish, it's another rocking wine from Gripa that readers will love. It will certainly evolve for over a decade. A hint of stuck match appears on the nose of the 2019 Saint Peray Les Figuiers, along with notes of pear and citrus. A barrel-fermented 60-40 blend of Roussanne and Marsanne, it's medium-bodied, streamlined and silky textured, with bright, lime-like flavors on the long finish. Still youthfully tight, this seems like it could drink well for more than the typical 2-3 years. "
2224,Smith Devereux Cabernet Sauvignon,2016,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,54,14.7,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2016 Smith Devereux Limited Release Cabernet Sauvignon is serious, refined, and beautiful.

2230,Zorzal Eggo Blanc de Cal Sauvignon Blanc,2019,Sauvignon Blanc,Argentina,29,13.6,3.4,14,"2019 was cooler than 2018, and the 2019 Eggo Blanc de Cal is even fresher and stonier than the 2018 I tasted last time. This wine is never about the grape variety, and it's like liquid chalk, even more so in 2019. It matured in concrete eggs for 10 months. This is always produced from a limestone-rich plot in the Tupungato Winelands. Half of the wine fermented with the skins, but it doesn't have any ""orange"" characteristics. It's sharp and super tasty. Amazing value.It was bottled in December 2019. The 2019 Sauvignon Blanc EGGO Blanc de Cal from Gualtallary, Uco Valley, was 50% fermented with skins and aged for 10 months in cement eggs. Bright yellow in the glass. The unusual but intriguing herbal nose offers yeast, pastry, fennel and dill. The skinny yet intense palate has well-defined flavors of amaretti and herbs, a low alcohol content (11.5%), a watery feel and precise freshness. Direct and long-lasting, this is a white with a comet-length tail.   Aromas of green mango, dried pineapple, lime zest and yoghurt. It’s medium-to full-bodied with bright acidity. Dense and waxy with a spiced, textured finish. Drink now. "
2231,Selbach Oster Mosel Riesling Feinherb,2020,Riesling,Germany,23,11,0.0,0,"An excellent introduction to the light side of the Mosel, marrying floral, herbal and white-fruit aromas with bright, lemony acidity on the playful palate. Then comes a serious slug of slate character at the crisp finish. "

2233,Vina Zorzal Cuatro del Cuatro,2019,Other Red Wine,Spain,29,14,3.5,21,"The varietal Graciano 2019 Cuatro del Cuatro reflects the warm and healthy vintage with a wine with 13.93% alcohol and a low pH of 3.35 from vineyards in Corella on stony soils. The grapes fermented in stainless steel and the wine matured in 225-, 300- and 500-liter oak barrels for 15 months. This is a very surprising Graciano, full of personality and with a nose that combines herbal freshness and note of wild berries and flowers. This has a lighter color and a lighter body than the majority of Graciano; they say it's the strain they have. But the wine has very good depth and complexity. It's medium-bodied, combining moderate ripeness and vibrant herbal freshness. This is quite open, intense without excess and with some varietal character. Here, they select the grapes they use and the barrels. "
2234,Koyle Gran Reserva Carmenere,2019,Carmenere,Chile,17,14,3.7,19,"I like the varietal character of the 2019 Gran Reserva Carmenere, which is pungent and intense, very aromatic and open. It's a little riper than the 2018 but showing very well. The organically farmed grapes fermented with indigenous yeasts and matured in oak barrels for 14 months. It's medium-bodied and reveals round and polished tannins. Plum, chili and mocha on the nose. It’s full-bodied with chewy tannins. Round and creamy with fresh, leafy character.

2235,Chateau Pesquie Quintessence,2017,Rhone Red Blends,France,24,14.5,3.8,47,"A blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache, the 2017 Ventoux Quintessence offers a complex bouquet of Herbes de Provence, ripe cherries, ground pepper, and orange zest. It's medium-bodied, silky and sexy on the palate, with fine tannin, terrific fruit, and a great, great finish. Drink it any time over the coming decade. The 2017 Ventoux Quintessence turned out a bit disappointing after the performance of the prebottling sample. Dominated by notes of leather, spice and cola, it just seems to lack the freshness I saw the previous year. It's full-bodied and velvety in texture, with plenty of concentration, and should drink well for the next 4-5 years. "
2236,Skyside Cabernet Sauvignon,2017,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,24,14,4.0,111,"COMMENTARY: The 2017 Skyside Cabernet Sauvignon shows the pretty, delectable, and amicable side of the grape variety. TASTING NOTES: This wine is smooth and round. Its aromas and flavors of black fruit, fragrant flowers, and a dusting of earth should pair beautifully with slowly-braised beef short ribs. (Tasted: May 14, 2019, San Francisco, CA) Made by winemaker Anne Dempsey, this new brand from Moët Hennessy Estates & Wines originally hails from the Newton Vineyard estate. Blended with 15% Merlot, 6%Syrah, and 3% Petite Sirah from five counties across the North Coast, it displays dry tannins and Old World acidity.

2243,Donatella Cinelli Colombini Brunello di Montalcino Prime Donne,2016,Sangiovese,Italy,119,14.5,0.0,0,"A complex array of crushed blackberries, cloves, nutmeg and cigar smoke on the nose here. It's full-bodied with firm, intense tannins. Cedar and ripe brambleberries follow through to dark chocolate on the finish. Very complex. Best ever? Opening to a dark color and rich concentration, the Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2016 Brunello di Montalcino Prime Donne (with 6,600 bottles made) shows a lot of fun character. I want to say that the wine is more modern or contemporary in style, but that's not really true. Yes, there's more fruity richness here, but the bouquet is also very vertical in intensity, lifted and bright. There's a fine spot of sweet cheery and tart apple skin. There is no heaviness. The fruit comes from a six-hectare site at a low 225 meters above sea level with medium-rich soils and lots of clay. That richness that I described evidently comes from the site, more than it does the cellar. If you enjoy a softer side to Brunello, you should seek the welcoming comfort of Prime Donne. Violet, underbrush, ripe berry and camphor aromas waft out of the glass on this focused red. It's elegantly structured, featuring juicy morello cherry, cranberry and licorice before a coffee-bean finish. Tightly woven, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity keeps it energized. Best after 2024. Donatella’s all-female project was launched in 1998. Besides the estate’s three winemakers and external consultant, Valérie Lavigne, the Prime Donne bottling calls on the expertise of four other female wine pros, including two Masters of Wine. There is much going on in the 2016 flavour-wise: tea, tobacco, baked fruit and leather pervade throughout. It is quite an extracted Brunello, with gritty tannins that dominate the palate for now. Time will tell how these resolve, but my instinct says enjoy this over the next few years with a grilled steak. "
2244,Domaine de la Janasse Cotes du Rhone Reserve,2018,Rhone Red Blends,France,19,14.5,3.8,23,"A custom blend put together by importer Eric Solomon, the 2018 Côtes Du Rhône Reserve reveals a translucent ruby/purple color as well as classy Provençal notes of black cherries, garrigue, ground pepper, and dried flowers. Medium to full-bodied, elegant, and nicely balanced on the palate, it’s another winner, offering loads of Provençal charm. It’s ideal for enjoying over the coming 3-5 years. A special cuvée for the American importer, Eric Solomon, the 2018 Cotes du Rhone Reserve is a blend of 55% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 10% Carignan and 5% each Cinsault and Mourvèdre from vineyards adjoining the Sabon's Châteauneuf-du-Pape holdings. With its seductive scents of black cherries and raspberries and a smooth, supple mouthfeel, it offers a lovely, medium to full-bodied introduction to the estate's style. "

2250,Purlieu Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,115,0,0.0,0,"Sporting a deep garnet-purple color, the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon comes galloping out of the glass with energetic scents of ripe black cherries, fresh black berries and blackcurrant cordial plus nuances of unsmoked cigars, cedar chest and pencil lead with a waft of wild sage. Full-bodied, rich and decadent in the mouth, the palate is beautifully poised with bags of freshness countering the concentrated flavors and a fine-grained frame, finishing long with a minty kick. The appellation 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley is a beauty and well worth seeking out for those who love up-front, opulent Napa Valley Cabernet. Lots of cassis, blueberries, violets, cedary herbs, and tobacco notes define the bouquet, and it's full-bodied, with a rounded, expansive texture, sweet tannins, and a beautiful finish. Drink this hedonistic, sexy beauty over the coming 10-15 years. "
2251,Jean-Luc Colombo Cornas Les Ruchets,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,France,119,14.5,0.0,0,"This inky, intensely plummy Syrah balances rich, pulsating black-fruit flavors against lip-smacking cassis and accents of tapenade, charcuterie and blood. Sourced from 90-year-old vines and aged 22 months in oak (15% new), the penetrating wine is framed by fine, firm tannins and lingering notes of vanilla, chocolate and earth. Drink 2023–2040. Nicely packed, with a mix of dark currant and blackberry compote notes that are still coiled up, along with bay, dark olive and racy sanguine flavors. Persistent and focused on the finish, with plenty in reserve. Best from 2023. Maybe a touch more concentrated than Colombo's la Louvée bottling but also having a slightly coarser, more open-knit texture, the 2018 Cornas les Ruchets leads off with hints of mint, fennel, crushed stone and blackberries. It's full-bodied and rich, expansive and generous without crossing over into being jammy, with savory notes of black olives and roast meat to balance out the ripe fruit and a lingering, softly tannic finish. Laure Colombo now works with her father, Jean-Luc, to make the wines at this Cornas estate. Les Ruchets remains the family’s flagship wine, from a steep, 5.4-acre plot of 90-year-old vines. She’s kept the house style clean and fruit-forward, working with destemmed berries fermented in stainless-steel tanks, but she’s pulled back on the new oak for aging, so that it’s easier to taste the quality of the fruit on release. That quality is clear in this 2018, which brims with a mix of fruit, florals and herbal notes that makes it feel wild and fresh. The flavors run deep but stay firm, trimmed by fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. As W&S editor Corey Warren said, “it’s complex and convincing right out of the bottle,” and it’s sure to become even more so with time in the cellar. Very deep and intense. Ample blackberry and autumnal hedgerow fruit and creamy, ripe tannins. Powerful and imposing.  "

It comes from a vineyard planted in the 1980s in Pirque at around 700 meters in altitude. They treat this like their other single-vineyard wines, with fermentation in open-top vats with indigenous yeasts and punching down, trying to control the power. They picked this a little earlier and managed to bottle a wine with 14% alcohol and good freshness. 4,071 bottles were filled from 14 barrels in January 2019. This is their 90th wine, marked Lot #90.

2258,Chateau Meyney,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,34,14,0.0,0,"A solid, slightly burly version, featuring streaks of tar and bay leaf mixed with dark plum and black currant preserve flavors. The finish is underscored by a warm paving stone note, which adds cut, drive and a hint of old school. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Best from 2024. Aromas of ripe berries, licorice and chocolate with a touch of mushroom and some dustiness. Silky, polished texture with medium body and firm tannins. Holds long and even, with a lingering sensation of crushed stones. Hold for a couple of years. Second wine of Meyney. Best after 2023. Cassis, currants, ripe tobacco, and cedar pencil notes define the bouquet of the 2019 Château Meyney, a medium to full-bodied, concentrated Saint-Estèphe that shows the elegant, moderately concentrated, yet nicely structured and balanced style of the vintage. It's already accessible with a decant but will benefit from just a handful of years in the cellar and have 15 years or more of longevity. Best After 2022 Aromas of sweet cherries and berries mingled with tobacco, loamy soil and petals introduce the 2019 Meyney, a medium to full-bodied, seamless and lively wine with fine depth at the core, powdery tannins and an attractive sense of completeness. This is an understated but charming Saint-Estèphe that has turned out nicely in bottle. Best After 2025 "

2260,Domaine de Montille Bourgogne Blanc,2019,Chardonnay,France,45,0,0.0,0,"Blessed with notes of ripe orchard fruit and a slightly tropical note. The texture is a bit soft but the finish is satisfyingly long. Produced with fruit from Meursault, Puligny and Chassagne, the grapes are gently pressed and fermented in a combination of large and small casks, with a small percentage of new oak. After a year in cask, they are racked once prior to bottling. "
2261,Lafken Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chile,28,14,0.0,0,"There is very pure varietal expression in the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon, produced with grapes from a single vineyard in Maipo. It's ripe and powerful, with integrated oak after aging in second and third use barrels and a medium to full-bodied palate with abundant tannins. It has elegance and balance. "

It’s medium-bodied with fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Lingering dark-chocolate and toasty notes with dark, earthy undertones. Very refined and poised. Subtle. Drink or hold. From a climat that was largely spared by the hail that impacted this commune, Gouges's 2018 Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Clos des Porrets Saint Georges offers up a generous, youthfully fruit-driven bouquet of plums, raspberries and cassis mingled with subtle hints of cola and creamy new oak. Medium to full-bodied, pure and velvety, it's layered and fleshy, with powdery tannins and an ample core of fruit. This is a rather ripe, sumptuous, even rather heady example of the frequently rather stern Clos des Porrets Saint Georges, and in that respect, it's very typical of the vintage. "
2263,Braida Vigna Senza Nome Moscato d'Asti (375ML half-bottle),2020,Muscat,Italy,12,0,0.0,0,"From an estate vineyard in the village of Mango, this has lovely apricot, pear and flower scents.

2266,Vocoret Chablis,2020,Chardonnay,France,29,12.5,0.0,0,"Domaine Vocoret is a small family estate dating back to 1713. The label proudly states ‘Qualité, Noblesse, Respect du Terroir’.

2267,H. Billiot Fils Brut,Reserve,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,58,12.5,4.0,6,"Reveals ripe cherry and black plum fruit flavors that are well-spiced and married to racy acidity and a fine, chalky texture. Rich hints of smoked almond, candied ginger, honeycomb and verbena gain momentum to linger on the finish. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. A 75-25 blend of pinot noir and chardonnay, like almost all of Billiot’s wines, this does not undergo malolactic conversion, creating a powerfully structured, muscular wine. The fine bubbles add to the briskness of its mouthwatering red fruit, its fruit-skin depth making the finish rich. Pour it with hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar). The NV Champagne Reserve Brut is 75% Pinot Noir and the rest Chardonnay from the 2016, 2017 and 2018 vintages, raised in stainless steel and on lees for 36 months. The nose is pretty and pure, with fresh grapefruit, delicate red berries, and white flowers. The palate is approachable though it has nice tension to it, with orange pith, tangerine, bread dough, and a touch of saline. It cleans up nicely and is a snappy, refreshing style to drink as an aperitif. Drink over the next 10 years. Best after 2022. "
2268,Georges Vernay St Joseph Terres d'Encre,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,France,85,0,0.0,0,"This offers up a refined mix of bitter plum, loganberry and black cherry compote flavors infused with violet, black tea and mesquite hints and carried to a fine-grained, mineral-edged finish. Lovely. Drink now through 2028. 600 cases made, 75 cases imported. Light chicken-stock aromas on the nose, it's meaty but fresh and fragrant. Light- to medium-bodied, very pure and drinkable. Exceptional finesse, light in tannin, but it has structure. Surprisingly long finish. Not as powerful as most Saint-Josephs, I would drink a glass of this on its own, or with lightly-flavoured dishes. Christine Vernay’s St-Joseph comes from 3.5 acres of organically farmed vines on the steep granite slopes of Chavanay. The 2018 is seductively floral and herbal, with scents of rosewater, mint and pink peppercorns that invigorate the purple-plum fruit, keeping it bright and angular, firm and snappy. The flavors deepen and broaden with air, as they will with cellar time, but you could drink this now, with grilled mackerel or a lean cut of beef. Another outstanding wine, the 2018 Saint Joseph Terres D'Encre has a smoky, mineral-laced style carrying lots of blackberry and mulberry fruits, notes of ground pepper, gunflint, and smoke, medium-bodied richness, and polished tannins. This is a classic, mineral-driven Saint Joseph to enjoy over the coming 7-8 years, if not longer. "
2269,Nautilus Clay Hills Pinot Noir,2015,Pinot Noir,Zealand,49,13.5,0.0,0,"Beautifully struck Marlborough pinot with style and grace. This has bright red cherries and spiced strawberries, along with subtle spices and early hints of earthy complexity. But it’s the bright fruit that really impresses on the smooth and succulent palate with fine but assertive tannins. Tidy finish. Minty notes with red fruit nose. Generous, fruity on the palate, with ripe plum and spicy oak flavours and decent weight and intensity. "
2270,Casale del Giglio Mater Matuta Rosso,2016,Syrah/Shiraz,Italy,58,0,0.0,0,"Blueberry, blackberry and cedar aromas with similar flavors on the palate. It’s medium-to full-bodied with juicy fruit and a flavorful finish. Syrah with some petit verdot. Very pretty now. "
2271,Mount Mary Vineyards Triolet,2018,Bordeaux White Blends,Australia,59,0,0.0,0,"This sits on a reductive edge, so give it some good air. It flexes into a minerally, wet-stony mode and has aromas of pear blossom, sliced apple, grassy elements, sliced cucumber and lemon pith. The palate has a very sleek, contained and linear shape with quite intense green-apple and green-pear flavors. Some grassy notes, too. Concentrated and pinned in tight with vibrant acidity. Best from 2024. "
2272,Josko Gravner Venezia Giulia Anfora Ribolla Gialla,2014,Other White Wine,Italy,129,0,0.0,0,"This is a brightly golden, burnished brass hue, with a fragrant supernova of heather, milled white pepper, fennel seed and crushed pine aromatics exploding from the glass. It's firm and chalky in texture on the palate, layering sleek acidity with flavors of dried raspberry and white cherry, iodine, almond skin, chopped rosemary and iron that slowly expand through the long, concentrated finish. Distinctive, this is a gorgeous example of skin contact wine. Drink now. "
2273,Bodegas Izadi Rioja Blanco,2020,Other White Blends,Spain,18,13.5,3.7,6,"Very attractive dried-apple and lemon aromas with some stone and honeysuckle character.

2274,Terroir Sense Fronteres Vertebra,2019,Grenache,Spain,58,13,0.0,0,"A ripe, fruity wine with strawberry and plum character, medium body and round, soft tannins. Lovely texture and richness, but in a delicate way. Luxurious. Drink or hold. The pure Garnacha 2019 Vèrtebra de la Figuera comes from 40- to 80-year-old organically farmed vines in the village of La Figuera at 600 meters in altitude, where the soils are composed of alternate layers of red clay and gypsum. It fermented with indigenous yeasts in concrete, where it matured for six months before bottling. This is quite similar in its aromatic palette to the 2019 Negre, with notes of licorice and Mediterranean herbs and a little more finesse and nuance. This is a little rounder and has a little more ripeness and velvety tannins. This is all about finesse and elegance. "
2275,Pehu-Simonet Face Nord,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,58,12,0.0,0,"Packs a fragrant skein of violet, star anise and graphite that winds through macerated cherry and strawberry fruit, raw almond and crystallized honey. Finely meshed and satiny in texture, this is softly juicy and fresh throughout. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.  Disgorged in November 2019, the latest release of Pehu-Simonet's NV Brut Grand Cru Face Nord is showing nicely, offering up aromas of white flowers and walnuts mingled with hints of orange oil and crisp yellow apple. Medium to full-bodied, fleshy and incisive, with racy acids and chalky grip, it will unwind further with a little time on cork. The NV Champagne Face Nord Brut is 70% Pinot Noir and the rest Chardonnay, with a 2018 base of 70% and the rest reserve wine, that saw 20% barrique aging. The nose is focused with a vinous slanting edge, with iodine, sour red cherry eau de vie, and sea spray. It is inviting on the palate and has a soft mineral texture that is quite attractive and feels weightless. There is a kiss of sweetness from the dosage that balances things out to make for a lovely yet savory aperitif. Best after 2022. "
2276,Stephane Ogier La Rosine Syrah,2016,Syrah/Shiraz,France,41,13,3.8,20,"Peppery and savory elements here with a black-fruit core and moody, graphite-like minerals. The palate has a very plush, supple and dense core of bright, raspberry and strawberry flavors. "

2287,Alain Gras Saint-Romain Rouge,2019,Pinot Noir,France,49,0,0.0,0,"The 2019 Saint-Romain Rouge from Alain Gras was so delicious that it momentarily made the notion of superior Premier or Grand Crus totally redundant! The key is its simplicity. It is disarmingly pretty on the nose with exquisite delineation - vivid red cherries and strawberry. The palate brims with energy, the acidity perfectly judged with a transparent red fruit finish that is so moreish that you will finish a bottle far sooner than intended. Buy-drink-enjoy-repeat. "
2288,Rebholz Pfalz Pinot Noir R,2019,Pinot Noir,Germany,59,13,0.0,0,"This German pinot noir is conventionally beautiful, in the best sense of those words.

Offering up expressive aromas of waxy citrus fruit, pear and nectarine, complemented by hints of freshly baked bread and warm biscuits, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and enveloping, its generous core of fruit girdled by brisk acids and enlivened by a pillowy mousse. Concluding with a chalky finish, this is drinking brilliantly out of the gates but should also age with grace. A leesy, linear version that's chalky in texture, with notes of peach yogurt, almond paste, mandarin orange peel and smoke framed by firm acidity, which nudges this in an austere direction. Pairing this with food would help with balance. Meunier, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. "
2290,Giacomo Mori Chianti,2019,Sangiovese,Italy,24,13.7,4.2,6,"The 2019 Chianti is fabulous. Bright, punchy and full of Sangiovese character, Mori's Chianti pulses with energy from start to finish.

2292,Bodegas Ontanon Gran Reserva,2010,Tempranillo,Spain,50,13,4.4,17,"Spicy red-berry aromas are a bit reedy and piquant, which makes sense when you arrive at a fresh, vibrant palate, with peppy acidity. Plum, raspberry and strawberry flavors are accented by wild herb notes, and only on the finish does this show a riper note of prune and some oak. Aromatic, with sandalwood, tobacco and cedar notes, this polished red delivers cherry, forest floor, vanilla and dried orange flavors. Light tannins and juicy acidity keep this focused. Harmonious.

Yeasty aromas quickly make room for scents of tarte tatin, almond, and ripe Bosc pear, the latter of which carries over to the palate amid the ribbons of lemon zest and oyster-shell minerality that define the finish. A whiff of flint precedes fresh lemon notes that pervade the entire wine with vivid freshness. The palate is taut and bright, with a rather salty, iodine savoriness. Lovely depth from the great proportion of reserve wines. The finish is brisk, with citrus and umami. Apricot, dried apple, dried lemon, shortbread and almond on the nose. Medium-bodied with sharp acidity and fine bubbles on the creamy, biscuity and dry palate. Very fresh and balanced. Drink now This blends pinot noir (45 percent), meunier (22 percent) and chardonnay, creating a round and generous Champagne with a ghosting of red fruit. Those flavors of red apples and strawberries are cut by the wine’s mineral acidity, then they open up again in the finish, lasting on chalk, nuts and crisp fresh fruit. "
2297,Domaine Joseph Voillot Volnay Les Fremiets Premier Cru,2020,Pinot Noir,France,119,0,0.0,0,"This is even spicier with its slightly riper array of red berry coulis, warm earth and discreet anise and tea wisps. The very supple and surprisingly forward medium-bodied flavors immediately firm up on the slightly less mineral-driven flavors that offer a bit better depth and persistence. This will need at least a few years of patience as it's presently pretty tightly wound. "
2298,Dry Creek Vineyard The Mariner,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,50,14.5,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Dry Creek Vineyard Mariner is well-built and finely structured. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers aromas and flavors of black fruit, licorice, and lovely oak accents. Enjoy it with a grilled, well-marbled ribeye. (Tasted: June 21, 2022, San Francisco, CA) Warm, ripe aromas, a full body and moderate tannins give this wine quite a bit of power. Dark chocolate and espresso flavors join very ripe black cherries and blackberries on the rich palate.  This is nicely rendered, with an emphasis on fresh, violet-laced blackberry and black cherry compote flavors that are laced up on the finish with a lively licorice note. There's a subtle cedar twinge at the very end. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. "
2299,Howard Park Leston Shiraz,2016,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,36,14.5,3.6,6,"Deep, shimmering violet. Intensely perfumed cherry, cassis, potpourri and licorice aromas are complemented by smoky minerality and exotic spice nuances. Sappy and seamless in texture, offering bitter cherry and blue fruit flavors that expand and become sweeter with aeration. Shows excellent clarity and finishes impressively long and spicy, with round, even tannins and a lingering suggestion of blueberry preserves.  Leston, in Wilyabrup, is the Burch family’s first vineyard, this shiraz planted between 1998 and 2001 in gravelly loam over clay. Immediately spicy and bold, with some barnyard stink, this wine’s pungent aromas and severe tannins smooth out with air. The flavors deepen as the tannic tension turns toward grace. If you decant this a few hours before grilling lamb, it will be firm, juicy and delicious by dinnertime. Sweet tobacco, spice and plum with nutmeg undertones. Medium body, firm and silky tannins and a flavorful finish. Delicious now. "
2300,Chateau Suau Cotes de Bordeaux,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,19,13,4.1,18,"This smoky wine already shows a fine balance between oak, spice and bright red fruit. It's structured to age but is also attractive now; its juicy berry flavors show easily through the tannins. Drink from 2019. "

2304,Gamble Family Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc,2021,Sauvignon Blanc,California,34,13.4,4.0,6,"Lots of lemon-zest and celery aromas with some crushed stone here, following through to a medium-bodied palate with sliced grapefruit and dried lemon at the end. Fresh and tangy. Grapefruit and tangerine notes appear on the nose of Gamble Family's 2021 Sauvignon Blanc, while the medium-bodied palate is plump and almost creamy in texture, then finishes crisp and clean. Made in predominantly older barrels (70%) and stainless steel (30%), it's a nicely balanced effort that should be enjoyed over the next couple of years. "

It's an intensely mineral wine that balances zesty lime and grapefruit flavors against a smouldering backdrop of earth. Voluminous on the palate and dry in style, it's an elegant, piercing white that should drink beautifully through at least 2030. "

It’s full-bodied with firm, fine-grained tannins. Intense and layered. Good structure, focus and energy. Drink from 2022. The flagship is the 2017 La Haute Cuvée, and it's 95% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot that spent 21 months in 32% new barrels. It has more lifted aromatics of blueberries, candied violets, black cherries, graphite, green tobacco, and cedarwood. This carries to a medium to full-bodied Cabernet that has ripe, polished tannins, good acidity, and a character-filled, complex style that’s going to evolve for over a decade. The 2017 La Haute Cuvée marks the sixth vintage of Hedges Family Estate's first biodynamic wine and consists mostly of Cabernet Sauvignon with 5.26% Merlot. It boasts a dark, juicy fruited frame with a dusty core and elements of savory dried herbs that sway with a soft, oaky essence from the glass. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is focused and pure with a notion of worn leather and dusty lavender, with fine-grained tannins across the mid-palate. The wine ends with a delightful frame of dusty fruit on the finish, with a soft oaky edge that will continue to please for a decade. "
2309,Bodegas Volver Triga,2017,Other Red Blends,Spain,46,0,4.4,5,"The profile of the 2017 Triga is similar to that of its siblings—notes of barbecued meat, fried corn, very ripe and jammy fruit and a lush, decadent mouthfeel with notes of wood and cola nut. It's 16.2% alcohol and is a stereotype of the style. It finishes tannic and astringent. For fans of super ripe, concentrated and oaky reds. It's 85% Monastrell and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, but with the style it has, that's almost irrelevant. "
2310,Relic Wine Cellars Artefact Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,119,0,0.0,0,"The 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Artefact is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon coming from Calistoga. Deep garnet-purple in color, it bursts from the glass with pronounced notes of crème de cassis, plum preserves, wild blueberries and boysenberries with underlying suggestions of cedar chest, menthol, fallen leaves and dusty soil. The palate possesses bags of energy, offering a medium to full-body with layers of bright, bold black fruits and a firm, grainy texture, finishing long and mineral laced. A well-structured cabernet with aromas of blackberries, dried leaves, walnuts, toast and pine cones. Full-bodied yet fresh with fine-grained tannins. Savory, firm and mineral finish. Try after 2022. "
2311,Luigi Baudana Barolo Cerretta,2017,Nebbiolo,Italy,109,15,0.0,0,"This is really perfumed and enticing, offering intense floral and citrus character with some cherry. It’s full-bodied, yet tight and very reserved, with a long, racy finish. Fantastic depth of fruit here. Outstanding purity, too. Better in 2025. This red boasts a beautiful balance between its cherry, strawberry, floral, eucalyptus and mineral aromas and flavors. Supple and elegant, despite the resonant tannins and lively acidity that boost the lingering aftertaste, with fine length. Don’t think about pulling the cork for five years. Forest floor, prune, leather and pipe tobacco aromas make their way to the forefront. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's full-bodied and concentrated, offering cherry marinated in spirits, licorice and the warmth of evident alcohol. Tightly knit, enveloping tannins provide firm, velvety support. Drink 2025–2032. Fresh violet scents lead into flavors of crunchy cherry and seeded blackberry, all layered with notes of bitter chocolate. The wine finishes on lingering notes of warm spice, and its taut tannins will benefit from several years in the cellar. A release of 3,000 bottles, the Luigi Baudana 2017 Barolo Cerretta is the most downplayed of these three wines and the least complicated from an aromatic point of view. A first wave of aromas is focused on wild rose and crushed flowers. More robust tones of ripe cherry, rusty earth and dark spice follow in time. This edition of Cerretta is surprisingly delicate and fine, going against almost everything we know about robust fruit from Serralunga d'Alba and the powerful 2017 vintage. The wine is counterintuitive in a way only Nebbiolo can be. "
2312,Familia Traversa Tannat,2019,Tannat,Uruguay,16,12.5,3.5,6,"Robed in purple fruit, this combines plum and dark raspberry flavors, salty and oceanic in their freshness. Ripe and soft (for tannat), this is a clean red to pour with charcuterie. "
2313,Bodegas y Vinedos Ilurce Rio Mazos Graciano,2017,Other Red Wine,Spain,33,0,0.0,0,"Blackberry and blueberry aromas with hints of lavender.

2314,Domaine du Vieux Telegraphe Chateauneuf-du-Pape La Crau (375ML half-bottle),2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,54,14.5,0.0,0,"If anyone tells you that Châteauneuf is just a big red that’s never elegant, then they need to taste this masterpiece of elegance. So many spicy and savory nuances on the very concentrated but almost perfectly proportioned palate. This is both joyful and serious at the very long, focused finish. Decades of aging potential! Drink or hold. The 2019 Chateauneuf du Pape La Crau is a hugely successful vintage, marked by scents of sun-warmed stones, garrigue, black cherries and black olives. Full-bodied, rich and velvety, it finishes with tremendous length and softly dusty tannins, which should help ensure a long, positive evolution. Saturated ruby. Deep-pitched red/blue fruit liqueur aromas pick up suggestions of licorice, pipe tobacco and pungent flowers and herbs with air. In a lush, weighty style, offering expansive black raspberry, cherry cola, singed plum and fruitcake flavors sharpened by a jolt of spiciness on the back half. For all this wine's richness, it's energetic as well, showing solid, spice- and floral-driven persistence on the finish, which is framed by velvety, even tannins.   The 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape is ruby/purple-hued and has the classic translucent color of the domaine. It's more precise and focused than the Télégramme and will need more time, but it offers a complex, gorgeous bouquet of red and black fruits, crushed stone, wild fennel, and ground pepper. Pure, medium to full-bodied, and elegant, do your best to hide bottles for 5-7 years and it's going to keep for two decades. "

2320,Chateau Beaumont,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,16,13.5,0.0,0,"This is full and plush for an Haut-Medoc with medium to full body. Lots of blackberries and fresh herbs with redcurrants, too. Chewy, but polished. Give it two or three years to soften. Best after 2024. Black cherries, plums, Asian spices, and sandalwood notes all emerge from the 2019 Château Beaumont, a nicely concentrated, medium to full-bodied Haut-Médoc with good depth of fruit and juicy acidity. This château always makes a solid wine, and the 2019 is no exception. "
2321,Faust The Pact,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,129,14.8,0.0,0,"Redcurrants and blackcurrants with some violets and crushed earth. Full-bodied with round, creamy tannins. Fine, velvety tannins that are open and grounded. Firm and tight finish. Drinkable now, but better in 2024. Leads with a bright savory edge, followed quickly by a wave of dark fig, blackberry and açaí berry flavors. Subtle alder and chaparral notes add nice lift through the finish. Best from 2023. Scents of charred wood and scorched coffee mark the nose of Faust's 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon The Pact. Those elements are backed by notes of plum, cassis and blackberries. It's full-bodied and dark-fruited, but there's still a sense of freshness here, expressed in part as a vibrant, mouthwatering finish with soft tannins. "
2322,Domaine de la Janasse Chateauneuf-du-Pape Vieilles Vignes,1995,Rhone Red Blends,France,129,0,0.0,0,"A decent step up over the other two cuvees, the 1995 Chateauneuf du Pape Vieilles Vignes is a complete, full-bodied, layered and balanced wine that’s drinking beautifully. Giving up loads of chocolate-laced dark fruit, cured meats, spice and sweet garrigue, it’s fully mature, yet has the concentration and depth to continue drinking nicely for 3-5 years. "
2323,Giulia Negri Barolo La Tartufaia,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,85,14,0.0,0,"Aromas of toasted nut lead the nose along with underbrush and a whiff of eucalyptus. The linear palate offers sour cherry, vanilla, hazelnut and grilled Porcini alongside close-grained tannins. The Giulia Negri 2018 Barolo La Tartufaia is subdued on first nose with aromas that build slowly. They start off with dark fruit and plum and gradually transition over to toasted spice, tar and asphalt. Its delivery to the palate is thin and polished. "
2324,Steven Kent The Premier Cabernet Sauvignon,2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,125,14.8,0.0,0,"A mint and cinnamon aroma and deep, concentrated, black fruit flavors make a great combo in this moderately tannic, full-bodied and well-balanced wine. Fine grained tannins rope in the exuberant black fruits and oak spices for a fine sense of layering and integration. Best through at least 2028. This very successful producer of Livermore Valley wines scores once again with this full-bodied, reasonably well-balanced, big wine. Its aromas, while still a bit closed-in, smell of ripe currants and notes of black cherry and rich loam in the background. It is supple at entry and fairly mouthfilling in both flavor and texture, yet, at the same time avoids the coarseness that can attend wines of its size. Its concentration shows more clearly on the palate, and the tannins that do extend into the finish call for nothing more than a bit of cellaring. "

This is a terrific Valmur that will merit at least a decade's patience to reveal all its considerable potential. Didier Séguier of William Fèvre says there is a distinct line of Marne soil here, as in Butteaux and Vaulorent. Very precise, showing a touch of orange zest on the palate, all kept in check by vibrant acidity and minerality. A rounded, complete Valmur with a long, saline finish. "
2327,Remelluri Granja Rioja Gran Reserva,2012,Tempranillo,Spain,148,0,0.0,0,"This blends tempranillo (70 percent) and garnacha (25 percent) with a little graciano, creating a light-bodied, finely textured Rioja that seems a bit simple for a gran reserva, though its flavors would come alive in the company of morcilla with white beans.

2328,Domaine Frederic & Celine Gueguen Chablis Vosgros Premier Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,47,12.5,0.0,0,"Initially reductive notes of smoke and gunflint from this youthful bottling fade with aeration, revealing layers of pristine white peach and lime underneath.

2329,Domaine la Consonniere Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2018,Rhone Red Blends,France,47,0,0.0,0,"Made by Sebastien Cuscusa, the 2018 Châteauneuf Du Pape checks in as 80% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre brought up in a mix of concrete tanks and demi-muids. Solid aromatics of red and black fruits, ground pepper, earth, and spring flowers all emerge from the glass and it’s impressive on the palate, with medium to full-bodied richness, a seamless texture, and a great finish. It shows the charming, front-end loaded style of the vintage yet has the balance to evolve for 10-12 years. "
2330,Robert Weil Rheingau Riesling Kabinett,2020,Riesling,Germany,35,9.5,4.4,6,"Striking nose of wild blackberry, melon and mint. Super-energetic and barely off-dry, this is an exciting wine that’s very focused and super-clean. Long, very crisp finish that tingles with minerality. Drink or hold. "

Only 40% of the wine matured in used 500-liter French oak barrels, and the wine is quite fruit-driven, juicy and nicely balanced. It's not terribly complex or deep, but it's very pleasant. "

2336,Racines Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,60,12.8,0.0,0,"Racines is a collaboration between Tyler Winery’s Justin Willett, Domaine de Montille’s Étienne de Montille and Brian Sieve, and Rodolphe Péters of Champagne Pierre Péters, working with entirely Sta. RIta Hills fruit. For the most part, the entire lineup levels-up the intensity and structure of the Tyler wines, as is the case with their Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir. Sourced from multiple sites across the appellation with a backbone of La Encantada Vineyard. Meaty, dense and reminiscent of a damp forest on the nose and palate, with a balanced, dark-fruited, saline-heavy finish. "
2337,Quinta de la Rosa Tawny Port (500ML,bottle),Port,Portugal,17,19.8,4.0,80,"There's lots of hazelnut, spice and dark chocolate in this crisp yet plush tawny, whose lively finish of citrus peel shows hints of smoke. "

It’s full-bodied and layered with a plush texture and a long, flavorful finish. Warm and rather flamboyant for the vintage. Try in 2025. One of the finest vintages I've tasted from this château, the 2019 Château Siran has a great bouquet of ripe black cherries, blackberries, scorched earth, leather, and cedary herbs. With medium to full-bodied richness, polished tannins, and outstanding overall balance, it's going to benefit from 2-4 years of bottle age and drink nicely over the following 10-15 years. It's an impressive Margaux. Best After 2024 Seductive, showing warmed plum and blackberry compote notes that are lush in feel, with pretty violet and anise hints and a flicker of black tea through the finish.

The wine is dark and satisfying, a black robe of fruit cloaking the gentle tannins. There’s black-currant jam and lingonberry flavor in a completely dry, savory structure, giving the wine an austere impression at first. As it settles in, there’s plenty of room for grilled lamb, or coffee-rubbed barbecue. This ruby-colored wine has a nose of brambly berries, thyme and lavender.

Based on the 2018 vintage and disgorged in April 2021, the latest release of Orban's NV Extra-Brut is showing nicely, bursting with aromas of pear, white currants, fresh mint and yellow plums.

Drink 2013-2017. Complex nose of walnuts, dried stone fruit and leather, followed by a salty tang on the palate and a creamy finish. An essential Palo Cortado, from a solera established in 1790, this holds to the drier side of the style. It seems to have absorbed all the limestone of the albariza soil of Jerez, presenting it with a mineral austerity that is saline to the extreme. However, it also carries a few drops of sweetness, a touch of gentleness that will make it a fine bridge to the juicy, dark meat of roasted game birds. Very racy, with an intense ginger, green tea and bitter almond core that stretches out, with mouthwatering acidity and serious cut. A long echo of dried orange peel runs through the finish. "

There is a lot of extra ripeness that is delivered amply across the wine's dark fruit flavors and its soft textural richness. Nero d'Avola is planted across three hectares in reddish sandy soils. Like other wines from this vintage, it delivers a front-loaded effect.

2420,Zuccardi Finca Los Membrillos,2016,Cabernet Sauvignon,Argentina,129,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2014 and 2015 vintages were not produced, because they were difficult years for the grape, so I tasted the 2016 Finca Los Membrillos, a single-vineyard pure Cabernet Sauvignon that was last bottled in 2013. It comes from a vineyard planted with a massal selection of the grapes that they bought. In 2016, they did a selection of two kinds of soils (in this case, the shallower soils because of the cooler and wetter year), then this was fermented in concrete and matured in oak barrels. These Cab grapes were picked in between picking Malbec grapes, which is not like it was done in the past, when Cab grapes were kept for last, and if you left them too late, they dried out and became very tannic. I think this wine transcends the varietal; yes, there are some spicy and peppery notes and it's balsamic, but it's mostly stony/chalky. It has fine-grained, chalky tannins, typical of the variety and the Altamira soils. This is serious, balanced and has good aging potential in one of the finest (if not the finest) vintages. This is a pure cabernet sauvignon with green olives, hints of tobacco and currants. Green cedar, too. Medium to full body, round and chewy tannins and a flavorful finish. "

Black cherry, spice, menthol, licorice, chocolate and lavender all open in the glass. This deep, fleshy red packs plenty of punch. I find this to be a bit heavy for a Grenache-based wine. The 2018 Rodney's Vineyard Revelation is 54% Grenache and 46% Syrah, all destemmed, and aged 20 months in 43% new French oak. It shows the purity of the vintage and has a clean, elegant, medium-bodied style as well as ample kirsch and blackberry fruit, notes of peppery herbs and flower, a good spine of acidity, and outstanding length.

At least some patience is advised for this youthfully austere effort. Beautiful lemony fruit, with mineral notes and bright aromas of acacia flowers. On the palate the texture is silky and lively, but there is a pleasant creamy edge to give balance. First-rate Chardonnay. This cuvée is a blend of many parcels over 9.5ha. The grapes were picked at 13% potential alcohol and fermented in stainless steel tanks, with a large percentage of the lees to give it more body - more were used in 2020 than ever before. After fermentation, the wine was aged in used tanks.

Its textures are like pure silk, energized by zesty acidity and becoming quite spicy over time, as tart cherry-berry flavors and saline-minerals saturate deeply. Grippy tannins come forward through the licorice-tinged finale as this tapers off slightly structured, almost salty and remarkably fresh. The 2017 possesses all of the traits of a classic Voliero Brunello, and it’s only in the slightly gruff tannins that you find any mark of the warm, dry vintage. This is exceptional.

2476,Llopart Original 1887 Gran Reserva Brut,2010,Vintage Sparkling Wine,Spain,89,11.8,0.0,0,"Now with the Cava de Paraje seal, the 2010 Original 1887 Gran Reserva Brut Nature celebrates the original coupage of the first Llopart wine produced in 1887. A blend of 50% of the Parellada strain known locally as Montonega with 25% each Xarello and Macabeo, it matured in bottle in contact with the lees for at least 80 months. I found very good complexity and balance between younger characteristics and more developed aromas and flavors, with very good freshness and overall harmony. It has some yeasty and balsamic notes, hints of camphor and still a touch of waxy apples. I like the dry finish and the focus the absence of sugar seems to provide. I find this perfect for current drinking. The Llopart family blend this wine from the fruit of the oldest vines in Les Flandes, a north-facing amphitheater at an elevation of 1,250 feet. Half of the wine is montònega,a pink-skinned phenotype of parellada, from vines planted in 1935; the balance is equal parts xarel-lo (planted in 1934) and macabeo (planted in 1956). That fruit comes together in a smooth, succulent sparkler, integrating honeysuckle, nectarine, foresty Mediterranean spice and an edge of minerality. It’s a complex wine, made for shellfish, whether freshly shucked clams or grilled oysters. "
2477,David Arthur Chardonnay,2020,Chardonnay,California,89,0,0.0,0,"A steely and flinty chardonnay with aromas and flavors of sliced apples and pears and some cream. Medium body. Lovely soft texture, yet bright and beautiful. The finish is intense and flavorful. Minerally. Some solid phenolic tension. Oak Knoll sourced grapes. "
2478,Alvaro Palacios Finca Dofi Priorat,2020,Grenache,Spain,115,14.5,0.0,0,"The single-vineyard 2020 Finca Dofí comes from the 14 hectares of vines planted across three parajes (lieu-dits) in Gratallops, a blend of 83% Garnacha, 12% Cariñena, 4% Picapoll—a grape with low sugar and high acidity (good for climate change) that he regrafted some four years ago—and 1% white grapes: Garnacha Blanca and Macabeo, all fermented in oak vats with 10% full clusters and indigenous yeasts and matured in large oak barrels (bocoyes and foudres) for 15 months.

Lenoble Blanc de Noirs Premier Cru Extra Brut,2013,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,89,12.5,0.0,0,"From the village of Bisseuil, east of Épernay, this Pinot Noir is tightly structured and richly fruity. Its low dosage emphasizes the Champagne's red-apple fruitiness while also opening space for the taut texture and fine acidity. A little young, this vintage wine will be best from 2022.

There is a delicious surge of raspberry and ripe redcurrant, fine boned and persistent. Lovely. Once again there is just enough wood to merit pointing out framing the ripe but cool dark berry, plum and dried herb aromas. The much earthier medium-bodied flavors possess excellent intensity and a certain taut muscularity on the youthfully austere, focused and relatively powerful finish. This well-made and firmly structured effort is going to require at least some patience. "
2482,Teso la Monja Victorino,2019,Tempranillo,Spain,79,0,0.0,0,"Jumping up in price, the 2019 Victorino offers more finesse and elegance, with medium to full-bodied aromas and flavors of cassis, black raspberries, spicy oak, and chocolate. It's rich and concentrated, with ripe, velvety tannins and a great finish. It's another pleasure-bent, impeccably made wine in the lineup that I'd certainly be thrilled to drink. The 2019 Victorino was selected from 45- to 100-year-old vines in La Jara and El Palo (Toro), El Rosal and El Risco in Villabuena del Puente and in Valdefinjas (35 hectares) that yielded 21 hectoliters per hectare, quite low. It had a traditional vinification of destemmed grapes with yeasts selected from their own vineyards with malolactic and 20 months of aging in 100% new French oak barrels. This is still very young and marked by the toast from the barrels, smoky and spicy and with ripe and juicy fruit, creamy, very round and with silky tannins, the signature of the vintage. It's tasty and has a clean and defined finish. Very 2019. Gorgeous blackberries and blueberries with some violets. Medium to full body with firm, silky tannins and a long, polished finish. Focused and refined. Extremely silky for Toro. Drink or hold. Offers licorice, cigar box and tar accents on the nose that lead to flavors of black raspberry and boysenberry coulis on the palate. Fine tannins provide grip and tension, firming the finish. "

Clean-cut and minerally on the finish. Drink now  Still young, this vintage Champagne is packed with highlights of minerality, taut white fruits and shots of citrus. Tightly textured, the wine will benefit from some more aging. Drink from 2022. The 2017 Brut Blanc de Blancs is bright and focused, with lovely persistence and energy throughout. Lemon peel, white flowers, mint and white pepper all grace this taut, mid-weight Blanc de Blancs from Deutz. Drink it over the next handful of years. "
2484,Domaine Claude Dugat Bourgogne Rouge,2020,Pinot Noir,France,94,0,0.0,0,"This provides an exceptional entry point to the range, with a rich, voluptuous cherry fruit character and a dense, focused feel on the palate. Approachable now, this definitely has the substance for mid-term ageing. Produced from one hectare of vines, all of them located in the commune of Gevrey, three-quarters in Genevrières. In 2020 the harvest started on the 22nd August and finished before the end of the month out of a concern for the acidity. There was significant concentration of the fruit, and yield from some parcels was down by 40%. "
2485,Erath Willakia Vineyard Pinot Noir,2014,Pinot Noir,Oregon,60,13.5,0.0,0,"This shows dried flowers, lemon rind, strawberries and hints of cedar. The palate is delicate with a good backbone of acidity, velvety tannins and a clean finish "
2486,Domaine La Barroche Chateauneuf-du-Pape Julien Barrot,2020,Rhone Red Blends,France,64,14.5,0.0,0,"I was able to taste two releases from Julien Barrot. Looking first at his 2020 Châteauneuf Du Pape Cuvée Julien Barrot, which is a blend of 60% Grenache, 19% Mourvedre, 13% Syrah, and a handful of other varieties, it sports a deeper purple hue to go with a fabulous bouquet of kirsch and blackberry fruits as well as licorice, crushed stone, licorice, and ground pepper. It shines for its balance and elegance on the palate, but still brings substantial fruit as well as structure. A tasting of two foudres and a cement tank that make the body of the blend point to a precise and fine style of this cuvée in 2020. A little lighter than usual, but enjoyably fresh and slender, with relatively modest levels of alcohol. The Mourvèdre was particularly good here in 2020. "
2487,Smith and Sheth CRU Heretaunga Chardonnay,2017,Chardonnay,Zealand,50,13.2,0.0,0,"This is a modern, finely structured Chardonnay laced with peach and orange Creamsicle, white spice, floral and reductive notes like nuts and smoke.

(Tasted: March 8, 2021, San Francisco, CA) The 2017 Cru Heretaunga Chardonnay is awfully similar to how I remember the 2016, boasting layers of grilled white peaches and nectarines on the nose. On the palate, it's medium-bodied and nicely rounded, with a generous, silky-custardy texture and lingering notes of ripe citrus and charred oak on the finish. "

The wine opens to pretty aromas of wild cherry, rose, blood orange and iron ore. Winemaking starts with stainless steel and concludes with 10 months in French oak. The vines are planted in clay soils, and when you study the bouquet in depth, you do perceive a tad more structure and concentration as a result. "
2492,Quinta da Muradella Alanda Blanco,2017,Other White Blends,Spain,44,13,4.3,19,"The 2017 Alanda Blanco is a white blend from a very challenging year when most of the crop was lost to frost. It was kept in tank for 12 months. This is the only white he produced in 2017, using grapes from all the vineyards, whatever he could save, mostly from younger vines and even some second flowering grapes. It has some herbal aromas, bay leaf and fennel, and is still a little closed, as it was only bottled a couple of months ago and should take a few months to settle in the bottle. This is quite remarkable for what it is; it keeps the profile of the whites from the house and is quite fresh for such a weird vintage, with more dry extract from tiny yields and small grapes. It does have flavors, so some grapes managed to ripen. A great effort for the year. "
2493,Bodegas Muga Flor de Muga Blanco,2018,Other White Blends,Spain,50,13.5,3.7,13,"Like they did with the Rosado a few years ago, there is now a top-of-the-range white. The 2018 Flor de Muga Blanco was produced with a blend of 40% Viura from red limestone and clay soils, 30% Garnacha Blanca from classical clay and limestone and 30% Maturana Blanca planted on sandy soils. They selected the free run must after a short maceration in the press and fermented it in small oak vats (there's no stainless steel at Muga) at low temperature. The wine was then kept with fine lees in concrete eggs for three months, during which time they expected it to fix aromas and provide some volume, and then it was aged in lightly toasted new French oak barrels for six months. The wine has been kept in bottle for 18 months. A subtle and complex white with sliced-peach, apple and vanilla-pod aromas and flavors. It’s medium-bodied with a solid core of fruit and hints of toasted oak. It’s tight, very subtle and reserved. Blend of macabeo, white maturana and white garnacha. The 2018 Flor de Muga Blanco checks in as equal parts Viura, Malvasía Riojana, and Garnacha Blanca. It reveals a medium gold hue as well as a richer, spicy, subtly oaked bouquet of orchard and citrus fruits, green almond, and chalky minerality. This beauty is medium-bodied, has good mid-palate concentration, bright acidity, and a great finish. I wouldn't be surprised to see it have an interesting evolution over the coming decade or more. An elegant white that layers lightly mouthwatering acidity and a delicate, chalky base note with flavors of yellow pear and plum fruit, salted almond, preserved lemon and a flash of beeswax. Creamy finish. Viura, Garnacha Blanca and Maturana Blanca. Drink now. "

2495,Grgich Hills Estate Rose,2021,Rosé,California,31,13.1,3.9,5,"This may be the most unexpected wine we found in our tastings this spring - a bright, flavorful Napa Valley Rosé, refreshing in its pink-grapefruit and yuzu flavors, substantial in its cool depth and delicate green citrus notes. A compelling rosé, it demands your attention and rewards it, but doesn’t require it. From five organically farmed estate vineyards throughout Napa Valley, this blend is based on Cabernet Sauvignon (56 percent), plus Zinfandel, Merlot, Franc, Petit Verdot, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling. The wine gains its color through several hours of skin contact, the free-run juice building substantial flavor
through a long, cool fermentation. It would be easy to drink a lot of this, whether before dinner this summer, or with sushi this fall. "

This wine shows impeccable aromatic integration with the high notes and the baritone notes delivered in beautiful synchronization. This wine outpaced my initial expectations following my first tasting of this vintage from barrel. The tannins are integrated and there is a sweet, fruity note on the full-bodied close. This has an aromatic array of ripe red and black cherries, blackcurrants, blueberries, cloves, cedar, fresh herbs and licorice. It’s full-bodied, incredibly smooth and polished with layers of ripe fruit and chocolate, yet with lifting freshness. Fine, silky tannins and a long finish. Lingering chocolate and spices.

Vibrant and balanced, with a fine citrus aftertaste. Drink now. This too is firmly reduced and in need of a thorough aeration. The dense, powerful and tautly muscular flavors coat the palate with dry extract while the intensely saline-inflected finish is very dry, youthfully austere and impressively long.

On the palate, it's medium-bodied, with bright acids that lend the wine focus and delineation, with good concentration and a chalky, mouthwatering finish. The additional tension and intensity that this possesses over the Alesia Anderson Valley bottling—also derived from Bearwallow Vineyard—reflects how selective, both at the press and in the cellar, the Rhys team is in determining what makes the cut. Follow it for the coming decade or more. Starting with the Chardonnays, the 2016 Chardonnay Bearwallow Vineyard comes from Anderson Valley and offers a medium-bodied, fresh, elegant, almost feminine profile as well as classy citrus zest, crushed rocks, and white flowers.

This fermented with indigenous yeasts in small oak vats followed by one year in oak foudres. It's only 13% alcohol and has soft acidity. For Pablo Eguzkiza, this wine is always different; it has more tension and is subtler, more serious, very long and with finesse, a more refined version of As Caborcas. This is their highest-altitude vineyard and the one they harvest last. The wine has restraint and complexity, the combination of old vines and a long cycle even in an early year like 2017.

Very good balance at the long, polished finish. Drink now. This is the estate's entry-level Sauvignon Blanc that boasts a fresh and snappy style. This is my first time tasing this wine. The Nals Margreid 2021 Alto Adige Sauvignon Stein only sees stainless steel, and the fruit is harvested from young vines, aged five to 10 years old. The vineyards are in the village of Nalles at 330 to 400 meters above sea level, and if you look beyond the church steeple, virtually the whole face of the mountain is planted to Sauvignon Blanc. This expression is not too nervous or wound up. It delivers an informal drinking style with good freshness and a salty mineral close. Best After 2022.

The 2019 Garnacha CDVIN is 100% Garnacha from a single vineyard planted in 1923. It has an interesting bouquet of cherry, mulberry, and plum-like fruits as well as spring flowers, toasted spices, chalky minerality, and just a hint of iron. All about finesse and elegance on the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, has a supple, elegant mouthfeel, great tannins, and a great finish. The balance and texture here are truly something, and this is straight-up gorgeous Garnacha. It needs a decant if drinking any time soon and should evolve gracefully for 10-15 years. Best After 2022 Eduardo Eguren makes this wine from a parcel of 100-year-old vines in the hills of Alto Najerilla. Tasted blind, the wine brings to mind forest strawberries, the warmth of its alcohol cooled, as if by a woodland breeze. The fruit’s purity is impressive, as is its freshness—two of the best kinds of ambition for garnacha. There is a new village Garnacha from Cordovín, but because his winery is in San Vicente de la Sonsierra, he cannot use the name the village of Cordovín. So, he has resorted to labeling it as 2019 Garnacha CDVIN, an absurd last resort due to an absurd limitation in the regulations that I hope will be fixed sooner rather than later. It's produced with grapes from centenary vines in Cordovín and Baldarán on red silt and clay soils with alabaster and gypsum, fermented destemmed and matured in 500-liter barrels for 14 months. It's darker and riper than the 2020 I tasted next to it, with black rather than red fruit, 14% alcohol and a round and juicy palate where the tannins are fine and the finish fresh and long. Best After 2022 "

2587,Terrabianca Campaccio (375ML half-bottle),2016,Tuscan Blends,Italy,24,13.5,3.9,8,"Aromas of violets and lavender on the nose. Hints of rosemary. Crushed berries. Medium to full body. Firm tannins with hints of wood. Needs time to come together. Very pretty. Drink after 2020. The 2016 Campaccio is clearly a wine from a previous era at the estate. Ample and rich in feel, the 2016 powers through with copious black plum, chocolate, mocha and sweet oak. There is plenty of depth, but the 2016 also feels a bit heavy. Even so, the 2016 is nicely done in its style. It will be interesting to see what the new owners do with their flagship Sangiovese/Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot blend. "

2598,Joseph Swan Trenton Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir,2015,Pinot Noir,California,79,12.7,0.0,0,"Moving to the two 2015s releases, the 2015 Pinot Noir Trenton Estate is one of the darker hued releases in the lineup and it has a bright ruby/purple hue with almost no amber at the rim. Seeing around 30% stems and 15 months in 60% new French oak, it has a wonderful bouquet of black raspberries, dark cherries, tobacco, California bay, and chocolatey spice. This carries to a medium to full-bodied Pinot Noir with a silky, seamless texture, polished tannins, nicely integrated acidity, and a great finish. I love the complexity here as well as the vibrancy in the fruit, and I think this is a small step up over the 2013. Mouthfilling and crunchy flavors of cherry, plum, currant and raspberry are well-integrated and backed by lively acidity. The finish is filled with spice and mineral accents. The 2015 Pinot Noir Trenton Estate Vineyard has mature aromas of dried red and black fruits with notes of mushroom, damp earth, potpourri and mossy bark.

2613,An Approach to Relaxation Sucette Grenache,2017,Grenache,Australia,58,14.5,0.0,0,"The cool, late-ripening 2017 season played right into the hands of Carla Rzeszewski and Richard Betts, the sommelier power-couple behind An Approach to Relaxation. That was the year they purchased a 12-acre parcel of dry-farmed grenache vines, mostly planted between 1860 and 1880, growing in the deep sands of Vine Vale. The vines had contributed fruit to Sucette’s 2016 vintage, and provided more than half of the 2017 (by 2019, Sucette was entirely from that estate parcel). They make the wine half a mile away, fermenting it with some whole clusters in open-top vats, then aging it in old French oak barrels. Open the bottle and pour a glass: You’ll get a blast of peppery grenache, the bright sunlight stored in the fruit immediately released. It might be worth the price of admission if the wine went south then and there, but that sunny energy and the sand-driven tannins only gain dynamism with air; the delicate strawberry, the darker black raspberry depths, the lavender fragrance and unreal length of flavor make the wine compellingly drinkable for days. A Barossa classic reimagined (think Robert O’Callaghan’s great Dry-Grown Grenache vintages at Rockford Basket Press), this is a wine that has held fast in my memory for weeks after tasting it. The only downside in buying a case is the separation anxiety you are likely to feel on opening the last bottle, and the cravings that may come after finishing it. The medium-ruby 2017 Sucette is another fine example of sand-grown Barossa Valley Grenache. Boasting seductive, rose-like aromas, hints of five-spice powder and a deep base of cherry fruit, it's supremely silky in texture, gently filling the mouth with gossamer goodness, then slowly fading into lingering notes of cracked pepper, star anise and even a bit of ginger. While not overly tannic, it's concentrated and balanced, with the potential to drink well for at least 5-7 years. Shimmering ruby. Vibrant, sharply focused red fruit and floral scents are complicated by peppery spice, botanical herb and smoky mineral notes. Juicy and energetic on the palate, showing strong, spicy lift to its intense raspberry, cherry, lavender pastille and spice cake flavors, which deepen with air. Finishes sweet, seamless and impressively long, with polished tannins adding shape and gentle grip. "

2616,Tenuta di Valgiano Palistorti Rosso,2020,Other Red Blends,Italy,35,13.5,0.0,0,"Lots of blackberry, licorice and clove aromas follow through to a medium to full body, tight and slightly austere tannins (in a good way) and a fresh, vivid finish.

2624,Tapiz Alta Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,Argentina,19,14.1,0.0,0,"The varietal and medicinal 2019 Alta Collection Chardonnay comes from San Pablo and has the freshness of the high altitude and cool zone. It was produced in a traditional (oxidative) way, but they have reduced the percentage of new oak and moved to 500-liter barrels, so the oak is subtler. The wine has balsamic flavors with a touch of herbs and dry flowers and the subdued minerality from the soils. It's fresh even after 100% malolactic. "

It fermented in 10,000-liter vats with indigenous yeasts and matured in used French oak barrels of different sizes for nine months. It's herbal and vibrant, with pungent aromas of bay leaf, spicy and very tasty. This strain of Graciano seems to deliver less color and body, and the wine shows it. This is medium-bodied and has very fine tannins, pungent acidity and a long and tasty finish. The herbs turning more into flowers with time in the glass... Another bargain. "

Pelagrilli has a beautifully soft and open-knit character, and the tannins are well managed to show no rough edges or bitterness. What stands out best in this wine is the sheer density. Built like a tank, it will embrace long cellar aging. This is taut and chewy, with beefy tannins putting a strong grip on the black cherry, plum, earth and spice flavors. Feels more fruity than savory, ending with assertive tannins. Best from 2025. "
2639,Patrick Piuze Chablis Roncieres Premier Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,79,12.5,0.0,0,"This silky, vibrant white is all about texture and harmony, showcasing peach, melon, apple and lemon fruit underscored by a subtle minerality. Seamless from start to finish, ending in a long, citrusy and stony aftertaste. From a parcel that seems to do especially well in warm vintages, perhaps because the vines are planted east to west, so its grapes are never exposed to direct sunlight, Piuze's 2020 Chablis 1er Cru Les Roncières wafts from the glass with aromas of pear, freshly baked bread, white currants, beeswax and pastry cream. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and racy, with bright acids and a charming core of fruit, it concludes with a long, mineral finish. "
2640,Inglenook Rutherford Sauvignon Blanc,2019,Sauvignon Blanc,California,34,13.5,0.0,0,"Composed of 76% Sauvignon Blanc and 24% Semillon, the 2019 Sauvignon Blanc offers intense notes of struck match, lemon tart and green apples, plus hints of white peaches and elderflower.

2641,Weingut Spreitzer Rosengarten Riesling Grosses Gewachs,2019,Riesling,Germany,69,0,0.0,0,"Anyone who thinks that dry riesling is unremittingly hard and austere should try this joyful wine.

Pinot Noir), Zweigelt and St. Laurent. Predominantly based on the 2018 harvest, the wine has a bright salmon color and opens with a clear and intense yet pure and very elegant bouquet of red fruit aromas with floral as well as whole-grain bread notes. Round and intense on the palate, this is a mouth-filling, rich and fruity but pure, fresh and elegant, well-structured and saline-finishing rosé Brut that doesn't taste as light as the stated alcohol volume of 11.5% might persuade, but it reflects the 2018 vintage on a very high level. Best after 2022. "

2651,Pegaso Granito,2018,Grenache,Spain,69,14.5,0.0,0,"It's always interesting to compare the 2018 Pegaso Granito from the one produced with grapes from schist-rich soils, especially when they are from one of the finest vintages in Gredos in recent times. It fermented in stainless steel and oak vats with indigenous yeasts and matured in 500- and 600-liter French oak barrels for 18 months. This has very good ripeness but without excess and is a little closed and austere. It has the cold sensation of the granite. It's very balanced and should develop nicely in bottle. This is one step up from the previous years. "

I love its overall balance, it has nicely integrated acidity as well as impressive purity in its cassis and dark berry fruits, and it’s going to drink nicely right out of the gate yet also evolve for over a decade. This is an estate readers need to seek out. Lovely lavender and dried herbs on the nose and palate. Shot through with saturated fine tannin and juicy blackberry acidity. Plenty of detail, personality, power, freshness and great balance, this is a really satisfying glass of Crozes-Hermitage. The 2020 Crozes Hermitage immediately conjures visions of a wild blackberry thicket—slightly green, prickly, yet brimming with sweet fruit.

The 2013 Terra Gratia is soft, plush and inviting. Dark red fruit, spice and sweet floral notes give the 2013 its aromatic lift and brightness.

In 2018, the Cabernet emphasizes fruit density and power, while the savory notes that are typical of this site are nearly buried. Blueberry, tobacco, licorice, smoke, incense and leather open with some coaxing, but the 2018 needs at least a few years in bottle. Beautiful cassis, blackcurrants, tobacco, and sandalwood notions emerge from the 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon Star Lane Vineyard, and it’s medium-bodied, with a wonderful sense of elegance, silky tannins, and outstanding length. A classy, impeccably balanced Cabernet Sauvignon that shows the style of quality of this estate, it’s going to keep for 15+ years. The blend is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% each of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, 4% Merlot, and the balance Malbec, all aged 22 months in 35% new French oak. "

Presents a core of juicy apricot, black cherry preserve and huckleberry notes that are concentrated and have terrific purity, with dried herb and floral accents. The exuberant finish features notes of black tea and spice. Drink now through 2040.

This has a good, gutsy feel, with juicy and still slightly compact plum, raspberry and blackberry fruit flavors taking the lead, while licorice root, apple wood and dried garrigue hints fill in as well.

2688,Smith Woodhouse Vintage Port,2016,Port,Portugal,79,20,4.1,8,"A serious Port in the making, loaded for bear with dark currant paste, warmed
fig sauce and blackberry reduction flavors pouring through. The brambly grip
is deeply embedded and there are gorgeous ganache and licorice snap notes
hanging on the finish. Best from 2035 through 2055 This is extremely floral with dark fruit and plum character. Full-bodied, very tight and focused. It's a complete young vintage Port that is great from start to finish. Rio Torto fruit makes this great! Better in 2022. Full
and rich, the wine has dark tannins and
dense blackberry flavors. It is generous wine—juicy,
perfumed and layered with impressive tannins. This
is a wine with a long-term future, drink from 2028. The 2016 Vintage Port is an equal blend of old vines and Touriga Franca, coming in with 113 grams per liter of residual sugar. Fresher, livelier and lusher than the Warre's this issue—which is the most accessible of the Symington declarations—it is also going to be approachable relatively young. This is a fine Port, but it's not truly made for greatness. If it is not quite as rich and decadent as Warre's, it is more lifted on the finish, with a sunny feel and a more aromatic beginning. I liked them about equally well, but the styles are certainly different. Neither may be the best agers. "

The wine is modern and soft, showing lots of contained ripeness and creaminess, yet it successfully embraces the fundamentals of the appellation and Sangiovese, thanks to its bright acidity and finely tuned structure. Few wines reach this level of precision, especially in a challenging vintage such as this. To the northwest of Montalcino, Castello Romitorio’s vineyards are surrounded by thick woods receiving moderate sun exposure. The relatively cool setting was an advantage in 2017. Well put together with a graceful flow, this Brunello echoes its setting and opens with pronounced cedar and evocative forest floor accents. Neither heavy nor over-concentrated, the palate is replete with pulpy red berries. There is a succulence to the fruit and a silkiness to the texture, and nuances of pulverised stone weave throughout.

2695,Husch Dry Gewurztraminer,2021,Gewurztraminer,California,17,13.9,0.0,0,"Geared a bit more to the flowery, jasmine-like aromatics of its variety than it is to intense spice yet still hinting at scattered notes of ginger throughout that mark it indelibly as Gewürztraminer, Husch’s 2021 bottling is a fairly deep and continuously wellfocused, carefully balanced dry working that shows a nice bit of food-worthy finishing grip. A wine that would earn enthusiastic recommendation even if costing considerably more, it comes at a surprisingly modest price that makes it all the easier to like. "
2696,Maison Chanzy Rully En Rosey Rouge,2019,Pinot Noir,France,33,13.5,0.0,0,"Spicy and rooty with delicate red berry fruit, then ample fine tannins on the velvety mid-weight palate, here is a serious wine for this moderately priced appellation. Long, crisp finish with a touch of minerality. "

Elegant and fresh. Drink now. "
2699,Ernest Vineyards The Wrangler Pinot Noir,2018,Pinot Noir,California,63,12.3,0.0,0,"The 2018 Pinot Noir The Wrangler Grand Vent Vineyard is a fabulous wine that captures all of the elements that make the Ernest wines so appealing. A burst of sweet red berry fruit, sage, orange peel and mint give the 2018 its effusive aromatics and breadth. Vivid, translucent and exceptionally beautiful, the 2018 has a lot to offer.

2703,Domaine de Villaine Bourgogne Rouge La Fortune,2020,Pinot Noir,France,59,14,0.0,0,"This Bourgogne shows why the Cote Chalonnais is underrated.

Drink or hold. The 2020 Herrenberg GG is clear deep and aromatic on the nose that intermingles pineapple and richer slate aromas on an elegant and generous but refined and slightly flinty nose. On the palate, this is a rich and elegant, juicy-textured and stimulating salty Herrenberg with a fine tannin structure and dry finish. Not as filigreed and aristocratic as the Abstberg but with more fruit and sensuality. "
2705,CARO Aruma Malbec,2020,Malbec,Argentina,17,14.5,3.8,6,"Blackberries, dark spices and cloves. A hint of iodine, too. Ripe blackberries on the palate with a broad, dense tannin frame.

Drink from 2023 The 2020 Malbec Aruma comes from different vineyards in the Uco Valley, Mendoza and spent a year in fine lees. This vintage delivers remarkably intense, fruity notes of candied plum, violets and a pure, alluring bed of herbs. Harsh in the mouth, the juice of the region combines with the 2020 climate to energize a palate of potent but balanced alcohol. This is a big but nuanced red.   "

the dry Moscatel from Málaga, and it now features an old retro image.
The wine was cropped from an atypical year with good spring rain and
cooler temperatures that resulted in a late harvest that started on the 26th
of August. It's a good year for dry wines, as the grapes didn't suffer the
summer heat like in other occasions, and the grapes ripened slowly,
developing full aromas and flavors. It has character and is more herbal
(nettles, recently cut grass) than floral, more fruit-driven, juicy and tasty,
with moderate acidity. It has a different personality. This was bottled
unoaked. "
2722,Yealands Estate Single Vineyard Pinot Noir,2019,Pinot Noir,Zealand,32,13,3.1,12,"COMMENTARY: The 2019 Yealands Single Vineyard Pinot Noir is a slam down, delicious wine. It is rich, satisfying, and lasting into its excellent finish. TASTING NOTES: This wine brings a show of bold, ripe fruit and loads of berry notes in its aromas and flavors. Pair it with a slow-roasted leg of lamb topped with a mint and rosemary jelly. (Tasted: February 6, 2020, San Francisco, CA) This has some more complex style than the other Yealands 2019, packed with blueberry and violet aromas, some blood orange, as well as toasty and spicy oak. The palate has a plush, easygoing feel and holds smooth, fleshy dark-cherry flavor. Drink now. Screw cap. From a warm vintage, the Awatere-sourced 2019 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir seems to have benefited, as it doesn't show much of the region's typical green edge. On the nose, black cherries accented by hints of cola and spice abound, while the medium-bodied palate is concentrated and silky-textured, with a gently tannic finish that should support at least a few years of aging.

Vivid purple in color, displaying complex, layered aromas of sour cherry, strawberry, licorice and a whiff of blood, the expression is open and profound. In the mouth, this is terse with fresh tension and good fat, breadth and energy. A wine of volume, texture, and long-lasting flavor, it’s liquid proof that Cinsault can be a serious wine. "
2725,Barnaut Blanc de Noirs,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,62,12.5,0.0,0,"The NV Brut Grande Réserve Héritage Familial is an absolutely gorgeous Champagne that captures the natural resonance and breadth of Bouzy, all in a vinous, creamy style that is so appealing. Orchard fruit, spice, tangerine oil and warm, toasty notes all build effortlessly in the glass. The Grande Réserve Héritage Familial is two-thirds Pinot Noir and one-third Chardonnay. Coming from the grand cru village of Bouzy, with its reputation for powerful Pinot Noir, this Champagne has something of that concentration, but balances that with elegance, freshness and plenty of crisp acidity. Its fruitiness, laced with minerality, makes for a wine that is ready to drink. Disgorged in September 2019, Barnaut's NV Brut Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru reveals aromas of smoky pear, waxy citrus rind and toasted bread. Medium to full-bodied, with a fleshy core of fruit, lively acids and a youthfully frothy mousse, it's a touch less concentrated than the 2017 disgorgement, but it's a pretty Blanc de Noirs. "
2726,Penfolds Max's Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,Australia,25,13,3.5,40,"From 1948 to 1975, Max Schubert gained global recognition for Penfolds while serving as its winemaker. This tribute to him in the form of a French oak–aged Chardonnay has aromas of cashew brittle, baked apple, and lemon blossom. High levels of brightness show on the palate with lime zest and white cake. Marvelous acidity keeps it fresh. In typical Penfolds style, this is a glossy Chardonnay, with balance, finesse and nary a hair out of place. Lifted aromas of pineapple rind, grapefruit, white flower blossoms and flint morph towards cashew and toasted brioche as the wine warms in glass. It’s slick in texture, with a lovely line of acidity. The oak is present but supportive. A saline note lingers on the finish. Drink now "

It's very lightly wooded, with 70% of the total fermented in stainless steel. Balanced, spicy and mineral-edged. Attractive aromas of dried and caramelized pears, plus a kiss of vanilla oak, making this ripe and generous Bourgogne blanc easy to enjoy. The finish has nice freshness that pulls you back for more. Drink or hold. "
2728,Bodegas Tradicion Palo Cortado,VORS,Sherry,Spain,109,19.5,4.5,6,"Tradición has built a strong reputation as caretaker of some of the region’s most unusual old wines. This Palo Cortado, for example, comes from wines an average of 32 years old, in an oxidative process that seems to have removed everything superfluous, leaving only the essentials. It smells and tastes of sea breezes and albariza soil as white as chalk. Intense and slightly spicy, it attacks the palate with its vibrant acidity, the firm texture filled out with notes of nuts and green olives. Open the bottle to drink it over the course of a month, or maybe a year. Keep it in a cool, dark place and see what wonders oxygen will bring. A stylish palo cortado, with orange blossom, dried nectarine, green tea, ginger and date notes threaded with a subtle iodine edge through the finish. Rather high-toned, but this dances along beautifully. The N.V. Palo Cortado is a V.O.R.S. 32 years of age. Medium amber-colored, it has an exceptional bouquet of nuts, apricots, and marmalade. Intense and smooth textured, it has exceptional length. "
2729,Finca Villacreces Ribera del Duero,2016,Tempranillo,Spain,45,14.2,3.7,19,"A red that offers a wealth of plum, chocolate and walnut character. Smoky with redwood undertones. Full body, chewy tannins and a flavorful finish. Needs time to soften. Try after 2022. The 2016 Finca Villacreces was produced to showcase the essence of the estate, mixing grapes from different soils fermented and aged separately and then blended into a combination of 88% Tempranillo, 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Merlot that fermented in concrete and oak vats and matured in 225- and 500-liter French oak barrels for 15 months. I was expecting more freshness here, but I found ripe black fruit and something earthy/organic reminiscent of peat and coal, plenty of fine-grained tannins and ripe and earthy flavors. It's still quite oaky. Surprisingly enough, the 2017 showed better... 71,242 bottles and 535 magnums produced. It was bottled in July 2018. "
2730,CR Graybehl Mathis Vineyard Grenache,2016,Grenache,California,37,14.6,0.0,0,"Blackcurrant tart, blueberry purée, sandalwood and spices. Medium to full body, succulent tannins and a round, spicy finish. "
2731,Hess Collection Panthera Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,California,45,14.6,0.0,0,"Sweet chamomile, honeysuckle and peach on the nose. Full-bodied. Stony on the palate. Pleasantly bitter towards the end with some brown butter, too. Good complexity and balance. This is a hearty, rich wine in style, with luscious flavors of baked apple, pear and pineapple. The oak is generous and spiced in nutmeg, with a touch of vanilla and caramel. From the Russian River Valley, the 2019 Chardonnay Panthera offers a vibrant, up-front bouquet of ripe peach, melon, honeysuckle, and spicy oak. It's rich, medium-bodied, has plenty of fruit and texture, and outstanding length. "
2732,Joseph Drouhin Cote de Beaune Blanc,2018,Chardonnay,France,61,13,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 Joseph Drouhin Côte de Beaune Blanc is slightly elevated on the palate and lasting in the finish.

2733,Bovio Barolo Gattera,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,68,15,0.0,0,"The 2018 Barolo Gattera is another expression from La Morra with soft tannins and a very silky texture. Gattera is characterized by bright fruit tones, cassis and dried raspberry. You might also recognize powdered licorice and pressed blue flower. There is a hint of cherry sweetness on the close, and Gattera offers a little more tannic structure and firmness. This is very tight just now, with a compact bead of red fruit, nutty spice and dried flowers running through the wine. Medium-bodied with firm tannins and a tight, savory finish. Excellent promise, but wait for it to open and expand. Try from 2024. Fermented with indigenous yeasts at controlled temperature for at least 10 days, then macerated on the skins for 3-4 weeks using the submerged cap technique, Bovio's Gattera is finished with 24 months of ageing in Slavonian oak. A quintessentially traditional Barolo from an austere MGA, its earthiness is a signature. Slightly garnet in the glass, its smoky woodland aromas shine, with earthy strawberry and rhubarb fruits. The fruit is vibrant on the palate with a dried cherry flavour, good acidity and great intensity. Silky at first, it has a velvety mid-palate with a dusty finish. Its slight lightness of concentration is typical of this vintage. A frank interpretation. "
2734,Bonaccorsi Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir,2016,Pinot Noir,California,49,13.7,0.0,0,"The pale garnet colored 2016 Pinot Noir John Sebastiano Vineyard offers aromas of lilac and violet to begin, segueing to notes of tree bark, amaro, red berries, blueberries and perfumed earth—this has lots of delicate layers. It's nuanced but concentrated in the mouth, with a light to medium weight, fine-grained tannins and great freshness, finishing long and layered. Destemmed and aged all in neutral barrels, the 2016 Pinot Noir Sebastiano comes from a windy site located on the eastern end of the Sta. Rita Hills. It's a more reserved, closed wine now yet offers plenty of hefty dark fruits, earth, and underbrush aromas as well as a medium to full-bodied, textured style on the palate. Some coaxing gets you more fruit and underbrush, but it's best left in the cellar for another 2-3 years. "
2735,Villa Creek Avenger,2019,Rhone Red Blends,California,64,14.9,0.0,0,"Offers torque and structure combined with deep currant, licorice and peppered beef accents, which gather tension toward medium-grained tannins. Syrah, Graciano, Carignan, Grenache and Mourvèdre. Drink now. "
2736,Julien Pilon Cornas L'Elegance du Caillou,2018,Syrah/Shiraz,France,69,0,0.0,0,"Quite a plush version by Cornas standards, with waves of juicy plum and blackberry compote rolling through backed by typical lavender, rosemary and bay accents that emerge steadily through the racy, iron-tinged finish.

2740,Domaine Bruno Clavelier Vosne-Romanee Les Hautes Maizieres Vieilles Vignes,2018,Pinot Noir,France,119,0,0.0,0,
2741,Herdade do Mouchao Tinto,2013,Alicante Bouschet,Portugal,59,0,0.0,0,"From this large region’s most historic estate, 70% of the blend is Alicante Bouschet, showing exotically spicy black fruit aromas leading to structure and depth on the palate, great individuality, and freshness and acidity for the long term. Excellent. Drinking Window 2018 - 2030. The Reynolds family released their first bottling from their Mouchão estate in 1949, and it soon became a legendary wine in Portugal. The family had come to the Alentejo in the 1800s, as part of the cork trade, and settled on a ranch northeast of Estremoz, eventually planting vines in the 1870s when some professors from Montpellier traveled to the region with cuttings of a recent cross, alicante bouschet. This blend is a selection of the top parcels of alicante bouschet, and includes about 15 percent trincadeira, the grapes fermented in stone lagars, the wine aged in old wooden vats for three years, then another two in bottle prior to release. It starts out as a narrow, tense wine with a cool, spicy bite to the finish. Then it keeps developing over the course of hours and days, the wine’s alcohol completely incorporated into floral blueberry flavors, its youth showing in bright notes of bee pollen, more August than September or October. As it gains some fat and turns silken, the wine shows what it will become with another five to ten years in bottle. The 2013 Tinto, the regular estate bottling, is a 76/24 blend of Alicante Bouschet and Trincadeira. It was aged for 36 months in used 5,000-liter tonels of varying ages and comes in at 14% alcohol. Still elegant, this has fleshed out a bit and certainly doesn't seem thin. It does many other things brilliantly, though. Alternating silk and velvet for texture, it is simply sensual, and caressing on the palate. The nuanced finish with waves of beefy Alicante adds complexity. This is also a little restrained—the tannins are moderate, but they certainly increase with air. You can drink this now, but it should still improve and will steadily get better. This is lovely. I'm not convinced it is a truly great one yet, at least in the context of this winery's history. "
2742,Saggi,2018,Other Red Blends,Washington,61,14.8,0.0,0,"There are only a few Sangiovese-dominated wines from Washington, but they tend to be rock-solid. The 2018 Saggi Red Wine is a great example, revealing a ruby/semi-translucent color as well as notes of ripe cherries, leafy herbs, sandalwood, and dried flowers. Medium to full-bodied, it has plenty of richness, velvety tannins, and outstanding length. It opens up nicely with time in the glass and should have 10-12 years of longevity. "
2743,Meyer-Fonne Pfoeller Riesling,2018,Riesling,France,49,0,0.0,0,"Green apple and lime are countered by faint earthiness on the nose of this wine. On the palate, bright, juicy green apple and spritely acidity are the name of the game, while some petrol notes come through on the long finish. It will be interesting to see what this wine does in the next year or two.  "
2744,Scala Dei Priorat Prior,2017,Other Red Blends,Spain,61,14.5,3.8,12,"A solid red with medium chewy tannins and berry, bark and black-tea undertones. Medium to full body and a flavorful finish. Plenty of character here. "

2817,Chambers Rosewood Rutherglen Grand Muscat (375ML,half-bottle),Other Dessert,Australia,100,19,0.0,0,"This is a beautiful fortified, composed of solera wines going back a staggering 120 years. Espresso colored, it exudes dried fig, praline, butterscotch, smoke and mocha aromas. The palate is intensely sweet, with a lick of alcohol heat, but with beautiful freshness to buoy the dried orange, fig and toffee flavors, which linger long on the endless finish. Savor with a caramel-and fruitbased dessert. The olive rim to a walnut-brown heart of the colour sets the scene; the heady essence of raisin bouquet pushes any discussions of the fortifying spirit to the back row; in its place there is an Arabian bazaar of spices, with a nod to Turkish baklava, then a rolling wave of Christmas pudding with a garnish of dark chocolate and caramelised roast nuts. The ultimate magic of the Chambers wines lies in the freshness of the finish. With a medium brown color going slightly green at the edge, NV Rosewood Vineyards Grand Muscat has aromas of macerated sultanas, fig paste, baklava, toasted hazelnuts and coffee grounds plus a little mace. The palate is very sweet and very crisp with an unctuous silkiness that blankets the mouth and lingers a very long time. Toasted hazelnut, salted caramel and dark chocolate–covered coffee bean flavors are bold and intense, set on a smooth and silky frame, but with plenty of freshness to stand up to the sweetness. Spice and tobacco notes linger. Drink now through 2028. "

2819,Zilliken Forstmeister Geltz Rausch Riesling Kabinett,2020,Riesling,Germany,38,8.5,0.0,0,"Some will say that this is “only” a kabinett, but it’s also a very serious wine with considerable depth and many subtle nuances. An amazing range of aromas, from lilac to passion fruit. Near-perfect balance of racy acidity and delicate grape sweetness. Pristine finish. Drink or hold. "

It has aromas of licorice and Mediterranean herbs. It has character and is light and ethereal, in the direction of the 2018, with fine-grained tannins and a stony sensation in the mouthfeel. This is incredible; it has 12.5% alcohol and is fluid, fresh and incredibly easy to drink. This is young but very approachable. Really perfumed and beautiful with lots of bright fruit and spices. Lots of lavender, too. It’s full-bodied with creamy tannins. Delicious finish. Drink or hold. "

Drink now through 2033. This is a hefty wine at the moment, opening with notes of raspberry chocolate, currant, licorice, mint, tomato leaf and oak spice.

2832,Ronchi Barbaresco,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,39,14,0.0,0,"The 2018 Barbaresco is a classy wine from Ronchi. The Barbarescos here are often a bit fruitier than this. Overall, the 2018 is an attractive wine that looks like it will age relatively quickly. All that said, the balance is impeccable. Crushed flowers, leaves, mint, tobacco and leather add layers of nuance. This is an especially floral, aromatic vintage for the straight Barbaresco. "

Its lighter gold hue gives way to a salty, vibrant, mineral-laced, and medium-bodied Chardonnay with bright citrus and lemon fruits, nicely integrated acidity, good overall balance, and classy spice and chalky mineral nuances. It's going to benefit from a year in bottle and keep for 7-8. It's not your classic Russian River Chardonnay and reminds me more of a seaside, Sonoma Coast release. It's beautifully done. "

A delicious wine, with 19% alcohol and high acidity, this is one of the driest styles of fortified wine. It serves up a bounty of warm and enticing aromas—dried earth, tangy mineral, roasted nuts—and fills the palate with an attractive lushness. Pair with Marcona almonds, hard cheeses, and olives. (Tasted: November 10, 2016, San Francisco, CA) Offering up high-toned aromas of dried dates, beeswax furniture polish, cane sugar and dried fruits, the latest release of Broadbent's NV Sercial Ten Year Old is medium to full-bodied, racy and enveloping, with tangy acids, a sweet and fleshy core and a long, penetrating finish.

2843,Chateau de Bligny Blanc de,Blancs,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,65,12,4.1,15,"This wine’s aroma is broad and classical, with a Cognac-like barrel-scent. The wood spice continues through the flavors, as does a pure chardonnay fruit character of floral pear. It’s toasty and sophisticated, following a crisp line of flowers and herbs. Serve it with whole fish roasted in a wood oven. The minerality of this pure Chardonnay shows how close the Côte des Bar is to the vineyards of Chablis. It has a chalky texture as well as ripeness, a crisp and structured wine. This bottling is a little young and will repay waiting few months, so drink from late 2017. A hint of toasty brioche adds subtle richness to aromatic notes of white peach, yellow apple, mandarin orange and ground spices in this juicy Champagne, which has a delicate finish. "
2844,Nomine Renard Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,France,55,12.5,4.7,11,"Peach pit, rhubarb pie, candied pomegranate and strawberry ice cream. Quite creamy and mouth-filling on the palate, this medium-bodied rosé is fleshy and quite fruity on the finish. "

Drink now. The 2017 Vertice Apalta Vineyard is from a riper and more concentrated crop with lower yields and comes through as riper and rounder, with more fruit and concentration. There is more tannin and more power. Part of the wine now matures in oak foudres, and that is helping with the integration of the oak. "

TASTING NOTES: This wine powers on with impressive aromas and flavors of black fruit, well-defined grapey notes, and a hint of anise or tar. Enjoy it with a grilled, well-marbled ribeye. (Tasted: January 31, 2021, San Francisco, CA) It pours on the power. It strikes blow after blow of thick, sweet, dense flavour. Blackberry, honey, soy and malt, inflections of mint and cloves, a churn of grainy, muscular tannin. There's real flex here, real grunt. You either succumb or you stand out of its way. Red berry flavours add a brighter note; a light on a mountain of flavour. An almost Rhône-ish note of green olive on the nose gives the 2015 100 Year Old Vines Shiraz a bit extra complexity and intrigue. That note is layered over raspberry fruit, hints of vanilla and baking spices and a bit of cocoa. It's full-bodied but not heavy or overly extracted, with gentle, silky tannins that linger elegantly on the finish. Intense plum, spice and licorice flavors are plush and expressive, with a juicy side and velvety tannins. Cedar, tobacco and nutmeg accents linger on the generous finish. Drink now through 2030. 400 cases made, 20 cases imported. "

A hint of wood and licorice rounds it out nicely. Serve it with an oven-baked game hen. (Tasted: January 29, 2021, San Francisco, CA) Cherry pastry and plum paste flavors show notes of strawberry rhubarb in this red, with vanilla bean accents midpalate, followed by hot stone accents on the spicy finish. Reductive at first, with pronounced notes of oak, this wine becomes slithery and seductively rich on the palate in flavors of wild strawberry and raspberry. Black tea, nutmeg and forest tones add to its complex edginess. "
2856,Pegaso Sierra de Gredos Zeta,2019,Grenache,Spain,24,15,0.0,0,"2019 was a warm and challenging year in Gredos, with frost in March, hail in the summer and rains close to the harvest date. The 2019 Pegaso Zeta was produced with old-vine Garnacha on granite and schist soils. It fermented with indigenous yeasts in oak and stainless steel vats and amphorae, and it matured in a combination of 500- and 600-liter barrels, amphorae and stainless steel for 12 months. It's aromatic and expressive, with red fruit and herbs and unnoticeable oak. It's round and juicy, powerful and balanced with some grainy tannins. It's a wine that should do very well with food. "

(Tasted: September 12, 2022, San Francisco, CA) The NV Brut Nature Blanc de Blancs Cuvée des Chevaliers Grand Cru melds together the verve of Côtes de Blancs Chardonnay with an extra touch of vibrancy from the no dosage style, an approach that works beautifully here. Vivid and chiseled, the Cuvée des Chevaliers is naturally taut. But there is more than enough depth for the fruit to keep the wine from being austere. This is such a gorgeous and expressive Champagne. The latest rendition of Lacelot-Royer's NV Brut Nature Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Cuvée des Chevaliers delivers aromas of honeycomb, almond paste, crisp orchard fruit and white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, pillowy and precise, with bright acids and a fleshy core of fruit, it's seamless and nicely balanced. This is a fine effort that comes recommended. "
2858,Zenato Lugana Riserva Sergio Zenato,2018,Trebbiano,Italy,44,13.5,0.0,0,"The 2018 Lugana Riserva Sergio Zenato blossoms in the glass, as a whiff of vanilla bean and almond paste give way to a pretty mix of crushed yellow apples, nectarine and gingery spice. This is deeply textural, almost oily in feel, with a dense wave of mineral-tinged orchard fruits that coast along a core of brisk acidity. It leaves the palate reverberating with citrus tension, yet also an enriching air of custard that balances it all out. The Riserva is fermented in a combination of 70% oak casks, which adds amazing depth and body without taking away from the zesty character of the Trebbiano di Lugana variety, and in 30% stainless steel tank. The Zenato 2018 Lugana Riserva Sergio Zenato is redolent of peach, baked apple and honeycomb. This medium-bodied wine from a 60-hectare vineyard site with clay soils is nicely textured and spicy. This wine paints a pretty portrait of the elaborate side of the Trebbiano di Lugana grape that is gaining in popularity. The Zenato family was one of the first to offer it. With handmade-looking paper labels, there were 18,000 numbered bottles released. A rich and creamy white defined by vibrant acidity, this offers a fragrant range of lemon curd, poached apricot and pastry cream flavors with accents of smoke and toasted almond.

It has a sublime and utterly captivating bouquet of honeysuckle, white peach and flecks of white chocolate and orange peel, all beautifully defined. The palate is medium-bodied with a crisp entry, offering vivid scents of citrus peel, lime, orange zest and stem ginger toward a finish that fans out with brio. Another outstanding Cartology from Chris Alheit. "

2863,Quinta da Romaneira Vintage Port,2017,Port,Portugal,69,19.5,0.0,0,"Juicy and energetic in feel, this brims with cherry, blackberry and plum compote flavors, backed by red licorice, briar and chocolate notes. The long finish reveals a lush coating around an inner cable of refined tannins. Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca. Best from 2035 through 2055. The 2017 Vintage Port is mostly Touriga Nacional (70%), with the rest Touriga Franca, aged for 20 months in neutral tonels. It comes in with 89 grams of residual sugar. This was in bottle only a couple of weeks when tasted. This seems rich and fruity on opening, but not much more. Its fruit is just delicious, but I didn't get the sense of structure I saw from the 2016 last year. Yet, with two hours of air in a glass, this really blossomed, showing fine power, more focus and a serious backbone to go with its ripe fruit. This is another fine Romaneira, but I'm not sure yet that it exceeds the performance of the fine 2016. We will have to see how that goes in time and over the years. Dense, ripe and already open, this is a concentrated wine that has balanced tannins and juicy black currant fruits. Its richness is tempered by the fresh, dry streak of acidity and tannins. Drink from 2028. "

Spicy oak, red and black cherry and a swirl of cocoa powder give it a juicy midpalate. Still, it will do well in the cellar; enjoy 2027–2032.  A red that shows plenty of ripeness with blackberries, blueberries and hints of dried fruit and lavender. Full-bodied, juicy palate with ripe, round tannins and a flavorful finish. Lots of fruit at the end. Needs three or four years to come together. "
2865,ROCO Gravel Road Chardonnay,2018,Chardonnay,Oregon,26,13.5,3.0,18,"Smooth, rich and quickly accessible, this overdelivers for the cost. The lush, ripe fruits pull together pear, peach, melon and light tropical flavors. But this is no fruit salad of a wine; there are textural highlights with sandalwood, sassafras and cinnamon spices, finishing with a hint of honey. "
2866,Damien Coquelet Beaujolais Villages,2018,Gamay,France,24,11.5,0.0,0,"Dark red. Ripe red and blue fruits on the perfumed nose, along with a hint of pungent flowers.

Medium to full body with bright fruit and a long, vivid finish. Agile. Another fantastic wine from here after the 2018. 80% merlot, 10% cabernet franc and 10% cabernet sauvignon. Drinkable now, but Best after 2024. Coming from the incredible team at Pavie, the 2019 Clos Lunelles boasts a big, ripe, incredibly sexy and mouth-filling style as well as notes of black plums, black cherries, tobacco, and Asian spices. It brings serious fruit and opulence and is full-bodied, has a round, expansive mouthfeel, sweet tannins, and some obvious underlying minerality.

""Noi"" means ""us"" in Italian. Drawing its fruit from so many different sites, this 20,000-bottle production reveals a terrific sense of balance and brightness. Having those many elements to work with was especially important in a vintage like 2017 that saw spring frost followed by scorching summer temperatures. This wine manages to work it all out. A fine-tannined red for the vintage with firm, polished tannins that are refined in texture. Medium to full body. Savory finish. Needs at least two years to soften, but very pretty already. "

Generally speaking, vintners in Montalcino did an excellent job in the hot 2017 vintage by producing wines that are not jammy or baked. However, this wine definitely embraces a warm-vintage personality, and it flirts with the denser and softer side of Sangiovese. Oak spice and smoked tones help to flesh out this open and accessible release of 30,000 bottles. This Brunello is ready to go straight out of the gate. A big and rich Rasina with chocolate, berry and hints of meat. It’s full-bodied with round and juicy tannins and a long finish. Fresh at the end. Different and richer Brunello style from here.

This makes perfect sense given the scorching hot and dry conditions of this growing season. Rapace is a blend of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in French oak for 18 months. The wine delivers ripe and dark fruit, with a subtle dusting of crushed mineral that becomes more prominent as the wine takes on air in the glass. However, it is a bit thinner and shorter compared to the other vintages I tasted at the same time. Due to the difficulties of the vintage, production was reduced to 9,600 bottles.

The texture is full, with fairly gripping structure, and the palate is rich with black cherry, tea leaf, and forested earth. Drink this over the next 10 or more years. An alluring nose of woody spice, moss, suede and black cherry. Full-bodied with fine, slightly tight tannins. Earthy and savory on the palate with great intensity and depth. Nicely spiced. Give this a little more time to soften. Best after 2025. Packs some punch, with a dense and juicy core of linzer torte, blackberry and black cherry flavors. Well-defined, with light anise and apple wood accents through the structured finish. A bit unbridled in feel but will certainly have fans. Best from 2023 "

The 2019 Gigondas La Tour Sarrasine shows a touch more finesse and elegance, with beautiful red and blue fruits as well as notes of new saddle leather, lavender, and herbes de Provence. Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has terrific fruit, silky tannins, and great balance. It’s not over the top in any way, has a pure, seamless mouthfeel, and is another terrific Gigondas from this estate. A blend of 70% Grenache and 15% each of Syrah and Mourvèdre, it will evolve gracefully for 10-15 years. Best after 2022. "
3006,Benjamin Romeo Predicador Tinto,2014,Tempranillo,Spain,38,14.4,3.5,11,"Predicador was a wine that was born as a minor wine at a very specific moment in time, and many people (including yours truly) had not quite realized it has grown into an adult, proper Rioja red. The 2014 Predicador I tasted had only been bottled for two weeks and was a little dizzy. But if you wait or can read between the lines, it's terribly perfumed and intoxicating, with penetrating aromas of macerated cherries and very decayed violets, a little decadent. The palate is silky, with superb tannins and great balance. This is among the best vintages ever released since the initial 2004. "

The 2016 Vintage Porto is a mostly an equal blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, with various others comprising the last 20% of the juice. It comes in with 95 grams of residual sugar. This was in bottle about two months when tasted. Dark in color, with fine and expressive fruit, this shows intensity of flavor more than pure power. The fruit demonstrates nice lift as it opens with air. As with the Offley, this is a very nice success in this vintage, showing me fine fruit and reasonable structure. The concentration is good too, but it's not quite as impressive as the first two components. It is still excellent overall, the most exuberant of the three Sogrape Portos. We'll see how it ages and develops. For the moment, it is worth leaning up. Tightly knit nose, with firm berry fruit plus more savory, meaty lines. Nascent black fruit core to the dense, gritty palate. "

I love its purity as well as its balance, and it shows the lively, fresher style of the vintage nicely. Cedar shavings and pineapple mark the nose of the 2020 Crozes Hermitage Le Pontaix Blanc. Crisp and structured, this medium-bodied wine—the product of old-vine Marsanne grown on loess and granite near the village of Crozes-Hermitage—is out of the ordinary for the appellation, yet it works, showing ample concentration, focus and length. My estimate of its potential longevity may even prove to be conservative. "

It matures in old French oak barrels, developing a satin texture to gentle some of the tartness of the fruit. Concentrated without any sense of weight, this is layered in flavors of sour black cherries, black mushrooms, bitter chocolate and sanguine notes to the tannins. Decant it for lamb sausages. "

The NV Oloroso Asunción is a fortified effort made in a Solera, oxidative, off-dry style and sees 12-15 years in barrel. This medium to full-bodied, sweetly fruited effort has a layered, textured style that makes it a joy to drink as well as terrific notes of spice cabinet, caramel, and sautéed citrus fruits. Its sweetness is beautifully balanced, it has tons of charm, and it’s going to age forever in bottle. A pure pedro ximenez, aged to an average of 25 years, this has a deep, golden color and notes of toffee and mushroom, as well as a grilled biscuit-like edge. Super focused, sapid and salty mineral finish, amid smooth, layered texture. Drink now. Brown bread and walnut halva notes lead the way, followed by bitter almond, juniper and dried tea leaf accents. Shows a nervy edge on the finish, with racy acidity lending this a high-pitched character. Dark amber in color, the NV Asuncion Oloroso (100% Pedro Ximenez) shows honeyed caramel, nuts and almond-paste, but is richer and gives the impression of a relatively dry finish. "

This is perhaps juicier and has brighter fruit—red rather than black—compared to the one from Valtuille, where he has his winery. The soils here are slate-based, and the wine is perhaps fuller and has a different texture. It fermented in open-top barrels and matured in 500-liter barrels for one year, which might explain a subtle creaminess. "

3122,Celler Cal Pla Mas d'En Compte,2016,Other Red Blends,Spain,35,0,0.0,0,"Coming from the Porrera region of the Priorat, the 2016 Mas d'En Compte is a blend of 50% Grenache, 40% Carignan, and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, all from a single parcel, that was mostly destemmed (there are 30% stems) and aged 14 months in used French oak. It’s a beautiful wine that has a pretty, perfumed bouquet of violets, rose petals, road tar, and blueberries. This carries to a medium to full-bodied, elegant red that has good acidity, ample fruit, and a great finish. Its tannins are nicely integrated, everything is in the right place, and it’s one heck of a wine. Drink it any time over the coming decade. "
3123,Roberto Henriquez Tierra de las Pumas,2019,Pais,Chile,25,11.1,3.1,21,"The other new País is the 2019 Tierra de Pumas that comes from three hectares of old vines, the 77th vineyard registered in the zone, so one of the oldest remaining vineyards in Bio-Bio and possibly all of Chile, certainly over 200 years old. The soils are a mixture of granite and quartz with some clay, and the lower parts are more sedimentary, what it's locally called Serie Santa Juana because the vineyard is quite large. This is certainly different from the rest—if it's because of the soil or not is another story, but the vinification and élevage is very similar for all. There is a note that reminds me of blood orange peel and talcum powder, intensely aromatic, almost as if it went through semi-carbonic fermentation (which it did not). When tasted next to the other four País bottlings, this is the one that stands out because it has a different character. 10,000 bottles produced. "

For now it’s a little funky and a touch volatile, but the watermelon and fleshy red berry flavors win out. The palate is on the fuller end of the spectrum, but there’s freshness of character.

3201,Chateau Mouton Rothschild,2004,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,709,0,0.0,0,"This shows lots of mulled spice, warm tobacco leaf and well-roasted cedar accents, but isn't short on fruit, offering enticing layers of red currant, plum and blackberry confiture. The long finish is riddled with sweet smoke, black tea and iron notes. A gorgeous wine from an overlooked vintage. Supple and grand, Mouton has a heavenly richness in 2004... Deep garnet colour. Aromas of warm cassis, dried plum, cloves and pencil shavings. Medium+ acidity and medium to firm, fine tannins. Long finish. Tasted August 2009. "
3202,Chateau Lynch-Bages,2000,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,373,13.3,4.5,7,"Beginning to open magnificently, the still dense purple-colored 2000 reveals a blossoming bouquet of blackberries, cassis, graphite and pen ink. Full-bodied with velvety tannins that have resolved themselves beautifully over the last eleven years, this wine is still an adolescent, but it exhibits admirable purity, texture, mouthfeel and power combined with elegance. One of the all-time great examples of Lynch Bages, the 2000 is just beginning to drink well yet promises to last for another 20-25+ years. This is a superstructured wine with loads of plum, blackberry and licorice. Full-bodied, with chewy tannins and a long finish. Gorgeous. Tight. Needs time. Another wonderful 2000 coming out of its long sleep. Beautiful aromas of berry, tobacco, herb and spice that follow through to a full palate with round, textured tannins and lots of fruit. Typical of Lynch-Bages in its sumptuous rich style, this is a resounding success for the team of Jean-Michel Cazes. With its sweet fruit, opulent but balanced wood and red and black fruit flavors, it is a wine that will develop relatively quickly but will certainly age. No tasting note given. "

It’s full and flavorful with lots going on. Layered and intense. This is impressive now, but even better in a year or two. A smooth texture masks good concentration in this juicy red, with a firm structure. Ripe cherry and plum flavors mingle with coffee and toasty notes, showing touches of herb and loamy earth. A blackish-purple color and forceful oak that lends a chocolaty, tarry, smoky topping to the nose open this bold but balanced crianza. Blackberry, tobacco, black tea and oak flavors are strong and heady. Prune and woodspice notes dominate the finish. "

It fermented with 50% full clusters and matured in concrete for six months. It has only 11% alcohol and a low pH of 3.3. This is young, unoaked and fruit-driven, floral and very expressive. In the old times, there were up to 8,000 hectares of Sumoll in Penedès, but a lot was uprooted and used for homemade wine. Thankfully, the variety is coming back, as it has a lot of potential. They started in 2008 when the grape was admitted by the appellation of origin Penedès, and the idea is to show the naked variety. It's a refreshing wine, balanced, medium-bodied. "

The Cruz del Mar is the paradigm of summer Fino, ideal to drink at the beach. With its firm structure, salty touches, tense acidity, details of mushrooms and the textured sensation of drinking lime, this is a mirror of the white albariza soil of Jerez. "
3229,Domaine Rolet Cremant du Jura,Brut,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,22,12,3.7,15,"A tense, floral sparkler, this feels cool, crisp and linear. It has a salty mineral edge to the lees that would work well with brandade de morue, and it would be refreshing with salted herring. "

The 60-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is fragrant and fruity, redolent of bright cherries and raspberries along with earthy peppery spices, dried florals and a hint of graphite. Fruit on the palate is crunchy and tart, as mouthwatering acidity buoys it, emphasized by a tight grip of herbaceous tannins and a mineral graphite streak on the finish.

3238,Chateau Lafite Rothschild,1996,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,629",13,4.8,6,"This is compelling, with a bright, forward currant fruit that is opening well now to show the nuance of game, earth, and gunflint to the ripe, dark fruit. The texture is tannic and fresh, with tannins starting to loosen but still in evidence. A luminous, radiant wine that will doubtless improve for another half-century. Drinking Window 2022 - 2082. The 1996 Lafite-Rothschild was remarkably deep in color considering that it is now 20 years in age. The bouquet is classic Pauillac with pencil shavings and sous-bois infusing the black fruit, masculine and a little aloof, yet focused and very well delineated. The palate is very well balanced with crisp blackberry and boysenberry fruit, spicier than I recollect, a crescendo of flavors so that it seems understated at first but fans out with a sense of confidence towards the finish. The beauty and balance of this are phenomenal. Seamless tannins and fruit. Full body yet so balanced and refined. Sweet tobacco and berries. Minerals and cedar. A beautiful wine. The depth is superb. Gorgeous aromas of currant, berries and licorice. Full-bodied, with supersilky tannins and a long, caressing finish. "
3239,El Coto Rosado,2020,Rosé,Spain,12,0,3.5,12,"A bright raspberry-colored rosé with cherry, candied-apple, watermelon and red-plum aromas. It’s medium-to full-bodied with a creamy texture. Fruity and flavorful. Dry. Tempranillo and garnacha. Drink now. "
3240,Bodegas Jorge Ordonez Malaga Botani Old Vines Moscatel,2019,Muscat,Spain,18,14.5,3.4,13,"Lots of beeswax, dried apple and pineapple with some lime. It’s full-bodied, dense and waxy. Flavorful finish. Old-school, yet fun. The 2019 Botani Old Vine Moscatel has a bright, juicy style in its honeyed lime, tangerine, toasted nut, and spicy aromatics. These carry to a medium-bodied, clean, juicy, sweetly fruited white with bright acidity and a clean, classy style on the palate. "
3241,Chateau Fleur La Mothe,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,16,14,3.4,9,"A lovely kick of Petit Verdot spice and grilled oak through the finish coupled with polished tannins, which makes this a good choice in the vintage. Expect plenty of cassis and blueberry fruits. Mouthfilling overall with a supple texture. This estate is a joint project of consultants Edouard Massie, Henri Boyer, Antoine Médeville, Emilien Delalande and Thomas Marquant. 33% new oak for 12 months in barrel. Tasted twice. Drinking Window 2023 - 2038 Aromas of blackberries, dark chocolate and dried violets. Oyster-shell and meaty aromas, too. It’s medium-bodied with sleek tannins. Soft and supple. Nice, subtle texture. Try from 2022. The 2018 Fleur la Mothe offers up rich aromas of cassis and blackberries mingled with loamy soil and cigar wrapper. Medium to full-bodied, broad and ample, it's the fleshiest, largest-scaled, most mouth-filling vintage in this small vertical, yet the signature of the vintage doesn't efface its Médoc origins. Spicy oak, tobacco, dried flowers, and blackcurrant notes all make an appearance in the 2018 Château Fleur La Mothe. This beautiful, seamless 2018 is medium to full-bodied and has a plump, rounded texture, ripe tannins, and a great finish. A satisfying, balanced Médoc, it should have a solid 8-10 years of prime drinking. I'm a fan and would be happy to have a bottle on the dinner table. "
3242,Alain Voge Cornas Vieilles Vignes,2009,Syrah/Shiraz,France,289,13.5,0.0,0,"This is loaded with vivacious character, as a lively briar note punctuates the grippy charcoal, sweet tapenade, blackberry coulis and macerated plum fruit flavors. The long, iron-driven finish lets the fruit play out. Best from 2014 through 2024. "
3243,Sine Qua Non The Duel Grenache,2008,Grenache,California,559,15.8,0.0,0,"Sine Qua Non’s 2008 Grenache Estate The Duel boasts extraordinary richness, power and sheer depth. Tobacco, leather, mint and spices are woven together in this large-scaled Grenache. There is plenty of intensity here, but the 2008 has just a touch less aromatic definition than the very finest wines at Sine Qua Non. I imagine some of that may be the result of extended aging in oak. The 2008 is 82% Grenache, 14% Syrah, 2% Viognier and 1% Roussanne, all from the Eleven Confessions Vineyard in Santa Rita Hills. A portion of the Grenache was fermented using whole clusters. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2023. Remarkably elegant and understated, offering generous, supple plum, blueberry, pepper and spice. Deceptively sleek and subdued, unfolding slowly and gracefully. Drink now through 2020. "
3244,Chateau Leoville Las Cases,1999,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,259,0,0.0,0,"This is so fresh still, just a baby. Blackberry, mineral, floral and blueberry aromas follow through to a full body, with focused, subtle fruit and a racy, refined and reserved tannin structure. This really needs time. Cuddled up in a ball of tannins.—'89/'99 Bordeaux blind retrospective (2009). Best after 2013. 15,000 cases made. "
3245,Pride Mountain Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (slightly torn label),2004,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,139,14.5,0.0,0,"Soft, rich and ripe, this is one of those Cabernets that feels dramatic in the mouth. Partly it's the fruit; complex in cherries, blackberries, mocha and rum and cola. Partly it's the oak and partly it's the fabulous balance of rich, sweet tannins and acidity. Put it all together, and it's irresistible. Though percentages from the two counties imply a blend, this is, in fact, a wine from one contiguous estate, straddling the border of Napa and Sonoma at the top of Spring Mountain. Most of the Cabernet is planted at the higher elevations of Pride's property, where the soils are particularly thin: gravel patchworks of volcanic rock, sandstone, clay and loam. They grow a structured Cabernet with distinctively pure black currant flavor, this '04 potent with the mineral tannin of those mountain soils. Check on it ten years from the vintage; it should continue to develop beyond that. "
3246,Pride Mountain Vineyards Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon,2011,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,195,14.4,0.0,0,"There are 1,374 cases of the 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve, which spent 22 months in 40% new French oak. It exhibits classic notes of new saddle leather, unsmoked cigar tobacco, red and blackcurrants, and loamy soil undertones in a full-bodied, intense, opulent, fleshy style. 85% came from Sonoma County and 15% from Napa County. This beauty is on a fast evolutionary track, so drink it during its first 7-8 years of life. Pride’s wines rarely fail to find an extra measure of richness, and, even in a vintage where richness was not always easy to achieve, this ripe and generously filled Cabernet lives up to winery expectations. It is impressively concentrated but stops well short of excess, and, if fairly sturdy in build, it flirts with an early suggestion of polish that makes it easy to believe in its future. "
3247,Chateau Lynch-Bages,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,149,13.5,4.3,9,"One of the finest Pauillacs of 2015, Lynch-Bages is rich, racy and voluptuous. A rush of dark red and purplish stone fruit, mint, new leather, spice and blood orange give the 2015 a very decidedly exotic character that is impossible to miss. Raspberry jam, mocha, new leather and expressive floral notes appear with time in the glass, rounding things out nicely. Even though the 2015 is quite forward and open at this stage, the wine has plenty of stuffing as well as the underlying structure to support many years of exceptional drinking. This is a stellar showing for Lynch-Bages. Brambly and attractive ripe blackberries and red-plum aromas with some floral accents, too. The palate has a very plush, polished and regal shape as tannins frame up a core of ripe black fruit. Succulent, impressive finish. Best from 2022. This has an ample core of plum, fig and blackberry compote flavors, underlined liberally with graphite and smoldering tobacco notes. Fleshy and focused, with ample grip through the juniper- and tar-accented finish. Well-built. Best from 2023 through 2038. This is powerful and deep with high but careful extraction and firm tannins. At this stage it feels so much younger and more closed than almost anything else I’ve tasted from this vintage in Pauillac. This is going for a firm, impressive impact and it manages it, but it lacks some generosity in the fruit character that it has in spades in 2016. 2% Petit Verdot. 75% new oak. One-third malolactic fermentation in vats, two-thirds in barrel. Always on my radar screen as wines to buy, I have always found this 5th Growth to be under-classified. While many in the wine trade place this wine in the 2nd Growth, I see it comfortably in the 3rd Growth arena, and indeed this wine has sometimes overtaken some of the highly vaunted 1st Growths. The 2015 Château Lynch Bages is handsome in so many ways. This wine exhibits beautifully attired black currants and a shading of oak. Enjoy its perfectly claret disposition with a juicy ribeye. (Tasted: January 25, 2018, San Francisco, CA) "
3248,Chateau Ausone,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,049",14,0.0,0,"The 2016 Ausone is a blend of 50% Cabernet Franc and 50% Merlot. Deep garnet-purple colored, it's quite closed at first glance, slowly unfurling to reveal the most incredible perfume of violets, chocolate-covered cherries, warm black plums, Black Forest cake and roasted nuts with suggestions of charcuterie, wood smoke and cedar chest. The medium to full-bodied palate offers a quiet intensity of flavors that grow in the mouth to unveil layer after layer of black and red berries intertwined with beautiful savory notions framed by firm yet velvety tannins, finishing with epic length and amazing energy. It practically tingles on the palate! The incredible succulent power in Ausone puts a different perspective on other wines, as it so often does. The epitome of perfumed finesse. The yield is up at 40hl/ha, high for these poor limestone soils, and the remarkable clarity of expression that runs right through the delicate but fleshy raspberry and smoke-tinged palate is helped by a pH of 3.5 (compared to 3.6 last year). In my book this counts as one of the truly exciting signatures of the vintage and that is only boosted by the limestone terroir. Stunning, with enormous persistency and a finish that just doesn't want to quit. Very exotic and fascinating with dark-berry, floral and violet aromas that follow though to a full body that is tight and polished with ultra-fine and driven tannins. They really are amazing. A wine with such strength and finesse at the same time. Confident and real Ausone. The 2016 Château Ausone is up with the crème de la crème of the vintage and isn’t far off the thrilling 2015, although it shows a more seamless, elegant character. Loads of spice, crushed violets, floral notes and subtle oak give way to a full-bodied beauty that has thrilling cassis and black raspberry fruits, polished tannin, perfect balance, and a great, great finish. This thrilling Ausone needs 4-6 years of bottle age but will keep for 30 years or more. "
3249,Chateau Mouton Rothschild,1993,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,599,0,0.0,0,"Mouton comes through again. Impressive '93, deep in color and full-bodied, boasting plenty of currant, black cherry, mint and toast character. Well crafted, showing depth for this vintage. After less than persuasive performances in two potentially great years, 1989 and 1990, Mouton-Rothschild appears to have settled down, producing fine efforts in recent vintages, culminating with the enormously promising, unquestionably profound 1995. The 1993 is a beautifully made wine which could be considered a sleeper of the vintage. The wine boasts a dark purple color, followed by a sweet, pain grillee, roasted nut, and cassis-scented bouquet that is just beginning to open. In the mouth, the wine may not possess the body and volume of a vintage such as 1990 or 1989, but there is more richness of fruit, a sweet, ripe, pureness to the wine, as well as medium body and outstanding balance. Mouton's great winemaking comes to the fore in this wine in the face of the difficult year of 1993. It's a surprisingly substantial Bordeaux for such a wet growing season, even now displaying strong blackberries and mint flavors. Full-bodied with tannins that are just coming around. "
3250,Sine Qua Non This Is Not An Exit Syrah,2009,Syrah/Shiraz,California,519,15.6,0.0,0,"An extended barrel-aged release, the 2009 Syrah This Is Not An Exit is 100% from the Santa Rita Hills Eleven Confessions Vineyard and checks in as a blend of 80% Syrah, 12% Grenache, 7% Roussanne and 1% Viognier that saw 41.5 months in 65% new French oak. Slightly exotic, with notions of kirsch, flower oil, smoked meats, licorice and graphite, it hits the palate with full-bodied richness and depth, loads of fruit and a blockbuster finish. More approachable than the 2010 extended barrel age Syrah, this beauty will still have 15+ years of longevity. Drink now-2024. "
3251,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon,1991,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,549,0,0.0,0,"The superb 1991 Cask 23 Proprietary Red Wine appears to be one of the truly outstanding examples of this expensive proprietary red wine. The wine's saturated dark purple color is followed by a huge, unevolved but sexy nose of toasty new oak, dense, black-cherry and jammy cassis fruit, and vague scents of underbrush and spice. Extremely rich and concentrated, it offers intriguing blackcurrant and coffee flavors, full body, remarkable harmony, and a finish that lasts for nearly a minute. Still young, unevolved, and less flattering at present than the more open knit 1990, it merits cellaring of 2-4 years. Smells complex and keeps introducing new flavor nuances, with an array of stewed plum, coffee, currant, black olive, roasted pine nut, red plum and red licorice. Shows a mix of youthful and mature flavors.--'81/'91 California Cabernet retrospective. Drink now through 2006. 2,500 cases made. "
3252,Sine Qua Non Dangerous Birds Grenache,2007,Grenache,California,969,0,0.0,0,"This is shipping next April. This is 100% from Eleven Confessions Vineyard. This has spent 34 months in barrel and never racked. Full and beautiful with sliced plums and berries. Super velvety tannins. Soft too. Tight and in reserve. Phenomenal depth of fruit. This is so deep. I love it. Just a baby. A wine you really have to get to know. You have to feel it. Reminds me of the 1989 Rayas. The evolution will be amazing for decades to come. The 2007 Grenache Dangerous Birds, from the Eleven Confessions Vineyard, is a big, huge wine loaded with dark cherries, plums, licorice and smoke, all of which come together in a sensual, captivating wine of the highest level. This shows gorgeous inner perfume and fabulous overall balance. The silkiest of tannins frame the long finish. If forced to choose, I have a slight preference for the 2008 among the Estate Grenaches, but both wines are beautiful. Dangerous Birds is 88% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 2% Viognier. A portion of the Grenache (36% of the total blend) was fermented with whole clusters. The wine spent 34 months in oak and was bottled in August 2010. A rich, graceful mix of dark berry, charcoal, subtle cedar and spice notes joins shades of dried berry. This is medium- to full-bodied and elegantly styled, ending with a pleasing lift. "
3253,Levy & McClellan Proprietary Red,2007,Other Red Blends,California,599,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon has closed down slightly since last year. Now in bottle, it exhibits an opaque purple color as well as a similar but more subdued bouquet of lead pencil shavings, burning embers, blueberry liqueur, creme de cassis and flowers. Powerful, rich and pure, its statuesque structure, lavish concentration and formidable tannin levels suggest 3-5 years of bottle age is warranted. This may turn out to be the finest Cabernet Sauvignon produced in the short history of the Levy and McClellan Diamond Mountain winery, although the 2008 has the potential to equal it. The 2007 should last for three decades or more. "
3254,Chateau Rayas Chateaneuf-du-Pape Reserve,2009,Rhone Red Blends,France,"2,699",0,0.0,0,"The 2009 Rayas Chateauneuf du Pape is an awesome example of elegance combined with extraordinary power. The alcohol levels must be between 15.5% and 16%, but the elegance and sublime nature of this wine make it irresistible. Its dense ruby/purple color is followed by an extraordinary bouquet of framboise, black cherry liqueur intermixed with blacker fruits, licorice and a hint of flowers. Pure with terrific layers of fruit concentration (although it's remarkably light on its feet), silky tannins, well-integrated acidity and a stunning personality, this monumental Rayas is breathtaking. This beauty will undoubtedly be drinkable early on (although Emmanuel Reynaud considers that to be infanticide), and it is capable of lasting 25-30 years. The 2009 Châteauneuf Du Pape Reserve from Rayas is a beauty that shows the hallmark elegance and complexity of this estate paired with plenty of opulence and sweet fruit. Incredible Provençal notes of kirsch liqueur, herbes de Provence, framboise, and flowery incense all emerge from the glass, and it’s full-bodied, has sweet tannins, and an almost over-the-top personality that’s a joy to drink. It’s impossible to resist today yet will evolve for 25-30 years or more. This comes closest in my mind to the 2007 with its opulent, sexy style. "
3255,Sine Qua Non In Flagrante Syrah,2000,Syrah/Shiraz,California,799,0,0.0,0,"The 2000 In Flagrante (a 725-case blend of 86% Syrah, 10% Grenache, and 4% Viognier) is a world-class, provocative effort. It reveals many of the same aromatic and flavor components found in the 2001 Midnight Oil and 2002 Syrah-dominated, unnamed offering. A black color is followed by a seamless effort loaded with blackberry, honey, and flower aromas, and an extraordinarily long, concentrated finish. As with all great wines, tasting notes/descriptors just can't do it justice. Among the recent SQN Syrahs, it is a strikingly elegant and powerful wine that has a decidedly French flair to it. "
3256,Chateau L'Evangile,2014,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,215,14,4.4,8,"The 2014 L'Evangile comes racing out of the blocks on the nose with plenty of black cherry, blueberry, cold stone and black truffle scents, quintessentially Pomerol with impressive delineation and focus. The palate is medium-bodied with a slightly grainy texture, lovely black fruit here laced with Earl Grey, spice and sage, quite intense and fanning out gloriously towards the long finish. This seems to have gained precision after bottling and I did warn that it may merit a higher score. This is a deeply impressive L'Evangile that might challenge Lafite-Rothschild in the long term. Chapeau! The blackberry, mushroom and oyster-shell character really comes out. Full body and flavors of dark chocolate, walnuts and concentrated berries. Structured. Bitter-chocolate aftertaste. Try drinking in 2022. Big, bold and ripe, this is a rich wine with its 82% Merlot. It is jammy while keeping its tannins and structure. Ripe and full in the mouth, the wine is firm enough to age for a long time. It is going to be generous, full and ripe. Drink from 2025. This alluring red features velvety tannins carrying notes of crushed plum, warm blackberry preserves and dark licorice, gaining muscle through the charcoal-scored finish. There's a deep tug of warm earth throughout, and this needs a little time to stretch out. Best from 2020 through 2030. A blend of 82% Merlot and 18% Cabernet Franc from the team at Rothschild, the 2014 L’Evangile is a ripe, sexy effort that gives up lots of cassis and black raspberry fruits, toasty oak, Asian spices, and chocolate. A wine that gains depth and richness with time in the glass, it offers medium to full-bodied richness, a silky, expressive style, and sweet tannin, all making for a seductive, impossible to resist Pomerol. This beauty hit 14% natural alcohol, so it’s no lightweight, yet it lacks the depth and density of the 2015. Drink this impressive 2014 anytime over the coming 15-20 years. Slightly trimmer and less opulent in style with all the estate's Cabernet Franc in the blend (18%). Gently aromatic with attractive fruit. Long and silky on the palate. Touch of alcohol on the finish but balanced by the freshness of the tannins. "
3257,Chateau Canon (1.5 Liter Magnum),2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,399,0,0.0,0,"Complex aromas of blackberries, iodine, oyster shell and wet earth. Ever so perfumed. Full-bodied, yet reserved and tight with very silky tannins that are energized and minerally. Takes off at the end. The freshness lifts it. Try after 2024. This has all the power that St-Emilion can deliver, but deals it out slowly with precision, gorgeous balance and a clean lift. It has great concentration, purity and depth, without sacrificing the integrity of the juicy blueberry and cassis fruits. It really is a great example of what the limestone plateau can do. The 2015 delivers a slightly more voluptuous edge to the fruits, whereas this vintage emphasises fresh mint leaf, salinity and grip. A wonderful wine, utterly delicious. The 2016 Château Canon is another beautiful wine from this estate, made in a more streamlined, elegant style compared to the richer, sexier 2015. Checking in as a blend of 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc all from a magical terroir situated on the upper plateau just outside of the village of Saint-Emilion, it saw a small percentage of the blend go through malolactic fermentation in barrel, and the wine spent 18 months in 70% new French oak, with the balance in once-used. Gorgeous notes of blueberries, cassis, spring flowers, white truffle, and crushed rock nuances all come soaring from the glass and it has notable intensity as well as complexity. Medium to full-bodied, with vibrant acidity, ultra-fine tannins, and a straight, silky texture, I don’t think it matches the 2015 on concentration, but it’s perfectly balanced and has a texture to die for. It needs a good 4-5 years of bottle age (or more) and it’s going to be long-lived. Tasted three times. Very generously appointed with ripe, black cherry fruit and decked
out with a broad sweep of sweet spice in both scent and taste
and showing lovely continuity and fine concentration, Château
Canon is a serious, far-reaching St.-Emilion wine that compels
contemplation and seems to reveal a little more interest with
each sniff and sip. It is not an immense wine, but it is one of
great strength and real beauty that is guaranteed to pay even
greater dividends when laid away and allowed to develop for six
to ten years. "
3258,Thienot Brut,Rose,Sparkling Rosé,France,79,12.5,4.6,5,"Lean, spicy and refreshing, this wine cuts its strawberry and rhubarb flavors with mineral abrasion. Then cool juiciness comes up in the end. It’s a clean wine for littleneck clams. "
3259,Chateau Mouton Rothschild (US label),1993,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,519,0,0.0,0,"Mouton comes through again. Impressive '93, deep in color and full-bodied, boasting plenty of currant, black cherry, mint and toast character. Well crafted, showing depth for this vintage. Give the tannins some time to mellow. After less than persuasive performances in two potentially great years, 1989 and 1990, Mouton-Rothschild appears to have settled down, producing fine efforts in recent vintages, culminating with the enormously promising, unquestionably profound 1995. The 1993 is a beautifully made wine which could be considered a sleeper of the vintage. The wine boasts a dark purple color, followed by a sweet, pain grillee, roasted nut, and cassis-scented bouquet that is just beginning to open. In the mouth, the wine may not possess the body and volume of a vintage such as 1990 or 1989, but there is more richness of fruit, a sweet, ripe, pureness to the wine, as well as medium body and outstanding balance. This moderately tannic, well-focused, surprisingly rich 1993 is capable of 15-20 years of evolution. Mouton's great winemaking comes to the fore in this wine in the face of the difficult year of 1993. It's a surprisingly substantial Bordeaux for such a wet growing season, even now displaying strong blackberries and mint flavors. Full-bodied with tannins that are just coming around. "
3260,Marchesi Fumanelli Squarano Valpolicella Classico Superiore,2014,Other Red Blends,Italy,80,14,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2014 Marchesi Fumanelli Squarano Valpolicella Classico Superiore is attractive and expansive on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine brings a rush of ripe red fruits and a hint of wood in its aromas and flavors. Enjoy it with oven-baked, skin-on chicken thighs.  (Tasted: November 1, 2020, San Francisco, CA) "
3261,M. Chapoutier Ermitage Le Pavillon,2016,Syrah/Shiraz,France,789,14.5,0.0,0,"Aged entirely in barriques (25% new), the 2016 Ermitage le Pavillon shows only a hint of warm pencil shavings on the nose, beautifully setting up notes of fresh blackcurrants. Full-bodied, concentrated and plush across the mid-palate, it turns rich and velvety on the nearly endless finish, marked by savory notes of beef, licorice and espresso. If you wish to catch a glimpse of this wine's greatness, it would be no crime to open a bottle upon release, as I suspect it will close down for a number of years soon afterward. More structured and tannic, yet sensationally concentrated, the 2016 Ermitage Le Pavillon comes all from the broken granite soils of the Bessards lieu-dit and was brought up in just 30% new French oak. It gives up awesome notes of blue fruits, crushed rocks, graphite, and lit gunpowder. Rich, full-bodied, and incredibly massive and opulent on the palate, yet with serious amounts of tannins, extract, and depth, it's a tour de force and one of the gems in the vintage as well as a monumental Hermitage. Hide bottles for 5-7 years, count yourself lucky, and enjoy over the following 4-5 decades. Matured in 28% new oak for 20 months. Aromas of soy, plum sauce, blackberry and blackcurrant. Exceptional smoothness of tannin, very seductive, almost drinkable now. There's lovely purity and acidity running through to a long finish. Exceptionally pretty and pure, but powerful. A black stallion of a wine. Drinking Window 2022 - 2040 Smoldering black tea, bay leaf and tobacco hints swirl around a core of gently mulled black cherry and blackberry
fruit flavors, ending with singed mesquite and sassafras notes. Sneakily long. This will take time to unwind in the
cellar. Best from 2021 through 2040. Luminous blackberry and raspberry flavors are edged by shards of stone and smoke in this deeply fruity but intensely mineral Syrah. It’s fresher and brighter in fruit than the producer’s other 2016 Hermitage, full bodied but taut and bracing in feel. Rigid tannins should meld as the wine opens and gains complexity. Best enjoyed from 2022, it should reward cellaring well through 2040. "
3262,Col d'Orcia Spezieri,2017,Tuscan Blends,Italy,21,0,3.8,10,"Plenty of soaked blueberry peel, freshly picked herbs and lemons. Light to medium body, fine tannins and a fruity finish. Drink now. Made from organically grown grapes. "

Lancelot-Royer Blanc de Blancs 2013 is rich and lasting on the palate. TASTING NOTES: This wine shines with aromas and flavors of savory spices, earth, and ripe fruit.

3264,Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou,1996,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,319,0,0.0,0,"I tasted the 1996 Ducru Beaucaillou on four separate occasions from bottle in January. The 1996 is long, with a deep mid-palate. It also reveals tannin in the finish. This wine is remarkable. It is muscular, concentrated, and classic. Bottled in late June, 1998, it exhibits a saturated ruby/purple color, as well as a knock-out nose of minerals, licorice, cassis, and an unmistakable lead pencil smell that I often associate with top vintages of Lafite-Rothschild. It is sweet and full-bodied, yet unbelievably rich with no sense of heaviness or flabbiness. The wine possesses high tannin, but it is extremely ripe, and the sweetness of the black currant, spice-tinged Cabernet Sauvignon fruit is pronounced. This profound, backward Ducru-Beaucaillou is a must purchase. It will be fascinating for readers who own the 1996 to follow the evolution of this exceptional vintage. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2035. The 1996 Ducru-Beaucaillou is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot harvested from the 23rd of September to the 8th of October. Medium brick colored, it delivers mature notes of sweaty leather, camphor, tobacco and dried mulberries with a core of kirsch, charcuterie and dried cranberries plus a waft of sandalwood. Medium-bodied, the palate has fantastic freshness with a light chewiness to the texture and loads of herbs spark red and black fruits, finishing earthy. Intense aromas of cedar, vanilla, leather and blackberry. Full-bodied, with coffee, vanilla, ripe fruit and a medium finish. Just about ready. The 1995 is certainly better.--'95/'96 Bordeaux retrospective. Drink now. 18,000 cases made. "
3265,Jean-Louis Chave Hermitage,1991,Syrah/Shiraz,France,"2,899",0,0.0,0,"At maturity, the 1991 Hermitage shows the hallmark elegance and finesse of this estate with its layered, perfumed aromas and flavors of rose petal, mint, leather and still fresh and lively fruit. More elegant and complex than powerful, this beauty will continue to evolve gracefully on its balance. Nevertheless, I’d line bottles up for drinking over the coming 4-5 years. "
3266,Osborne VORS Sibarita 1792 VORS Oloroso Sherry,(500ML),Sherry,Spain,145,20,4.7,14,"Fantastically complex nose with chocolate, roast coffee, raisins and lovely wood spice. The NV Sibarita Oloroso VORS is produced with Palomino grapes, balanced with 2% of Pedro Ximenez, something quite common to polish the edges of very old wines, in a solera created in 1792. It has a dark mahogany color, and the nose shows some toffee notes intermixed with roasted coffee, tar, ash and incense. The palate shows good depth, strong acidity, well compensated by the sweetness, and a slightly bitter finish. It stands apart from other Olorosos, with a unique range of aromas and flavors. 1,500 bottles are filled each year. Drink 2013-2020. Sibarita is dry—extremely dry—but also exquisitely sophisticated in flavor: smoky, earthy and sweetly complex. Its saline acidity and steely mineral structure lend a firm backbone. A classic Oloroso, this comes from a solera established in 1792; the current bottling represents wines that are at least 30 years old. This has good range, with walnut and Brazil nut notes weaving around dried orange, date, clove, black tea and salted caramel accents. Stays dry and taut through the lengthy finish, with a lovely singed juniper detail. "
3267,Chateau Leoville Barton (1.5 Liter Magnum),2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,369,14,0.0,0,"Terrific intensity of dark berries, almost peppery blackcurrants and violets with attractive and integrated, spicy oak and an earthy edge. The palate has a super powerful and long, linear core with plenty of fruit flesh strapped in tight for a long and thrilling ride into the finish. A blend of 86 per cent cabernet and 14 per cent merlot. Try from 2024. This is so vivid as it brims with pastis-soaked plum, blackberry, black currant and blueberry paste flavors, all carried by a perfectly integrated brambly spine. Tar and ganache notes give the finish an extra kick while everything stays within the mouthwatering roasted apple wood frame. Both regal and rambunctious, this is St.-Julien to a T. Best from 2025 through 2040. A brilliant young wine, the 2016 Léoville Barton unwinds in the glass with aromas of cassis, dark berries and cigar box mingled with subtle hints of loamy soil. Medium to full-bodied, deep and concentrated, it's seamless and exquisitely balanced, with beautifully refined tannins, bright acids and a long, penetrating finish. Its structural refinement is such that it's far from forbidding to open right now, yet patience will be richly rewarded. This vintage is dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, making it comparable to some top Pauillacs. The Barton family has owned these vineyards for centuries and always makes very fine claret, but this is exceptional. Opulent and vibrant nose, crammed with blackcurrant. Depth, grip and concentration, but balanced and stylish too, with notable freshness. For the long haul. Drinking Window 2024 - 2045 Effusively fruity and fresh on the nose and very well-concentrated if showing a bit of youthful tightness on the palate, this wine starts out with a real sense of promise only partially kept in its slightly taut, not-fully-developed flavors. It in some ways recalls the reticence of the wine from its slightly more northerly-sited neighbor, Château Leoville-Poyferré, but it is slightly deeper with more fruit consequence and is the one we would more readily choose to age. "
3268,Rene Rostaing Cote-Rotie La Landonne,1998,Syrah/Shiraz,France,429,0,0.0,0,"Gorgeous, with aromas of game and garrigue, followed by lush black cherry and blackberry fruit, roasted espresso bean, cocoa and game flavors and a long herb and mineral-driven finish. Great silky texture despite all its power. Sadly, there are only 7,700 bottles of the 1998 Cote Rotie La Landonne. This spectacular offering boasts a deep purple color in addition to a dense nose that the French would call a confiture of black fruits, particularly plums, blackberries, and black currants. Superb aromatics jump from the glass of this young, unevolved 1998. On the palate, it is deep and dense, with a multi-layered texture, and terrific purity and concentration. It possesses a sweet, concentrated mid-palate, well-integrated tannin, and a long finish. "
3269,Chateau Latour (1.5 Liter Magnum),1994,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,399",0,0.0,0,"This is an interesting as well as great vintage for Latour. As indicated in my barrel tasting report, Latour's 1994 possesses an atypically high percentage of Merlot (27%) in the final blend. Because of this, the wine appears to have a sweeter, more fleshy texture than is typical for a young Latour, but do not make the mistake of thinking this will be a commercially-styled, easy to drink wine. It exhibits an opaque dark ruby/purple color, and a backward, intense textbook nose of walnut and cassis scents complemented by smoky pain grille notes that build in the glass. This full-bodied, powerful, layered Latour reveals high tannin, but no bitterness or astringency. The superb purity, fabulous precision, and remarkable length should ensure 35-40 years of longevity. Readers will find more fat, flesh, and glycerin than usual for a young Latour (save for such great vintages as 1982 and 1990), but don't be deceived, this wine requires 8-10 years of cellaring. Anticipated maturity: 2005-2035. Classic Cabernet style. Intense aromas of plums and cherries, with hints of new wood. Full-bodied, with juicy and ripe tannins and a long finish. Very well-structured. "
3270,Carpineto Chianti Classico Gran Selezione,2015,Sangiovese,Italy,79,14.25,3.9,6,"This red offers depth and complexity, drawing you in with sensuous aromas of black cherry, black currant, violet, iron, leather and tar. Rich and smooth, backed by firm, refined tannins. Shows excellent balance and length. Best from 2021 through 2038. Carpineto farms Sangiovese and other grapes in the most important wine appellations of Tuscany, including Chianti Classico, Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. This is the first time I am seeing a Gran Selezione from this far-reaching estate. The 2015 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione shows dark fruit, plum, prune and soft touches of potting soil. The wine delivers thick lines and dense contours that are even more evident in this hot and sunny vintage. This would be a nice Sangiovese to pair with a Tuscan peposo—meat stewed in tomato and red wine. "
3271,Alvear,Fino,Other Fortified,Spain,18,15,3.4,8,"Unique aromas of dried apples, asphalt and steel follow through to a medium to full body with cooked-apple flavor. Fruity, funky and fun. Drink now. "
3272,Chateau Bellevue Mondotte,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,199,14.5,0.0,0,"This almost pure merlot shows a solid core of dark berries and a hint of dark chocolate. Full-bodied, ripe and round with compact tannins. Extremely long and intentional. Gorgeous finish. Drink after 2025. A very polished and frankly ripe style, with caressing cassis and creamed raspberry notes cruising through, infused with anise and warm licorice flavors that drape across the finish. Despite the obvious style, this has density without coming off as heavy, with a very long finish that lets the fruit sing. Will have fans for sure. Best from 2021 through 2035. The six-acre vineyard sits on the plateau of Saint-Émilion. Juicy acidity and fresh black fruits give this wine an immediately attractive character. It is enhanced by perfumed tannins: not dry, almost sweet and certainly rich. Drink this wine from 2024. "
3273,Chateau Rayas Chateaneuf-du-Pape Reserve,2005,Rhone Red Blends,France,"2,799",0,0.0,0,"I could not resist retasting the 2005 Rayas Chateauneuf du Pape. Until the 2007 is in bottle, the 2005 is clearly the greatest wine made at this estate since the 1995. Made from 100% Grenache, it boasts an unusually (for Rayas) dark ruby/purple-tinged color as well as an exceptionally sweet bouquet of black cherry jam, truffles, incense, licorice, and raspberries. Full-bodied with a stunningly rich, concentrated mouthfeel, an explosive mid-palate, and a finish that lasts more than a minute, it is a wine of superb power and intensity admirably displaying the terroir’s hallmark delicacy and ethereal nature. This utterly profound Chateauneuf du Pape should drink beautifully for 25+ years. "
3274,Sloan Proprietary Red,2008,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,579,14.8,0.0,0,"I am loving the structure to this wine. Exotic fruit with flowers, and lots going on. The tannins are very velvety, and have a super refined texture and a long, long finish. A fascinating wine. "
3275,Abreu Vineyards Madrona Ranch,2008,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,459,0,0.0,0,"The 2008 Madrona Ranch opens with an incredibly expressive bouquet. Espresso, mocha and licorice meld into dark red fruit and sweet exotic spices in this superb wine. The 2008 is an extraordinarily polished, refined wine for the vintage. Sweet spiced and floral notes reappear to round out the finish. The relatively high percentage of Cabernet Franc (37%) comes through in spades here. The blend is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 4% Merlot. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2033. "
3276,Geoffroy Rose de Saignee,Brut,Sparkling Rosé,France,79,12.5,3.9,12,"Derived from the 2013 vintage and disgorged in March 2019, the latest release of Geoffroy's NV Extra-Brut Rosé de Saignée Blanc de Rose is showing nicely, offering up scents of crisp apple, rye toast, red berries and cherries. Medium to full-bodied, chiseled and precise, it's seamless and textural, with a notably elegant, fine-boned profile by the standards of this habitually vinous, broad-shouldered cuvée. A dense rosé Champagne with strawberry fruit and mineral undertones, as well as cooked peaches. Full-bodied with lots of fruit and a spicy finish. Minerally, too. 100% pinot noir. Packs an aromatic skein of herbes de Provence and spice box, which wind through flavors of macerated raspberry, blood orange peel, oyster shell and almond skin. A firm, well-knit rosé Champagne, lightly chalky in texture and mouthwatering through the zesty finish. Disgorged March 2022. "

3278,M. Chapoutier Ermitage Le Meal Blanc,2008,Marsanne,France,219,0,0.0,0,"One of the coolest vintages in the decade, the 2008 Ermitage le Meal Blanc is a serious, full-bodied, ripe and textured beauty that has lively acidity in its honeyed fruits, buttered-citrus and caramel aromas and flavors. Defying the vintage stereotype and possessing ample ripeness and depth, it won't be as long-lived as some of the bigger, richer vintages, but will still drink beautifully for another 15-20 years. Gorgeous Jonagold apple and Cavaillon melon aromas and flavors form the core of this wine, while quinine, candied lemon peel, cherry blossom, quince and green fig notes all fill in the background and drive through the well-detailed finish. Best from 2011 through 2018. This 100% Marsanne comes from a 2ha plot of 50-year-old vines on alluvial deposits and large stones. 2008 was a fairly average vintage in the Rhône, arguably the worst of the 2000s along with the dire 2002, but the whites are better than the reds, as this wine shows. It's a little skinnier and straighter than average, but still thoroughly enjoyable, with a little touch of vanilla pod to the poached pear and mango flavours. It has vibrant acidity and a more bitter finish than usual. Not a great vintage for this wine, but from a global perspective it's still very good. Drinking Window 2019 - 2023 "

An explosively perfumed bouquet displays red and dark berry preserves, potpourri, licorice and smoky minerals. Broad and fleshy, offering deeply concentrated black raspberry and bitter cherry flavors and a strong note of floral pastilles. Chewy tannins give grip to a powerful, alluringly sweet, endless finish. Shows as much density as I can recall from a young Rayas and is clearly built for the long haul. "
3280,Sine Qua Non The Gorgeous Victim Grenache (1.5 Liter Magnum),2017,Grenache,California,939,15.7,0.0,0,"The 2017 Grenache The Gorgeous Victim (first tasted last year as a barrel sample and before it had been named) is composed of 76% Grenache, 10% Mourvèdre, 9% Syrah, 3.8% Petit Sirah and 1.2% Viognier. The vineyard sources are: are 46% Cumulus Estate, 29% Eleven Confessions Estate, 6% Molly Aida Estate, 17% The Third Twin Estate and 2% Bien Nacido Vineyard. It was aged for around 23 months in 23% new French oak, 48% used oak (various sizes) and 29% concrete. Forty-six percent (mainly Grenache) was fermented using whole clusters. Deep garnet-purple in color, this wine has a very serious nose of game, fertile soil, crushed rocks and new leather over a wonderfully pure, well-defined core of crushed black cherries and ripe blackberries with wafts of unsmoked cigars and Sichuan pepper. "
3281,Rhys Vineyards Alpine Vineyard Pinot Noir,2009,Pinot Noir,California,149,13.1,0.0,0,Here the nose is similar to that of the Skyline but with more obvious spice notes that carry over to the exceptionally rich and large-scaled flavors that possess very firm and ripe tannins that coat the mouth yet are not aggressive or drying. This very serious effort is not as refined as the Skyline but it is just as complex and a lot more powerful. 
3282,Rudd Oakville Estate Proprietary Red (1.5 Liter Magnum),2009,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,429,0,0.0,0,"The estate's 2009 Proprietary Red Rudd Estate wraps around the palate with silky dark fruit. Layered, sweet and sensual, the 2009 is laced with attractive scents of mocha, cloves and violets, all of which add complexity to the dark fruit. The 2009 needs a few years to soften, but ultimately it stands out for its textured personality and terrific balance. This undeniably appealing wine is likely to be at its best over the next 10-15 years, give or take. Anticipated maturity: 2014-2029. "

3284,Chateau de Beaucastel Chateauneuf-du-Pape (1.5 Liter Magnum),1989,Rhone Red Blends,France,649,0,0.0,0,"This is a floral and elegantly complex edition of this wine with dried meat and leather, iron and graphite, tobacco and dry spices. More elegant palate than the 1990, it has a very fine stream of red fruit and spiced cherries and a central, linear focus. The flavors hold so very long, deeply concentrated and focused. The fruit livens up at the finish and opens very impressively. Drink now. Perhaps the greatest Beaucastel ever produced. Has the class and structure of a great vintage of Mouton-Rothschild. Deep, inky in color, with intense herb, plum, game and spice aromas, this full-bodied wine has an explosion of fruit and an iron backbone. The 1989 is inkier/purple in color than the 1990, with an extraordinarily sweet, rich personality offering up notes of smoke, melted licorice, black cherries, Asian spices, and cassis. Full-bodied and concentrated, it is one of the most powerful as well as highly extracted Beaucastels I have ever tasted "
3285,Parusso Barolo Mosconi,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,169,15,0.0,0,"Wow. This is a super-sensual Barolo with wild black-fruit character, such as ripe elderberries and dried dates. Fresher notes of blood oranges, too. Balanced vanilla edge to the palate that coats the firm, grainy tannins and carries the creamy fruit through the long finish. Super-succulent and enticing. To produce this in 2018 is a real achievement. Hats off to the winemaking. So tempting even now, but will only improve.  Vibrant red and orange rim to the glass. Lovely fruit and savoury aspects - the dried flower aromas are so abundant but they're edged with deep and seductive red fruit nuances too. It's soft and delicate on the nose yet so expressive and rich. Generous aromatics, with cola cube aspects. Grippy from the start, the tannins here make an immediate impression coating the mouth and giving structure to the rich, seductive cherry, strawberry and raspberry fruits. The tannins are so well integrated though, soft, plump, slightly chewy and really lovely in their texture. This is well rounded but with a precise and quite deep core. Lots going on here with a real lingering depth of cherry, coffee and stone. Feels mature and sophisticated and more expansive in the mouth than the Mariondino. The Parusso 2018 Barolo Mosconi shows that distinctively stemmy element that I always associate with these wines so carefully made by Marco Parusso and his family. The bouquet is firm and powerful with dried cherry, steeped Darjeeling tea and persimmon. The wine is extra solid, both in terms of structure and tannins, and it follows up with an ample 15% alcohol content. Best After 2025 "
3286,Chateau Rayas Pignan Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2009,Grenache,France,929,0,0.0,0,"The 2009 Pignan Chateauneuf du Pape is one of the strongest examples of this wine I have tasted in recent years. This medium to dark ruby-hued offering exhibits glorious, sweet notes of strawberry and black cherry jam intermixed with nori (the seaweed wrapper used in sushi restaurants), licorice, lavender and incense. Deep, full-bodied and supple textured, this 1,000-case cuvee is already irresistible. "
3287,Guigal Cote Rotie La Turque,2004,Syrah/Shiraz,France,379,0,0.0,0,"Saturated red. Deep, concentrated aromas of kirsch, cola and blackcurrant, with mounting smokiness and Indian spice qualities. Livelier on the palate, offering sweet raspberry and cherry-cola flavors, velvety texture and a strong lashing of cracked pepper. A sweet anise note carries through the sappy, very sweet finish. This wine is already quite seductive. Still tight, but with an ample core of hoisin sauce, licorice, black currant preserve and espresso. There's great length and lovely texture through the finish, which is filled with dark plum, cocoa and iron. While certainly an outstanding wine, the 2004 Cote Rotie la Turque is a more streamlined, medium-bodied, elegant example of this cuvee. It offers a touch of herbacousness as well as lots of smoked meats, coffee bean and truffle, ripe tannin and solid overall balance. While outstanding, the 2004 Côte Rôtie La Turque is probably my least favorite vintage in the past 20 years or more. Medium-bodied, elegant, and streamlined on the palate, it has classy notes of smoked meats, green herbs, coffee bean, and truffle. "
3288,Domaine Bernard Gripa Saint-Joseph Rouge,2019,Syrah/Shiraz,France,55,0,0.0,0,"The base 2019 Saint Joseph is terrific stuff, and I’d love to have case in the cellar. Medium to full-bodied, pure, and elegant, it’s not a blockbuster and leans on its purity, perfect balance, and silky tannins. All Syrah from steep, granite slopes around Mauves and Tournon that was partially destemmed and aged in a mix of barrels, it makes the most of this great vintage and can be enjoyed any time over the coming 10-15 years. Lavished in vanilla, the creamy, hedonistic 2019 Saint Joseph layers that with ripe cherries to make a delectable, easy-drinking wine. It's medium to full-bodied, lush and rich, with a long, velvety finish. I realize the oak may put off some traditionalists, but this appears to have excellent underlying material and is worth following. "
3289,Rhys Vineyards Home Vineyard Pinot Noir,2012,Pinot Noir,California,139,13,0.0,0,"The wood treatment is more obvious though it remains subtle as it allows the notably ripe aromas of plum, dark chocolate, dried flowers and essence of black cherry to shine. There is a sleek mouth feel to the voluminous and beautifully detailed flavors that possess fine mid-palate concentration and really lovely depth and length. The intensity does a slow build from the mid-palate to the beautifully long finale and about the only nit is a discreet hint of warmth. "
3290,Ridge Monte Bello,1995,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,419,12.5,0.0,0,"The product of a late-October harvest, the 1995 vintage was Eric Baugher's first vintage as Ridge's winemaker alongside Paul Draper, and I remember him telling me in 2012 that he was afraid extraction had been pushed too far and that the wine might always be somewhat monolithic. In the last three years, however, the 1995 Monte Bello has began to shed some of its formidable tannins, and it's clear that those fears were unfounded. The nose offers up rich aromas of cassis and red plums that mingle with nuances of sweet, loamy soil, cigar box and subtle leather. On the palate, the 1995 is full-bodied, deep and super concentrated, with its powerful core of fruit framed by melting tannins and underpinned by tangy acids, concluding with a long and distinctly stony finish. Today, the 1995 ranks as one of the highlights of the decade. Think of it as a somewhat more rustic cousin of the 2005. It's a blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc that attained 12.5% natural alcohol. "
3291,Kunstler Rheingau Estate Riesling Trocken,2019,Riesling,Germany,25,12.5,0.0,0,"Plenty of peach and grapefruit in this generous, but lively dry riesling, the spritz lifting the finish very nicely. "
3292,La Cigarrera Manzanilla Sherry (375ML,half-bottle),Sherry,Spain,15,15,3.2,12,"Very fresh, with a lively fleur de sel note that pierces the mix of quinine, chamomile, white peach and dried lemon peel flavors. The long, pure finish is bony and mouthwatering. "
3293,"Continuum with Commemorative ""One Hundredth Harvest"" Booklet (375ML half-bottle)",2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,149,14.7,0.0,0,"Blackberries, dark wet soil and blackcurrants. Graphite, too. So aromatic. Pure fruit. Full-bodied with superbly polished, fine tannins that draw you down through the center of palate. Extremely layered and the texture is so curated, giving wonderful persistence. Real plushness and fine, velvety texture. 50% cabernet sauvignon, 37% cabernet franc, 7% petit verdot and 6% merlot. Better after 2026. "
3294,Paolo Scavino Barolo Bricco Ambrogio,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,79,15,0.0,0,"An attractive nose, with dense floral notes to color the ripe red berries and cherries. Hints of white nuts and apricot skins add to the appeal. The same enticing fruit mix on the palate, too, with an easy bed of fine but loosely knit tannin that adds a luxurious note to the mouth-feel. All in all, this is quite an extravagant Barolo with loads to like now, but should age gracefully.  With fruit from Roddi, the 2018 Barolo Bricco Ambrogio is open-knit and broad, and its aromas focus on dark fruit, ripe cherry and plum. This vintage does not have the extreme aromatic definition that we saw in past vintages, but it delivers a long and polished mouthfeel nonetheless. Best After 2024 "
3295,Matthieu Barret Cornas Brise Cailloux,2019,Syrah/Shiraz,France,67,0,0.0,0,"Extremely vibrant and fresh, this Cornas has a hyper-real quality, in the positive sense of the word, and it already gives so much pleasure. Very clean and precise at the wet-stone finish. From bio-dynamically grown grapes. Drink now. "
3296,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon (1.5 Liter Magnum),2005,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,799,14.5,0.0,0,"Almost sure to raise controversy with its involving aromas of leather, roasted coffee, scorched chocolate and herbs, this unique offering smacks ever so faintly of Syrah and may not fit the fruity Cabernet model, but its complexity is beyond any argument. It is smooth and supple in feel with plenty of palatal weight and a fine sense of polish, and its neatly fit spine of firm structural tannins is precisely the stuff of fine Cabernet. A few years of age should make a good thing better, and it has room enough for ten years of growth. "

3298,Chateau Rayas Pignan Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2010,Grenache,France,899,0,0.0,0,"Bright ruby-red. Intensely perfumed red fruit and floral aromas are complicated by notes of Asian spices and minerals. Extremely fresh on the palate, offering nervy redcurrant and raspberry flavors and a strong spicy underpinning. A zesty note of blood orange comes up with air and adds a tangy edge to the long, precise, floral-accented finish. A very sexy wine that's surprisingly approachable now, especially compared to its big brother. "
3299,Arietta Variation One,2001,Other Red Blends,California,129,0,0.0,0,"A blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Syrah, the 2001 Variation One exhibits sweet, flowery, blackberry and cassis flavors with chocolate and leather in the background. This big, full-bodied, opulent, layered, multidimensional 2001 needs 2-3 years of cellaring. It should drink well for 1-2 decades. "
3300,Verite La Joie,2014,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,409,13.8,0.0,0,"A Cabernet-dominated blend, La Joie reveals a classic bouquet of crushed cassis, wild plum, pencil shavings, wood smoke and a subtle framing of toasty oak. On the palate the wine is powerful, framed by firm but fine tannins and underpinned by a tensile line of acidity. It's the most structured and powerful of the Vérité wines, sapid and serious. Aromas of lead pencil, graphite and hot slate. Blackcurrants, too. Full-bodied, very tight and tannic. Linear and driven on the finish. Very fresh and energized. Racy and focused. Primarily cabernet sauvignon. Needs three to four years to come around completely. Try in 2021. "
3301,Parusso Barolo Mariondino,2018,Nebbiolo,Italy,139,15,0.0,0,"The Parusso 2018 Barolo Mariondino is a bigger and more concentrated wine compared to the Perarmando. With fruit from Castiglione Falletto, it also has what tastes like riper, darker and more fleshed-out fruit flavors. This wine delivers lots of power (with 15% alcohol), stems, structure and large-scale tannins, as expected. It's a lot to take in. Best After 2024 A medium-bodied Barolo with pretty easygoing wild-strawberry and fine-tannin style. Compact and tight, this is tempting even now, but give it another year. Light orange red color in the glass. Unusual but super expressive nose, really fragrant cherry notes, delicately perfumed, but so distinct - like potpourri, dried flowers with touches of cola and caramel. Precise and driven on the palate, certainly with a distinct coffee, cherry stone flavor. Good acidity, juicy, mouthwatering and incredibly fresh - freshly picked strawberries and cherries - but it's the savory touch with a real mineral stone cleanliness that grips the tongue and takes hold that is so captivating. Lovely depth on the mid palate, quite a driven style but very linear, direct and taught at the moment. More savory than overtly fruity. Super elegant. "
3302,Rhys Vineyards Horseshoe Vineyard Pinot Noir,2009,Pinot Noir,California,109,13.3,0.0,0,"The 2009 Pinot Noir Horseshoe Vineyard is the most virile wine in this lineup. Black cherries, mint, iron and crushed rocks come together in this dramatic, generous Pinot. The fleshiness of the fruit nearly covers the tannins, but they are lurking beneath the wine’s considerable fleshiness. Menthol, pine and a host of other dark, balsamic notes wrap around the insistent, powerful finish. Exhibits enticing hot brick and earthy traits, with a dense core of beefy dried berry, black tea, white pepper and cedar, holding its focus and ending long and persistent. Should reward cellaring. "
3303,Rhys Vineyards Horseshoe Vineyard Syrah,2011,Syrah/Shiraz,California,79,12.9,0.0,0,"A step back from the bigger, richer 2012, the 2011 Syrah Horseshoe Vineyard has classic Cote Rotie-like notes of pepper, green olive tapenade, smoked meats and sweet currant and blackberry-style fruits. Medium to full-bodied, layered and seamless, with juicy, tangy acidity, it has solid mid-palate concentration, loads of charm... "
3304,Cinnabar Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay,2019,Chardonnay,California,39,14.1,0.0,0,"Grapefruit peel, chiseled stone, light jasmine and hints of guava show on the nose of this bottling. Linear flavors of lime peel and lemon pith are framed by a white-stone minerality on the palate. "
3305,Weingut OTT Riesling,2017,Riesling,Austria,41,12.5,4.1,13,"Tender and subtle but supremely fresh green lemon notes mark the nose of this wine. That bright, taut and zesty lemon theme carries on, pervading the entire slender palate. It's concentrated, lip-smacking and simply so moreish. A lively dry riesling with as much mandarin and nectarine aromas as freshness. This is very appealing with a crisp, dry finish. From biodynamically grown grapes. Respekt certified. "
3306,Chateau Latour (1.5 Liter Magnum),2009,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"2,999",13.5,0.0,0,"Deep garnet colored, the 2009 Latour is unashamedly youthful with bold blackcurrants, black cherries and warm plums notes plus nuances of cedar chest, aniseed, beef drippings, truffles and tapenade with a waft of tilled black soil. Full, concentrated and powerful in the mouth, it has a rock-solid frame of super ripe, grainy tannins and fantastic freshness, finishing very long and wonderfully minerally. Just a baby—this needs time! Dark and chocolatey with a lot of richness, but also a cool herbal freshness this is a very impressive Medoc wine that's already delicious to drink. Very long, surprisingly supple finish for this château. A perfect wine. Drink or hold. This seems to come full circle, with a blazing iron note and mouthwatering acidity up front leading to intense, vibrant cassis, blackberry and cherry skin flavors that course along, followed by the same vivacious minerality that started things off. The tobacco, ganache and espresso notes seem almost superfluous right now, but they'll join the fray in due time. The question is, can you wait long enough? "
3307,Chateau Petrus,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"4,699",14.5,0.0,0,"The 2018 Petrus has retained its opaque purple-black color after bottling, foreshadowing the seemingly frozen-in-time glacial pace at which this wine is proceeding. It opens very reluctantly, requiring considerable air with vigorous swirling and doggedly demands a few hours before it offers glimpses at this slumbering giant of a wine. As it eventually unfurls, it slowly morphs into a powerful, fantastically pure nose of preserved plums, blackberry preserves and blueberry compote, followed by nuances of molten licorice, dark chocolate, black truffles, iron ore and, still later, floral notions of lilacs and rose oil come through. The full-bodied palate is taut, muscular and oh-so-tightly wound at this stage, revealing peeks at many, many layers of perfectly ripe black and blue fruits, exotic spices and earthy notions for which words simply fail. Clear flesh to the plump damson fruits, alongside grilled caramel, graphite, cassis bud and cocoa bean. The tannins are plentiful, but they are plush, ripe and flexible, and as such are full of Pomerol signature. As it opens through the palate, you realise just how much grip and persistency there is, and the more serious side asserts itself, with bitter cocoa shavings and fresh acidities. A more approachable Petrus at this early stage than in many years, but the kick is there and this is getting set for the long term. 50% new oak. Bottled in July after two months in vat following end of barrel ageing. Drinking Window 2026 - 2048 Plush and inviting, with steeped red and black currant and fig flavors that meld nicely with fruitcake, Christmas pudding and anise notes through the finish. Subtle dark earth hint at the end keeps it grounded. The vintage's slightly austere edge is here, but is minimized by the fruit, helping this stand apart from the pack. Best from 2023 through 2034. "

But in 2018, it's an especially big, dense, powerful wine with masses of inky colour, assertive one-third new oak, plenty of plush bramble and black cherry fruit, undertones of sweet spices and liquorice and a chalky flourish. Needs time. A huge, deep, inkily black colour with some cooked fruit on the nose. Solid, massive ungiving. Really hard to judge at this stage because so monolithic. Will it emerge later on? Maybe. "
3310,Freemark Abbey Bosche Cabernet Sauvignon,1995,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,175,13.8,0.0,0,"Healthy dark red to the rim. Sexy, complex nose combines plum, currant, spices, oak char, coffee and sweet butter. Sweet, energetic and clearly delineated, with its dark cherry, spice and licorice flavors lifted by a floral topnote. Still a bit tight, but I doubt this will loosen up further. Finishes with excellent length. This very fresh, juicy midweight wine displays saline soil complexity and noteworthy finishing lift. "
3311,Jean-Louis Chave Hermitage Blanc,1999,Rhone White Blends,France,439,0,0.0,0,"The 1999 Hermitage blanc is a glorious effort. It is a 1,000-case blend of 80% Marsanne and 20% Roussanne, all from Les Rocoules, Maison Blanche, l'Ermite, and Peleat. It is an oily, unctuously-textured wine with low acidity, fabulous, concentrated, honeysuckle, citrus, liquid mineral, and acacia flower-like flavors. The finish lasts for nearly 45 seconds. It will be gorgeous young, but evolve for two decades or more. "
3312,Gaja Costa Russi,2009,Nebbiolo,Italy,495,14.5,0.0,0,"The overt fruit and depth typical of Costa Russi comes through in spades in the 2009. Plums, black cherries, chocolate and new leather form the core of this round, expressive Costa Russi. As beautiful as this is, the 2009 remains deeply marked by the vintage. There is plenty of beauty and richness in the glass, but not quite the sheer visceral thrill of the very best Costa Russis. Although I wouldn't open any of the 2009 single-vineyard wines in the near-term, the Costa Russi is the most expressive of the three. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2029. Wonderful aromas of crushed cherries, peaches, and ripe strawberries follow through to a full body, with chewy tannins and a mineral and floral aftertaste. Perfumed and pure, this red delivers floral, berry and spice flavors on a harmonious frame. There's a touch of licorice as this tightens up on the finish. "
3313,Pride Mountain Vineyards Reserve Claret,2007,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,179,15,0.0,0,"The two most expensive offerings include the 2007 Reserve Claret. Its opaque purple color is followed by a beautiful flowery nose revealing notions of blueberry pie, blackberries, cassis and a hint of vanillin in the background. An opulent, full-bodied red with great depth, purity and richness, it is a blend of 82% Sonoma fruit and 18% Napa fruit. The texture is like a skyscraper and the wine is plush, opulent... Rich, lush and complex, with red currant and toasty bitter mocha aromas that lead to layered black raspberry, anise and fresh earthy loam flavors. The tannins are big but fleshy. Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. This is a big, hard, tannic wine. It’s so buttoned up, the question is whether it will age. Most of the signs say yes. It’s gigantically rich in blackberries, cassis and chocolate, with a berried sweetness accented by the caramel of toasted oak. Acidity is just fine. On the other hand, the alcohol is notable, giving it peppery heat. "
3314,Levy & McClellan Proprietary Red,2006,Other Red Blends,California,349,0,0.0,0,"The 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon displays beautifully sweet blue and black fruits intermixed with espresso roast, smoked meats, chocolate, and scorched earth. Dense purple in color, deep, rich, broad, with plenty of tannin and concentration as well as noticeable oak, this wine is a massive Cabernet meant for long-term cellaring. I wouldn’t touch a bottle for 6 to 8 years, then watch it unfold over the following 25-30. "

The medium to full-bodied palate is chock-full of muscular black fruits, delivering compelling vivacity and tension, framed by velvety tannin's and finishing epically long and perfumed. The intense, bright, energetic fruit on this 2018 has been impeccably preserved. Stunning! Beautiful all the way, the deep purple hued 2018 Château Clos Fourtet comes from one of the prized terroirs on the upper limestone plateau, just outside the village of Saint-Emilion. The blend is 90% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc, and the balance Cabernet Sauvignon, brought up in 60% new French oak. Gorgeous minerality as well as cassis and ripe black cherry fruits emerge from this full-bodied 2018 that has lots of tobacco and spice-driven aromatics, again, an almost searing minerality, beautiful overall balance, and ripe, building tannins. It benefits from air if opening bottles anytime soon, and it’s going to benefit from 3-5 years of bottle age and cruise for two decades in cold cellars. Beautiful blueberries and black cherries with crushed-stone and limestone notes. Juniper, too. It’s full-bodied, yet so linear and energetic with focused, fine tannins. Fresh acidity. Really fine-grained tannins here. Drink after 2025. Juicy, winey and very compact in feel, with racy acidity and chalky minerality imbedded deeply in the core of sleek cassis, bitter cherry and damson plum flavors. Nice flecks of savory and dried anise dot the finish, where everything echoes nicely. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2024 through 2038. "

3324,Bonneau du Martray Corton Grand Cru,2015,Pinot Noir,France,359,13,0.0,0,"The 2015 Corton Grand Cru from Bonneau du Martray, the most impressive young red wine that I've ever encountered from this storied domaine, wafts from the glass with a lovely bouquet of ripe red berries and coniferous forest floor, framed by creamy new oak. On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, sapid and silky, its core of beautifully vibrant fruit cloaking its ripe but chalky tannins. While this Corton is a touch less austere and linear than usual, it has lost none of its precision and delicacy. Cropped at 25 hectoliters per hectare. "

3326,Pride Mountain Vineyards Reserve Claret,2004,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,139,14.7,0.0,0,"70% Merlot; 30% Cabernet Sauvignon. Deep, dense and highly extracted with layer upon layer of caramel, vanilla and sweet toast overlying its considerable currant and cherry-like fruit, this potent young wine has lots in reserve despite being very showy right now.  It is very much a wine for the future and finishes with the kind of grabby Cabernet tannins that will take time to resolve. While we urge at least five years of patience, we can easily see it improving for ten or more. The strength of the 2005 vintage at Pride is again noticeable when one compares some of the lower level Cabernet Sauvignons with the 2004 Reserve Claret. While the latter wine (89% from Sonoma and 11% from Napa) is outstanding, it is not as good as the less expensive 2005 Cabernets. "
3327,Rhys Vineyards Family Farm Vineyard Pinot Noir,2009,Pinot Noir,California,89,13.4,0.0,0,"The 2009 Pinot Noir Family Farm is one of the more delicate, ethereal wines in the lineup. Fermentation with 100% whole clusters gives the Family Farm a distinctly floral bouquet and graceful fruit. It is an impeccably elegant wine from start to finish. Distinct floral and spice notes add nuance to the elegant and airy red berry fruit aromas that lead to rich, supple and forward middle weight flavors that possess fine detail and purity to the delicious and beautifully long finish. Among the Rhys wines, the Family Farm and Skyline Vineyards are those which are built more along the lines of finesse than power. "
3328,Alban Seymour's Vineyard Syrah,1999,Syrah/Shiraz,California,219,0,0.0,0,"There are 150 cases of the 1999 Syrah Seymour's Vineyard. It reveals an opaque purple color along with a classic Syrah nose of blackberry and cassis intermixed with toasty oak, bacon fat, and vanilla. Full-bodied, layered, rich, dense and smoky. "
3329,Freemark Abbey Bosche Cabernet Sauvignon,2005,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,129,14.1,0.0,0,"From a 23-acre vineyard planted on the so-called red Rutherford dust, the 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon Bosche Vineyard is a blend of 91% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Merlot. While it does not reach the level of some past legends (1974), it reveals a sumptuous perfume of creme de cassis, loamy soil, and spicy oak, followed by tightly-constructed, medium to full-bodied flavors with sweet tannin, outstanding concentration, and admirable overall equilibrium. While it still plays it close to the vest, its quality/pedigree is obvious. Consume it over the next 15+ years. "
3330,Rhys Vineyards Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay,2009,Chardonnay,California,99,13,0.0,0,"The 2009 Chardonnay Santa Cruz Mountains is made from declassified barrels from the Horseshoe and Alpine vineyards. It is a round, textured wine endowed with gorgeous aromatic complexity and fine balance. This is a rather soft, seamless style that emphasizes the accessibility of the fruit over the more prominent minerality that is found in some of the estate's other wines. "
3331,Rene Rostaing Cote-Rotie Cote Blonde,2001,Syrah/Shiraz,France,269,0,0.0,0,"This has started to drop its primary fruit, giving way to dried cherry, tobacco, pepper and olive notes, with a long, sanguine finish.

3332,Bacio Divino Proprietary Red,1996,Other Red Blends,California,99,13.5,0.0,0,"A terrific offering from this producer, the 1996 Bacio Divino (a blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Sangiovese, 9% Petite Sirah, and 8% Merlot) offers a spicy, oaky nose with notions of jammy cassis, strawberries, and cherries. Full-bodied and complex, with a dominant black fruit element upstaging the new oak nuances, this is a fleshy, ostentatious, pure, gorgeously seductive wine. Kudos to wine-maker/proprietor Claus Janzen. "

The Curmudgeon boasts extraordinary aromatic intensity and deep layers of fruit, which makes it one of the best wines in the range. The 2014 The Curmudgeon Proprietary Red, 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of his smaller cuvées of only 132 cases. The wine is soft, round, juicy, and has essentially a near-perfect fragrance of flowers and blue and black fruits, but unusual for a Russell Bevan, the aromatics eclipse the palate impression with aggressive tannin and a slightly angular, austere character. This stands out – especially in the company of the rest of the otherworldly products he has produced. This is still an outstanding wine and it may come further together over the next 10-15 years. "

Salmon-orange color with aromas of raspberries, red apples, grapefruit zest, toasted hazelnuts and biscuits. Medium-bodied with sharp, vibrant acidity. Fine bubbles. Fresh and energetic. Dry feel. Drink now. This disgorgement of the NV Cuvée des Moines Brut Rosé is from September 2017 and is (probably) based on the 2014 vintage. The salmon colored wine leads to a delicate, fresh and vinous nose with intense red fruit and floral aromas and a refined chalkiness.

Gorgeous on the palate as well, it shows a medium to full-bodied, incredibly seamless style carrying polished tannins, a layered, elegant mouthfeel, good overall freshness (I'm sure the acidity is low), and a great finish.

The wine continues to unfold and evolve on the palate, offering complex terroir expressions. Concluding with a long, drawn-out and persistent finish, flavors of dusty citrus linger for more than a minute. There’s no wonder why these wines are so highly allocated and sought after.

3363,Giesen The Brothers Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (375ML half-bottle),2013,Other Dessert,Zealand,38,10,3.7,14,"Thick, unctuous and impressive, this is one seriously sweet Sauvignon Blanc. Honey and bergamot notes mark the nose, while the palate features more citrus and folds in hints of pineapple as well. Long and sticky on the finish. The team at Giesen farmed two estate vineyard blocks without spraying, to encourage botrytis, then netted the vines to allow the fruit to hang protected from the birds. This is a big, honeyed wine in 2013, its concentrated apricot and lemon richness spiced by botrytis, with enough freshness to keep the sweetness in check. It finishes firm, juicy and clean, dessert on its own or with fresh peaches next summer. Peach cobbler, vanilla and spice flavors mingle together on a smooth and juicy frame, with candied lemon peel, hazelnut and chai tea accents on the finish. Drink now through 2030. "

It comes in with 97 grams per liter of residual sugar. In this tough year, this is pretty nice, one of my happiest finds in Port. The fruit is wonderful (which is more than many can say) and it is simply delicious on opening, if seeming to lack a bit of power. If it is not the most concentrated or powerful VP ever, the next day it showed more seriously, lacking the initial flamboyance and fruitiness, but finishing with focus and precision. It has classic Port flavors. It adds great aromatics and a juicy, lifted finish. This should be approachable relatively young and it will be interesting to see if it is a long-term ager, but it is still Port and it should hold reasonably well. If it develops well, it may even be entitled to an uptick. Enticing, with a relatively high-pitched açaí and blueberry core that lets violet, menthol and star anise notes fill in easily. The floral edge stays prominent through the finish. Best from 2020 through 2035. "

This shows richness with structure. Excellent 2017. Try after 2023. A dry wine firm with dark tannins, this is destined for long aging. Concentration and a solid structure are balanced by the dusty texture and dry core. It will take a while for the potential of the juicy black fruits to come through, so this wine needs to wait until 2024. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 4% Petit Verdot and 4% Cabernet Franc, the 2017 Chateau Haut-Bailly spent 16 months in 50% new French oak. It reveals a medium ruby hue as well as a classic, medium-bodied, elegant yet also ripe style that's common in the vintage. With medium body, ripe, polished tannins, beautiful elegance and purity, and a great finish, it's a terrific wine in the vintage that will drink well for 25-30 years. A bold tarry note coils around the core of plum, black currant and blackberry fruit, while licorice root and bramble details check in on the finish. Packed and grippy, this is a touch rustic in profile at this early stage but should unwind easily enough with time, as all the pieces are in place. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2023 through 2038. "

The tannins are equally imposing. Today the wine comes across as painfully young, but the Reserve has a track record of aging beautifully in bottle, so it will be interesting to see where the 2008 goes over the coming years. Sweet mint, new leather and licorice are some of the nuances that add complexity on the focused, articulate finish. Anticipated maturity: 2018-2028. Intense and at points rustic and chewy, full-bodied and dense, with complex, firm and tannic, giving the dark berry flavors a dry savory edge. Rambles over rough terrain, yet remains complex and alluring. Best from 2013 through 2023. "

Sleek and intense, building to a long, spice- and sandalwood-infused aftertaste. Best from 2024 through 2042. 20 cases imported. The 2016 Mazoyères-Chambertin Grand Cru is the darkest of four wines tasted from this vineyard. It has a very seductive bouquet with pure dark cherry and plummy fruit, some high quality new oak that is neatly enmeshed. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent ripe tannins, well-judged acidity, perhaps more modern in style than its peers, but you cannot deny the precision, the delineation and mineralité in the finish. Great persistence here, a Mazoyères with pedigree. Tasted blind at the 2016 Burgfest tasting. "

Surprisingly soft tannins are atypical for this vintage, but they work well and frame this full-bodied, concentrated, multidimensional wine. One of the finest Sloans made to date, it can be drunk now or cellared for 25-30 years. This has the fresh blackcurrants and blackberries of the vintage with a lot of savory and some balsamic notes. Rich and concentrated but fresh and energetic with full, velvety tannins that make for a stunning balance. The finish has breathtaking freshness that kicks it way down the road. Drink or hold. "
3373,Rhys Vineyards Rhys Swan Terrace Pinot Noir,2008,Pinot Noir,California,139,0,0.0,0,"This is also gorgeously layered and brilliantly complex with a stunning nose of rose petal, violet, red and blue pinot fruit and perhaps the most overt mineral-influence of any wine in the group and this aspect can also be found on the beautifully textured, refined and pure flavors that are an exercise in balance and harmony. In sum, a wine of class and grace that in 10 years may ultimately prove to be as good as the Horseshoe. "
3374,Egly-Ouriet Grand Cru Brut,2013,Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,799,0,0.0,0,"Francis Egly has produced another profound Champagne with the 2013 Brut Grand Cru Millésime. If the monumental 2008 stands out for its power, structure and intensity, the 2013 is distinguished by its harmony, finesse and completeness; both vintages are very great wines but thus quite different in style. Wafting from the glass with scents of Anjou pear, crisp yellow apple, freshly baked bread, clear honey, iodine and fresh mint, it's full-bodied, ample and pillowy, with a layered, concentrated and effortlessly balanced core of fruit, uniting precision and sensuality to compelling effect. Girdled by racy acids and animated by a delicate pinpoint mousse, it concludes with a long, penetrating finish. Is this the most elegant wine Egly has produced to date? It's certainly among the most compelling that this high quality but initially underrated Champagne vintage has delivered. "

Pliant red fruit flavors are deepened by candied licorice and bitter chocolate, with bright acidity adding lift.

3380,Verite La Muse,2015,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,409,14.7,0.0,0,"This is dense yet agile young red with aromas and flavors of blackberries, black olives and black truffles. Full-bodied, layered and rich. Pretty ripe and melted tannins. Top merlot. Drink or hold. Composed of 90% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec, the 2015 La Muse sports a very deep garnet-purple color, leaping from the glass with exuberant crème de cassis, blueberry pie and licorice notes plus suggestions of Indian spices, dark chocolate, menthol, sautéed herbs and potpourri. Full-bodied, rich and seductive in the mouth, it delivers tons of black and blue fruit preserves flavors, accented by exotic spices, framed with velvety tannins and finishing on a persistent earthy/mineral note. 3,900 cases were made. "
3381,Contino Garnacha,2015,Grenache,Spain,51,0,0.0,0,"The aim for the 2015 Garnacha was to get a floral and fresh wine from early-harvested grapes. They fermented in an oak vat and matured in second and third use, 400- and 500-liter oak barrels for one year, transferred to well-seasoned, neutral 225- and 500-liter barrels to complete 20 months in oak. It has the red fruit of Garnacha and the power, but it doesn't have great complexity. It's still young, though. There is good freshness, but it could do with a little more depth. "

A majority of the crop comes rom Gabrielskloof estate. It has an attractive cranberry and raspberry bouquet with a pinch of white pepper. The 50% new oak is neatly assimilated. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, good structure and backbone that lends it a pleasing austerity, but then it fans out on the finish with exuberant blackberry and iodine notes. It's a punchy, muscular wine, one that is well made. "

Firm, tight, edgy and backwards, with good acidity and a medium to full-bodied, structured palate, this smoking Pinot Noir needs short-term cellaring, but will be long-lived. "
3387,Sloan Proprietary Red,2012,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,569,0,0.0,0,"Owned by the Chinese Pan family, but still featuring Michel Rolland as its winemaking consultant, the 2012 Proprietary Red Blend Sloan has turned out beautifully. The vintage gives it a precocious silkiness that is atypical. A blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it showcases this fabulous terroir on the steep hillsides of the Vaca mountains, behind the luxury resort of Auberge du Soleil. The 2012 offers up beautiful notes of blueberries, blackberries, cedarwood, graphite, espresso, licorice and chocolate along with copious quantities of glycerin and fruit. This is a big, surprisingly savory and fleshy effort from Sloan that comes closest stylistically to their magnificent 2002. It can be drunk now but will be even better in 7-8 years, and should keep for 25-30 years. "

3390,Arietta Variation One,2000,Other Red Blends,California,97,0,0.0,0,"The 2000 Variation One comes from the Hudson Ranch, and is aged in 100% new oak (none of these wines could be called “oaky”). Its dense purple color is accompanied by sweet aromas of new saddle leather and roasted meats. Although monolithic, it is medium to full-bodied and intense. Given my confidence in Kongsgaard’s winemaking, it will undoubtedly reveal more “music” with 3-4 years of bottle age. A blend of 72% Merlot and 28% Syrah.  "
3391,Domaine Etienne Sauzet Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru,2011,Chardonnay,France,799,0,0.0,0,"Tasted blind, the 2011 Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru is a vintage that I omitted during my Burgundy tasting. I missed out because here it out-flanked the Montrachet from Sauzet. It has developed a complex bouquet with apple blossom, hazelnut and a soupcon of cold granite. I appreciate the drive and intensity of the Chevalier-Montrachet. The palate is lively with superb precision, offering the crescendo you expect from this vineyard. It is still primal yet there is impressive energy and nervosité that will stand it in good stead for long-term aging. This is an excellent Chevalier-Montrachet from Sauzet that should repay bottle aging.  "
3392,Artadi Vina el Pison,2007,Tempranillo,Spain,369,14,0.0,0,"The 2007 El Pison is medium purple in color with a superb, already complex nose of smoke, liquid mineral, crushed stone, lavender, balsamic, and black cherry. This leads to a beautifully proportioned, elegant, satin-textured wine with plush fruit, plenty of structure, and a lengthy, seamless finish. It can be approached now although it is still evolving and should drink well through 2027. Senor Lopez de Lacalle’s description of the 2007 is 'delicate, pure, and a wine of finesse.' "

Lovely interplay of juicy fruit and salty minerality on the light-footed and precise palate. Very delicate and gentle, long finish. Drink or hold. The 2020 Graacher Himmelreich Kabinett offers a very clear, bright and delicate bouquet with very fine slate aromas and very fine but fully ripe and even concentrated apricot aromas. Crystal clear and crystalline on the palate, with a concentrated, even slightly jammy apricot fruit core but a firm yet filigreed structure, this is an intense, very elegant and savory, irresistible Kabinett with a serious mineral structure and stimulating grip on the finish. Superb. 8.5% stated alcohol. Natural cork. "

Bright and intensely perfumed, the 2018 is strongly marked by the aromatic top notes of Zinfandel and Grenache, which lends it an incredibly appealing dimension. Sweet red/purplish fruit, spice and flowers all race out of the glass in this mid-weight, beautifully poised red. The Bouquinistes has a bit less heft than the other Coup de Foudre wines and will be especially appealing to readers who enjoy a lighter (in relative terms) style. Lots of plums and currants with chocolate, walnut and vanilla character. It’s medium-bodied with round, chewy tannins and a flavorful finish. A little tight at the end. Better after 2022. Starting with the 2018 Les Bouquinistes, this beautiful field blend reveals a ruby/purple color to go with an up-front, complex bouquet of red and black fruits, spring flowers, candied orange, and cedar pencil. Medium to full-bodied, it has a rounded, charming, supple mouthfeel, terrific overall balance, and a great finish, all making for an already delicious red blend from Napa that I would be happy to drink any time over the coming 5-7 years, if not upwards of a decade.

Dense blackberry, cedar, lead pencil shavings, cassis, espresso, white chocolate and forest floor notes are incredibly complex and inviting. Full-bodied and virtually perfect in all senses with flawlessly integrated acidity, tannin, alcohol and wood, this is a tour de force and one of the superstars of the vintage.

3401,Chateau La Mondotte,2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,279,0,0.0,0,"So much black truffle and blueberry on the nose. Decadent and aromatic. Wet soil. Indian ink. Full-bodied, polished and so velvety with fantastic depth of fruit and ripe tannins, yet powerful and fresh. Slightly minerally and salty underneath. This shows a dark, toasty style at first, with notes of ganache and plum reduction, but it unwinds steadily and slowly, revealing pure cassis, cherry and raspberry fruit flavors gilded liberally with violet and anise accents. The long finish is laced with a superfine chalky minerality that imparts mouthwa-tering cut even as the fruit gains steam. Best from 2023 through 2038. "
3402,Rhys Vineyards Skyline Vineyard Syrah,2013,Syrah/Shiraz,California,109,0,0.0,0,"The inky colored 2013 Syrah Skyline Vineyard is another northern Rhône look-alike that offers terrific notes of black and blue fruits, olive tapenade, bacon fat and smoked meats. Backwards, unevolved and concentrated, yet with beautiful fruit, it needs short-term cellaring and will keep through 2029. "

Beautiful notes of black cherries, blueberries, cured meats, pepper, tree bark, and new leather all emerge from the glass, followed by a rich, medium to full-bodied, tight, backward and unevolved Mourvèdre that needs forgotten for 4-5 years. As always, this cuvée is primarily Mourvèdre (it’s normally blended with Grenache and other varieties, even some white varieties) and there are a scant 100 cases made. While I don’t think this beauty hits the heights of the 2016, it’s still a brilliant, singular wine that will evolve for 20 years or more. "
3404,Realm Cellars Moonracer,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,369,0,0.0,0,"The 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Estate Moonracer comes from south-facing blocks on the estate in Stags Leap and is 98% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Merlot. The tannins here are a step up, and this beauty boasts a gorgeous nose of red and black fruits, tobacco leaf, violets, and spice. It’s a more elegant, medium to full-bodied, seamless wine, accurately described as an iron fist in a velvet glove by winemaker Benoit Touquette. The balance is spot on, and it has plenty of up-front appeal, yet it’s going to evolve gracefully for 20-25 years with no issues. Best After 2021 Moonracer comes exclusively from Realm’s Stags Leap estate vineyard, completely farmed by the Realm team. The blend this year is 98% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Merlot. "
3405,Chamisal Vineyards Estate Pinot Noir,2015,Pinot Noir,California,39,14.1,0.0,0,"From one of the larger estates in the Edna Valley, this wine has sweet-smelling plum, cherry candy and grenadine aromas. The palate is front-loaded with sagebrush, thyme, dried lavender and rosemary notes, while a hibiscus flavor unfolds in the background. Pale to medium ruby-purple colored, the 2015 Pinot Noir Estate is scented of raspberries, wild strawberries and lavender with hints of wild thyme and forest floor. Light to medium-bodied, with wonderful energy and tension in the mouth, it has a quiet intensity of flavors a long, chewy finish. "

Growing out of red rock at a windy elevation of 1,860 feet, the five acres of vines produce a concentrated red, this vintage bright and high-toned in its aroma, rich and full in its texture. Chunky and unevolved, it needs bottle age to show its depths. "
3407,Borgo del Tiglio Collio Studio di Bianco,2017,Other White Blends,Italy,119,14.5,0.0,0,"A blend of mostly Friulano with Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling, the green-labeled Borgo del Tiglio 2017 Collio Studio di Bianco is one of the iconic white wines of northeast Italy, with only 900 bottles released. This estate has the Midas Touch, especially when it comes to nailing that perfect balance between aromatic purity and a multidimensional, almost creamy mouthfeel. You get intensity across the board, and the blend is so carefully contemplated, no one side pulls harder than the other. Seamless balance is achieved even in a difficult vintage such as this. Orchard fruit, preserved lemon and Italian pastry crust give this wine a beautiful aromatic presentation. "

Compacted aromas of crushed currants and minerals, with roses and lilacs. Full-bodied, with masses of silky, refined tannins and a finish that lasts for minutes. Stunning. Best Latour since 1990. atour has made truly great wines in the past two decades—and this is one of the best. It has fabulous aromas of black truffles, currants, raspberry and dried flowers. Mind-blowing on the palate, it’s an emotional and soulful red. This is such an expressive wine, with elegance a major factor in its character. It is certainly huge, rich and dense. But there is much more to it. You can peel layers of fruit and tannins away, and still never get to the end of the wine’s complexity. At every stage of its life, it will reveal a new character, but for now it is dominated by powerful tannins and huge, black, fruit. Hard not to be impressed by the sheer power and muscle on display in this Latour, very much archetypal of the estate at this time, seven years into François Pinault's tenure, with the team under director Frederic Engerer (he arrived in 1995, becoming director in 1998) doing everything they could do concentrate flavours, increase precision and texture. This is beautifully layered, with truffle-laced dark chocolate, espresso, tar and tight cassis flavours and exerts a powerful grip that is clearly going nowhere over the coming decades. A little less nuanced perhaps than today's Latour but this has 3% Petit Verdot that completes the blend. 48% of the overall crop in this wine. 2000 saw a warm, dry July and August with a small amount of rain from mid-September onward. Composed of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot, the 2000 Latour has a deep garnet color and is showing a good amount of evolution, sporting mature notes of fried exotic spices, hoisin, unsmoked cigars and fruitcake with hints of incense, potpourri, cast iron pan and charcuterie. Medium-bodied, soft, plush and savory in the mouth, it has a long, mineral-tinged finish. 14,000 cases were made this year, representing 48% of production. "
3410,Daniel & Julien Barraud Pouilly-Fuisse La Roche Premier Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,54,0,0.0,0,"From a 0.75ha holding in one of the top lieux-dits in all of Pouilly-Fuissé, this has a marvellously citrusy fruit on the fresh attack. The fruit is lightly crushed and fermented in a combination of large and small casks on the lees for a year, followed by additional ageing in tank. A fantastic reference for the entire region. "
3411,Bevan Cellars De Crescenzo/Tench The Impetus,2014,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,289,0,0.0,0,"A new cuvée, at least for me, is the 2014 Impetus Proprietary Red, a blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, that is a multi-appellation wine coming from Sonoma as well as Napa. There is hardly anything to complain about here, as this wine was sourced primarily from the De Crescenzo Vineyard in Sonoma and the Tench Vineyard in Napa. Dense purple with notes of creosote, blackberry and graphite, this opaque, purple wine offers dense, chewy blackcurrant and blackberry fruit with new saddle leather and forest floor. Moderate tannins kick in to finish, as it is relatively structured and masculine for a 2014, and therefore probably would benefit from 2-3 years of bottle age. Drink it over the following 20-25 years. "
3412,Paul Hobbs Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2019,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,529,14.9,0.0,0,"Blackcurrants, black cherries, ripe raspberries and tar. Some graphite, too. It’s full-bodied and very plush with crushed tannins and an airy mouth-feel. Just floats across the palate. So fine. It has a second finish at the end, where the tannins emerge at the front of the palate. Quite unique. Drinkable now, but Best after 2027. More expressive and open-knit, the 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard sports a similar ruby/purple to go with an incredible array of black raspberry, cassis, flowery incense, orange blossom, smoked tobacco, and exotic spice. As are all To Kolans, it's incredibly perfumed and complex aromatically, and it's one of those wines that changes every time you come back to the glass. Full-bodied on the palate, it offers beautiful richness and depth, a light, graceful mouthfeel, silky tannins, and a heavenly finish. It's another magical wine from this talented winemaker that readers will absolutely love. A glowing representation of Beckstoffer To Kalon Cabernet with a classic nose of blackcurrant, graphite and new cedar oak. Full-bodied and richly layered with immensely concentrated black fruit flavours that are pure silk on the palate. Satiny, ultra-fine tannins make this almost too easy to drink, while decadent melted chocolate notes merge with baking spices to complete this scrumptious wine. As it opens, the wine begins to reveal a mineral elegance that is iron-like, along with pretty red florals and finishing with crème de cassis and herbs. A real collector wine. Shows menthol, sweet bay leaf, violet and tobacco notes, which set the stage for a core of winey cassis and crushed plum fruit. Ample structure courses underneath, with a tilt to loamy in feel through the deep, broad finish. Reveals a late flash of iron, too. A serious version. Best from 2023. "

Champagne is a blend of heirloom varietals of Pinot Blanc, Arbanne, and Petit Meslier from the 2011 base vintage and perpetual reserve and was aged for nine years on the lees. It offers beautiful creaminess both aromatically and on the palate, with layered refinement, revealing notes of quince, orchard fruit, and dewy fresh grass. The palate has energy without feeling austere, the mousse is fine and pillowy, and the wine lifted and refreshing. It is such a fun, geeky wine with a lot of pleasure. It is zippy on the back end and makes you come back for more. Drink over the next 20 years. Fun aromas of dried green mangos and green apples with ginger. Full-bodied with zippy acidity and a long, intense finish. Lots of dried fruit. Spiced pear, too. Really attractive and delicious. Pinot blanc, arbanne and petit meslier. From 2011 vintage.

It's medium to full-bodied, decently concentrated and nicely balanced, marrying silky tannins to a bright, vibrant finish. Best After 2022 "
3418,Chateau Figeac (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,599,14.1,0.0,0,"This is a really beautiful red with crushed-berry, plum, bark, mushroom and earth character. It’s full and creamy-textured with lots of tannins, but they are integrated and polished and flow across the palate. So much depth and intensity, yet there’s underlying grace and class. Try after 2025. The 2019 Château Figeac checks in as 36% Cabernet Franc, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 30% Merlot, and it's another brilliant wine from Frédéric Faye. This deep purple-hued effort offers a beautiful Pauillac-like bouquet of ripe black cherries, cassis, damp earth, leafy herbs, chocolate, and smoked tobacco. It has classic Figeac herbal, earthy goodness (no doubt due to its high percentage of Cabernet) and is medium to full-bodied on the palate, has perfect tannins and flawless balance, all making for a brilliant Saint-Emilion that brings richness and power paired with finesse and elegance. Give bottles 4-5 years, count yourself lucky, and enjoy over the following 30+. Best after 2026. The 2019 Figeac has turned out brilliantly. Wafting from the glass with aromas of blackberries, cassis, warm spices, violets and pencil shavings, framed by a deft touch of nicely integrated new oak, it's full-bodied, deep and concentrated, with terrific depth at the core, powdery structuring tannins and lively acids, concluding with a long, precise finish. Rich but vibrant, this 2019 reflects the new precision that Frédéric Faye has brought to Figeac; but while it's richer and more polished than the wines of yesteryear, the estate's identity hasn't been lost. Best after 2029. Large-scaled, capturing all the rich and flamboyant cassis, steeped plum and blackberry reduction notes that are hallmarks of the vintage, along with a broad swath of loam and warm gravel underneath as tobacco and alder accents fill in wherever possible. Muscular and toothy along the edges but rock-solid in build, with enough fruit to round into form eventually. Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Best from 2024. "

It underwent malolactic fermentation in old 500-liter French oak, and then spent nine months in foudres ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 liters. It has a very seductive bouquet of plush red currant and cranberry fruit with touches of vanilla and almond. The palate is well balanced with fine, quite edgy tannin. This is linear and conservative in some ways, but it has a very penetrating finish that leaves a tingle of white pepper on the finish. Give this a year in bottle, then drink to your heart’s content. Drinking Window: 2020 - 2032. Bright, with a floral note pulling high-pitched cherry, blood orange and damson plum fruit flavors along. Light shiso leaf and mineral hints streak the finish. "
3421,Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,989",13.4,0.0,0,"One of the greatest wines produced in Bordeaux this year is the 2019 Lafite Rothschild, an impeccably balanced classic of immense charm and grace. Wafting from the glass with arresting aromas of cassis, blackberries and cherries mingled with violets, cigar box and warm spices, it's medium to full-bodied, deep and seamless, its velvety attack segueing into a layered, concentrated mid-palate framed by exquisitely powdery tannins and ripe acids, and concluding with a long, perfumed finish. This rivals the 2010 and 2016 as the greatest Lafite of the decade, and of those three vintages, it's clearly the most sensual and demonstrative out of the gates. The blend contains fully 94% Cabernet Sauvignon and attained a modest 13.4% alcohol. Best After 2029 The Grand Vin 2019 Château Lafite Rothschild is based on 94% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Merlot, and 1% Petit Verdot that hit 13.4% natural alcohol with a pH of 3.9. It's a pure, seamless, incredibly accessible Lafite offering a beautiful, classic array of ripe currants, spice box, tobacco, and classic Lafite sandalwood and lead pencil nuances. Medium to full-bodied and beautifully balanced on the palate, it has a seamless, layered mouthfeel, just about perfect tannins, and a finish that just keeps you coming back to the glass. Despite the high pH, it remains fresh, lively, and a perfect example of the class this estate is known for. It's up-front and accessible (and I'd gladly drink a bottle), but smart money will hide bottles for just 5-7 years and enjoy them over the coming 30-40 years. A very energetic wine, with wild loganberry, mulberry and black currant fruit flavors that bristle with mouthwatering bay leaf, licorice root and savory notes. The finish is tight now, with charcoal shadings and a smoldering cast iron note, but it has additional black tea, incense and floral hints for contrast. Dense and driven, with more than enough elements to match its energy, meaning this can cruise in the cellar for a long time. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Best from 2026. "
3422,Chateau Canon (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,339,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2019 Château Canon is another brilliant wine from this talented team that delivers everything you could want from this incredible terroir located on the upper limestone plateau. Based on 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc, it has a pure, incredibly refined, yet still powerful profile that takes time to unwind. Offering up beautiful notes of black raspberries, wild strawberries, spring flowers, chalky minerality, and graphite, it hits the palate with medium to full-bodied richness, a layered, multi-dimensional mouthfeel, ultra-fine tannins, and a finish that's something to behold. This isn't the massive style of the 2015 and reminds me slightly of the 2016. It's perfectly balanced and, again, the purity and finesse are off the charts. It needs to be forgotten for 4-5 years and enjoyed over the following 2-3 decades. Hats off to Nicolas Audebert for another sensational wine. Best after 2026. Blackberries, blueberries and dark chocolate with bark, mushrooms and chalk. Lavender, too. Full-bodied with firm tannins that are polished and velvety. White pepper, gesso and crushed stone. It’s full-bodied and layered with tightness and focus and a long finish. It’s solid and stalwart, as usual. Reminds me of the very special 1955. One for the cellar. Give this until 2026 to see what it really has. Violet, cassis, plum purée and blackberry reduction notes are layered together without being compacted, giving each space to breath and unfurl while letting the fine lacy thread of chalky minerality to flow in between. This shows the heat and slight grain of this distinctive vintage, but manages those aspects better than most. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best After 2025. "
3423,Chateau Petrus (1.5 Liter Magnum),2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"12,999",14.5,0.0,0,"The 2018 Petrus has retained its opaque purple-black color after bottling, foreshadowing the seemingly frozen-in-time glacial pace at which this wine is proceeding. It opens very reluctantly, requiring considerable air with vigorous swirling and doggedly demands a few hours before it offers glimpses at this slumbering giant of a wine. As it eventually unfurls, it slowly morphs into a powerful, fantastically pure nose of preserved plums, blackberry preserves and blueberry compote, followed by nuances of molten licorice, dark chocolate, black truffles, iron ore and, still later, floral notions of lilacs and rose oil come through. The full-bodied palate is taut, muscular and oh-so-tightly wound at this stage, revealing peeks at many, many layers of perfectly ripe black and blue fruits, exotic spices and earthy notions for which words simply fail. Clear flesh to the plump damson fruits, alongside grilled caramel, graphite, cassis bud and cocoa bean. The tannins are plentiful, but they are plush, ripe and flexible, and as such are full of Pomerol signature. As it opens through the palate, you realise just how much grip and persistency there is, and the more serious side asserts itself, with bitter cocoa shavings and fresh acidities. A more approachable Petrus at this early stage than in many years, but the kick is there and this is getting set for the long term. 50% new oak. Bottled in July after two months in vat following end of barrel ageing. Drinking Window 2026 - 2048 Plush and inviting, with steeped red and black currant and fig flavors that meld nicely with fruitcake, Christmas pudding and anise notes through the finish. Subtle dark earth hint at the end keeps it grounded. The vintage's slightly austere edge is here, but is minimized by the fruit, helping this stand apart from the pack. Best from 2023 through 2034. "
3424,Eric Kent Sonoma Sauvignon Blanc,2020,Sauvignon Blanc,California,26,0,0.0,0,"Boasts grapefruit, yellow apple and apple blossom notes that are both vibrant and elegant, with a touch of candied ginger and tangerine on the finish. Drink now. "
3425,Chateau Palmer (1.5 Liter Magnum),2016,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,789,13.5,0.0,0,"The finest vintage I’ve ever tasted from this estate, surpassing the 2009 and 2010, the 2016 Château Palmer is a blend of 47% each of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Petit Verdot, all of which was brought up in 65% new French oak. This magical effort reveals a saturated purple color as well as a huge nose of crème de cassis, graphite, crushed rocks, and spring flowers, and it develops beautifully with time in the glass. Full-bodied, deep, incredibly concentrated and powerful, it nevertheless just glides over the palate with flawless purity and balance, present, ripe tannins, and a finish that just won’t quit. This is Bordeaux at its most regal and classic. It will be drinkable with just 4-5 years of bottle age and keep for half a century. Such attractive fruit and alluring ripeness that it draws you in from the get-go. The discreet power here is delivered with a very astute touch. Assorted dark-berry aromas, as well as red plums, abound on the nose. The richness and depth in the mouth is stunning. The tannins are super polished and layered and they draw pristine dark fruit flavors deep into the finish in effortless mode. This is a star of the vintage. A blend of 47 per cent merlot, 47 per cent cabernet sauvignon and six per cent petit verdot. Try from 2024. As is always the case with Palmer, the richness, depth and silkiness is just so impressive. Sophisticated and well constructed, with a vertical lift-off, there's a creamy richness on the palate which supports pencil-lead, liquorice, damson, black cherry and slate. I love the smoky cocoa bean finish. Like the Alter Ego, it's a different style this year but no less impressive, displaying width, heft and incredible persistency. It's a wine that's going to age far into the future and is extremely easy to recommend. The highest ever proportion of grand vin was produced in 2016. This is a very solid rendering, with a core of steeped blackberry, black currant and fig fruit flavors that are juicy and well-defined. The back end picks up lots of graphite, tobacco, anise and violet notes while maintaining focus and energy. Shows latent depth as the fruit echoes steadily. Best from 2023 through 2038. "
3426,Umani Ronchi Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Podere,2019,Montepulciano,Italy,12,13,3.9,45,
3427,Chateau Mayne Vieil,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,16,14.5,0.0,0,This dense wine offers rich blackberry flavors. Dark tannins contrast with ripe fruits to give a wine that has solid layers along with a juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2023. 
3428,Domaine Della Russian River Pinot Noir,2016,Pinot Noir,California,64,14.5,0.0,0,"Pale to medium ruby-purple, the 2016 Pinot Noir Russian River Valley is scented of tobacco leaf, smoke, dried leaves and dusty earth over savory black fruits with blue fruit nuances. Medium-bodied, it packs in the savory dark fruits in the mouth, framed by firm, grainy tannins and finishing long with earthy layers. Leading off the reds, the 2016 Pinot Noir Russian River Valley is the appellation blend of the estate and spent 15 months in 47% new French oak. Its vivid ruby color is followed by a great nose of black raspberries, mulled cherries, forest floor, and earth. It's medium to full-bodied, has a rounded, mouthfilling texture, terrific fruit, and a great finish. Drink it over the coming 7-8 years. "
3429,Donelan Richards Family Vineyard Syrah,2013,Syrah/Shiraz,California,189,14.8,0.0,0,"Produced using 80% whole cluster and aged for 28 months in French oak, 33% new, the 2013 Syrah Richard's Vineyard has a deep garnet-purple color and a wonderfully meaty/earthy nose of prosciutto, underbrush and tapenade with a core of crushed black currants, black cherries and tar, plus hints of Provence herbs and garrigue. Full-bodied, rich and concentrated, this wine manages to have beautiful finesse with a gorgeous multi-layered palate and fine frame of rounded tannins intermingled with the chewier stem tannins to give great support, finishing long and spicy. 466 cases were made. "
3430,Chateau Leoville Las Cases (3 Liter),1989,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,499",0,0.0,0,"1989 was an early year, with flowering three weeks ahead of usual. Now at 30 years old, a floral aspect curls out of the glass, with touches of roses and peonies, followed on the palate by bilberries and blackberries, with a cigar smoke and eucalyptus finish. It's still vigorous in its tannic structure, but it's soft and supple enough to enjoy today. This bottle was recorked by hand at the winery last year, with five people checking every single one of the 5,000 bottles remaining at the chateau. The wines were topped up from magnums of the 1989. 3% Petit Verdot completes the blend - a variety not used in the grand vin since 1996. Very ripe, with raisin and dried fruits on the nose. You can smell the sun-dried grapes. Full-bodied, delivering firm tannins and a very fresh palate. Long and flavorful, offering currant, berries and all sorts of dark fruits, but turns lightly earthy and floral. This is a thoroughly complex wine. Just starting to really open into the mature 20-year-old wine it is, but such a great life ahead of it. Opaque deep ruby/purple, this rich wine offers a reserved yet promising bouquet of black and red fruits nicely interspersed with scents of vanillin. Very rich, opulent, long, and mouthfilling, Las Cases is packed with fruit, is medium to full-bodied, and impeccably well-balanced. Although showy and flattering after bottling, the wine has closed down and is now difficult to penetrate and assess. Given its low acidity, it should open and blossom in several years. "
3431,Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Richebourg Grand Cru,1988,Pinot Noir,France,"4,499",0,0.0,0,"The Richebourg was an explosive wine with an earthy, cinnamon, gingery, soy sauce aroma backed up with the intense smell of plums and toasty new oak. Extremely rich, full bodied, and awesomely proportioned, this heroic wine should be drunk from the late nineties through the first two decades of the twenty-first century. It seems bigger, fuller, and more powerful than even the celestial 1985. Tight and beautifully focused, with a laser beam of plum, raspberry and tart cherry flavor, hinting at cola and spice around the edges, nailed in place by lavish tannins and sharp acidity. It's an age-worthy package, already showing a glimmer of silky texture. Mature aromas of jam, spice and violets lead to amazingly powerful yet velvety medium-bodied flavors that are supported by firm but softening tannins which the extract buffers on the delicious, long and mouth-coating if ever-so-slightly warm finish. This mildly rustic effort has reached full maturity. "
3432,Rhys Vineyards Bearwallow Vineyard Chardonnay,2014,Chardonnay,California,89,13.2,0.0,0,"Harvey's 2014 Chardonnay Bearwallow Vineyard is classy, orchard fruit, white peach and honeysuckle-scented effort that has notable richness, a balanced, layered texture and a touch of minerality and toastiness on the finish. It's ideal for drinking over the coming 4-6 years. "
3433,Chateau de Rouanne Vinsobres Rouge,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,48,15.52,0.0,0,"Delivers a nice saturated feel without being heavy, letting cherry and plum paste notes unfurl slowly, along with violet, licorice root and warm humus accents, which all blossom steadily through the savory finish. Looking at the reds, the 2019 Vinsobres is unquestionably outstanding and has lots of Syrah character in its dark, meaty fruits, peppery herb, violet, and chalky mineral-like aromas and flavors. Medium-bodied, nicely textured, and balanced, it has plenty of structure and will keep for 8-10 years. Best after 2022. "
3434,Chateau Unang Ventoux La Source,2017,Rhone Red Blends,France,31,13,0.0,0,"The Syrah-dominated 2017 Ventoux La Source (there’s 25% Grenache and 5% Cinsault) reveals a more saturated purple hue as well as ripe notes of earthy blackberries, licorice, violets, and peppered game. Medium-bodied, vibrant, and lively on the palate, you’d be excused if you guessed Northern Rhône Syrah in a blind tasting. Nicely textured, light on its feet, and beautifully balanced, it’s another terrific wine from this estate. It’s going to evolve for 7-8 years, if not longer. "
3435,Domaine Remi Jobard Monthelie Vignes Rondes Premier Cru,2019,Pinot Noir,France,79,0,0.0,0,"A spicier and slightly more elegant nose is also more floral suffused on the red cherry and plum scents. The rich and equally seductively textured medium-bodied flavors possess a bit more restraint while displaying a touch of youthful austerity on the firmer and grippier finish. While qualitatively similar to the Santenots, these two wines are quite different. "

3437,Couvent des Jacobins,2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,49,14.5,0.0,0,"This is really succulent and juicy with brambleberry, wet-earth, bark and mushroom aromas and flavors. Crushed stones as well, with a slight saltiness. It’s full-to medium-bodied with creamy tannins and light chewiness at the finish. Needs time to soften, but very pretty already and typical for the vintage. A blend of 85% merlot, 10% cabernet franc and 5% petit verdot. Try after 2025. The top 2019 Couvent Des Jacobins is deep ruby/purple-hued and gives up a solid perfume of spiced black cherries, mulberries, dried herbs, tobacco, and iron. It's medium-bodied on the palate, has solid tannins, good overall balance, and outstanding length. It's a solid, thoroughly enjoyable 2019 to drink over the coming 10-15 years. Best After 2022 "

3439,Domaine Ponsot Morey-Saint-Denis Clos des Monts Luisants Premier Cru Blanc,2018,Aligote,France,219,0,0.0,0,"With renewed interest in the grape thanks to the group of producers known as Les Aligoteurs, this famous, mostly old-vine parcel of Aligoté is enjoying more of the limelight than ever. Cool, breezy and very mineral, with chiselled acidity, notes of lemon zest and green herbs, subtle oaking and a long, sappy, mouthwatering finish. The 2018 Morey-Saint-Denis 1er Cru Clos des Monts Luisants Blanc has turned out very nicely in bottle, mingling scents of pear and white flowers with hints of beeswax, toasted almonds and petrol. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and chiseled, it's nicely concentrated, with tangy acids and a layered core of fruit. A serious and complex white, revealing lemon cake, white peach, beeswax and pastry aromas and flavors. Creamy in texture and harmonious, with a lingering aftertaste of lemon, saline mineral and roasted almond. Drink now (Tasted separately from the 150th anniversary). Fine pale colour, with a slightly nutty nose, full-bodied with a little bit of greengage before a softer flesh takes over. Certainly, this is very long though, and only modestly hot given the nature of the summer season. 13.5% alcohol. "
3440,Cossart Gordon 10 Year Malmsey Maderia (500 ML,bottle),Madeira,Portugal,29,19,0.0,0,"This soothing, ripe balm is richly textured with toffee and old wood flavors. It has great richness, balancing the acidity and orange marmalade fruitiness with the maturity of wood aging. Drink now The new release of Cossart Gordon's NV Malmsey 10 Year Old is showing well, offering up aromas of sultanas, figs, mocha and ripe peaches. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and textural, it's nicely proportioned, with a fleshy core of fruit but lively balancing acids. This is a fine example of the category, even if this shipper's five-year-old Malmsey nips at its heels. "
3441,La Voix Reflektor John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir,2015,Pinot Noir,California,64,14,0.0,0,"Tangy strawberry aromas are lifted by white pepper on this bottling by Steve Clifton from a vineyard that sits toward the eastern edge of the appellation. There is a snappy freshness to the palate, where tart red fruits mix with dewy thyme and, on the finish, a lavender lift. "
3442,Chateau Latour (1 Bottle in OWC),2005,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,"1,199",0,0.0,0,"A very complex nose of lavender, currants, spices, and hot stones. Full and dense on the palate, with a very tight structure. The tannins have a perfect polish to their density, and the finish is very intense, with wonderful fruit and truffle character. This turns almost decadent, with tremendous energy and a constantly changing profile. This is a very challenging wine to get to know, please leave this for at least ten years. Pull the cork in 2015. A great wine, the summation of a great vintage in Bordeaux. The core of richness, the dense, bone-dry tannins, the black currants, red berries and black plum skins are the elements, but it's the way they have been integrated that makes this such an impressive wine. There is great elegance as well, a fabulous counterpoint to such power. Cellar for at least 15 years, but this will keep forever. How rare to confront a wine of this inner strength and perfect form. Grown at a 116-acre vineyard at the southern border of Pauillac, some of the vines now reaching 100 years of age on a gravel bar overlooking the Gironde, Latour harvests cabernet sauvignon with natural power. I could describe it as colors, from glistening ruby to purple-black then back to scarlet tannins that vibrate in red. Or just the pure, unadulterated flavor of black currant, unformed as a child is unformed, beautiful as a child is beautiful. However I might describe it, the wine is stronger than I am and will outlast me by decades. This is the most provocative and most brilliant Latour I have tasted on release. Dark ruby black in color. Brilliant, intense aromas of mineral, blackberry and currant, with hints of Indian spices and cigar box, lead to a full-bodied palate, with ultrafine tannins and a beautiful balance of blackberry, raspberry and mineral. There's subtlety, yet also great depth. Lasts for minutes on the palate. This is a Latour with fabulous tone and vigor. A massive, powerful wine that tastes like the essence of the great estate, the 2005 Château Latour is based on 87% Cabernet Sauvignon and the balance Merlot and Petit Verdot brought up in new barrels. It reveals a saturated purple/plum color as well as a gorgeous bouquet of blackcurrants, graphite, gravelly earth, tobacco, lead pencil, and chocolate. Dense, full-bodied, and massively concentrated, it has the more austere, masculine style of the estate front and center, yet has gorgeously sweet tannin, a stacked mid-palate, and a great, great finish. This profound, regal 2005 can be drunk any time over the coming 40-50 years, and I suspect even longer. "

Bright and tangy, the palate offers apricot, yellow apple and orange zest alongside crisp acidity and a lively, refined mousse. COMMENTARY: The Tenuta Il Bosco Oltrenero Brut is elegant, refined, and beautifully balanced. TASTING NOTES: This wine exhibits lively beads that lead into palate flavors of light minerality and a suggestion of ripe fruit and nuttiness. Pair it with grilled white fish.

This powerful and bone-dry riesling has great, peachy fruit and a long, focused finish that's intensely mineral. The 2019 Maximin Grünhaus Riesling Trocken Alte Reben opens with an intense and concentrated bouquet of crushed stones and ripe fruit but is very reductive at this very early stage. Full-bodied, very elegant and floral on the palate, this is quite an intense but pure and fresh Ruwer classic with Pfalz genes, charmingly ripe fruit, good grip and good tension on the finish. It should improve with bottle age. "

3454,Domaine Della Graham Family Vineyard Pinot Noir,2017,Pinot Noir,California,79,14.5,0.0,0,"Pale ruby, the 2017 Pinot Noir Graham Family Vineyard offers concentrated aromas of cranberry sauce, crushed cherries, gravel dust, cola and underbrush with touches of Angostura bitters, orange peel and tar. It’s medium-bodied and silky, offering intense, earth-laced fruits, a gently grainy frame and a long, juicy finish. Full bodied and robustly velvety in style, this offers a richness of vanilla and baking spice around core elements of rhubarb, strawberry and orange peel. The flavors come together around supple integrated tannin and oak, with a deft thread of acidity throughout. The 2017 Pinot Noir Graham Family Vineyard is similar to the 2016 with its ripe cherry, strawberry, and floral core, yet it's slightly fresher and more lively, with a beautifully layered, elegant texture. With good acidity, ripe tannins, it's already drinking beautifully yet should easily keep for 7-8 years. This cuvée was brought up for 15 months in 52% new French oak. "

The palate has immense elan and flow, with juiciness that references ripe Mirabelle and even a touch of honey. This liveliness, however, is anchored in lovely texture that reaches as deep as it does high. A ripe yet agreeably fresh nose reflects notes of apricot, peach and lemon rind. There is slightly better vibrancy to the delicious and relatively refined and appealingly textured medium weight flavors that exude a bracing salinity on the slightly longer and more complex finale.

The delicious middle weight flavors possess a caressing and attractively textured mouthfeel before culminating a lingering and refined finale that offers fine depth. This is a Santenots of refinement and while soft is too strong, it certainly is more approachable than is typical. "
3465,Vignoble Dampt Freres Chablis Les Fourneaux Premier Cru,2019,Chardonnay,France,49,0,0.0,0,"The 2019 Chablis Les Fourneaux 1er Cru sports an attractive nose with red apples, citrus peel and flinty aromas all vying for attention. The fresh, focused palate is quite concentrated and admirably weighty, the acidity counterbalancing the richness of this Fourneaux. Grippy on the finish, suggesting it will benefit from a couple of years in bottle, but there is good potential. Worth keeping an eye on. "

It springs from the glass with vibrant red and black cherries, raspberry coulis and pomegranate scents with suggestions of lilacs, crushed rocks and damp soil, giving way to a raw, savory, almost animal underbelly. The full-bodied, generously fruited palate is beautifully juxtaposed by impressive freshness and a firm, grainy texture, finishing with an amazing array of fragrant earth and black truffle-inspired layers. All the hints are there that this could warrant a higher score after a few years in bottle, but as usual, I've been conservative and called it as it is today. Score aside, this is a very exciting, unmistakably singular wine. Coming from the more sandy soils of the estate The Third Twin Vineyard and just bottled, the 2017 The Other Lady TBD checks in as 42% Grenache, 17% Mourvèdre, 15% Petite Sirah, 12% Graciano, 11.5% Syrah, and the final 2.5% Viognier. It saw just a touch of stems (18%) and spent 32 months in just 12% new French oak. Deep purple/blue, it offers a stunning bouquet of blueberries, black cherries, bay leaf, smoked game, pepper, and violets. Rich, full-bodied, and beautifully concentrated on the palate, with ripe tannins, it shows the more focused, structured style of the vintage beautifully and is going to be long lived. "
3468,Schild Estate Narrow Road Shiraz Cabernet,2018,Other Red Blends,Australia,59,14.5,0.0,0,"Salted caramel and almond brittle notes add a sweet and savory note to the thick, ripe kirsch and raspberry puree flavors that are generous and intense, with plenty of concentration on the finish. Ripe but still-juicy strawberry and plum preserves are in the fore on this big-boned but finessed wine. Spicy cedar wood, violet, chocolate and a gentle earthy, pepper spice trail behind. The palace is round in shape with silky, pleasantly plump berry fruit and well-placed spiced tannins. More characterful that many of this brands others reds, this is still young so a decanter and protein is vital if drinking now, otherwise cellar until around 2024, then drink until another eight to ten years beyond that.

3469,Merryvale Pinot Noir,2016,Pinot Noir,California,45,14.5,0.0,0,"This has a very smoothly delivered array of rich dark cherries and plums, swathed in dark, toasted spices and a rich, supple and round finish.  "
3470,Pina Napa Valley D'Adamo Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,2016,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,119,0,0.0,0,"The 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon d'Adamo Vineyard comes from a site in the foothills of Atlas Peak and is described as her most hedonistic wine by Monticelli. I can’t disagree, yet it also offers plenty of intellectual fireworks as well and reveals a deep purple color and sexy notes of black fruits, licorice, new saddle leather, and assorted herbs, earthy notes. With a plush, rounded, sumptuous texture, sweet tannins, and terrific overall balance, it’s another remarkable wine from this estate that can be drunk today with ample pleasure or cellared for two decades or more. Burnt blackberries, dried mulberries, cassis and eucalyptus oil. Full body, round tannins, plenty of fruit and a chewy finish. Drink in 2023. "

I believe there’s a touch of Grenache in the blend, as well as some Clairette and other varieties, but the bulk of this cuvée comes from the famed la Crau lieu-dit and is brought up all in demi-muids. It offers a beautiful perfume of sweet kirsch and blueberry fruit intermixed with loads of licorice, sweet spice, violets, and crushed rocks. Full-bodied, super intense, sweetly fruited, perfumed, and complex, it’s a gorgeous 2015 that does everything right. Forget bottles for 4-6 years and it should keep for 2 to 3 decades. "
3472,Rhys Vineyards Home Vineyard Pinot Noir,2011,Pinot Noir,California,109,13.2,0.0,0,"This is much more elegant with admirable purity to the refined combination of both red and blue pinot fruit, spice and violet-inflected scents. There is equally good refinement to the beautifully well-delineated and vibrant medium-bodied flavors that also exhibit a robust and muscular finish that is impeccably well-balanced. This is quite firm and will definitely require a few years of cellar time. "

3476,Pride Mountain Vineyards Reserve Claret,2013,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,229,14.8,0.0,0,"Close to perfection is the 2013 Reserve Claret, a blend of 62% Merlot, 37% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Petit Verdot, aged 22 months in 20% new French oak. There are 450 cases of this big boy (14.8% alcohol). This is a 30-year wine and a spectacular effort, with 14% coming from the Napa side of the property and 86% from the Sonoma County side. Dense opaque purple, with a glorious nose of chocolate, and espresso intermixed with mulberry fruit, blueberry and blackberry, it is fleshy, succulent, full-bodied, opulent and impressively structured. In fact, the 2013 tannic profile is alive in this wine, and thus I suggest 3-5 years of bottle age. Drink it over the following three decades. "
3477,Domaine Geoffroy Chablis Beauroy Vieilles Vignes Premier Cru,2019,Chardonnay,France,53,13,0.0,0,"A subtle kiss of underripe pineapple introduces this plump, immediately enjoyable Chablis.

Full body with racy tannins and a long, long. Slippery texture, like candle wax. Released fall 2014. An exciting, vibrant Syrah, intense and deeply flavored, offering rich dark berry, spice, roasted herb and hot stone sensations that are sharply focused but also quite tannic and chewy. Best from 2016 through 2028. "
3480,Sine Qua Non Against the Wall,1996,Syrah/Shiraz,California,817,0,0.0,0,"Sine Qua Non has produced some spectacular Syrahs, buying fruit from the best sources in Santa Barbara - the Alban, Stolpman, and Bien Nacido vineyards. The 1996 Against The Wall Syrah is cut from the same mold as the 1997. The color is opaque black/purple, and the nose offers a combination of cassis/blackberry jamminess intermixed with tar, pepper, and spice. Thick, massively full, yet wonderfully rich and expansive, with admirable purity and mouth-staining levels of glycerin and extract, this full-bodied, silky-smooth Syrah is deceptively easy to drink.

3482,Clos Apalta (1.5 Liter Magnum),2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,Chile,279,15,0.0,0,"So aromatic and fresh with dried flowers, sweet tobacco and hints of straw. Red fruit, cloves and green peppercorns. Medium-to full-bodied with fine tannins that are very fresh and refined. Fine, silky and beautiful. Hints of minerals and granite to the dark fruit. Such gorgeous length and beauty. 64% carmenere, 18% cabernet franc and 18% merlot. Extremely long and poised. Cooler wine. From biodynamically grown grapes. Delicious to drink already, but another three to four years will make it even better. There is a lot of Carmenere character on the nose of the 2018 Clos Apalta, which was produced with 64% Carmenere, 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and 18% Merlot, a blend that is similar to the one used in 2016. The wine is not shy at all and hits the scale at 15% alcohol. It's showy, heady, hedonistic, aromatic, full-bodied and lush with abundant velvety tannins and a long and powerful finish where the notes of black peppercorns and tea and tobacco leaves dominate. This might not be a wine for everybody, but fans of the style will love it. "

Inviting nose offers cassis, leather, black pepper and cocoa powder. Very suave and fine-grained, with harmonious acidity carrying the dark fruit and cocoa flavors through a very long, resounding finish. Polished tannins coat the front teeth. This is amazingly fresh for a wine that was only bottled in December of 2010. Rich, opulent and full-bodied with good purity as well as a boatload of character, this superb 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon Keys is approachable, but should evolve for another 15-20 years. This wine’s dense purple color is followed by abundant aromas of creme de cassis, licorice, subtle smoke, and a truffle-infused earthiness. "
3485,Chateau Montrose (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,399,14.5,0.0,0,"Blueberries, cracked white and black pepper with dried flowers. Some crushed stone and slate, too. Full-bodied with tannins that grow on the palate and continue on. It’s polished and very fine with lovely length. Best from 2027. The 2019 Montrose has turned out very well in bottle, wafting from the glass with a dramatic, perfumed bouquet of wild berries and cassis mingled with notions of lilac, violets, pencil shavings and warm spices, framed by nicely integrated new oak. Full-bodied, layered and seamless, it's deep and multidimensional, with lively acids, beautifully refined tannins and a long, resonant finish. Checking in at 14.4% alcohol (rather higher than, for example, the brilliant 2009's 13.7% or the 2016's 13.3%), this is an undeniably powerful, ripe Montrose, but for now everything appears to be kept in check. Best After 2029 The flagship 2019 Château Montrose is also brilliant, although it's not going to match the all-time greats from this estate. Gorgeous cassis, graphite, damp earth, cedar pencil, and tobacco are just some of the nuances here, and it's medium to full-bodied, with a pure, graceful, layered mouthfeel, building tannins, and a great finish. It doesn't have the overall density or mid-palate of the 2018 or 2016, but it’s flawlessly balanced and just incredibly impressive. Showing more and more tannins with time in the glass, it will need a decade of bottle age and will evolve for 30+ years. Best After 2032 Lush and lovely, showing a mix of creamed loganberry, plum, boysenberry and mulberry flavors that borders on exotic, but everything stays harnessed by sleek floral and iron notes through the finish. This has ample structure for balance that's well-embedded in the fruit, making this seemingly approachable now but there's absolutely no rush. A beauty. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2023.  "

Deep ruby to the rim with that classic Rayas nose of flowers, kirsch liqueur, black raspberries, crushed rocks, and minerals, the wine is dense and concentrated, with a broad, savory mouthfeel, sweet yet silky tannin, fabulous persistence, and a blockbuster finish that just goes on and on. This is a reassuringly profound Rayas that seems to suggest that Emmanuel Reynaud has finally figured out this cold-climate terroir in a warm climate appellation. Lovely perfume, with tightly woven red and black cherry, graphite, incense, mineral and sous bois notes that stay fresh and focused thanks to finely imbedded acidity. Stylish finish. "

Medium to full-bodied on the palate, it has ripe tannins, terrific overall balance, and a great finish. This estate is incredibly consistent, and their 2019 is another gem of a wine. Intense, piquant, black cherry nose. A very dark, fairly full-bodied style, but with a good sense of freshness. Fairly tannic - a little overextracted perhaps. Tannins are a little stemmy and fibrous, they spread like roots through the wine. Give it time. "
3496,Paul Pernot Bienvenue-Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,449,0,0.0,0,"Lovely clear pale colour with the lightest lime inflection. The nose is much classier than the Pucelles. This has all that it should, with a little soft oaking, some gentle pear fruit, the barrel now adding a little toast on top. Low but adequate acidity, does not show through the volume of fruit. Very engaging. "

There’s such attractively intense chocolate and dark-cherry flavors on the palate. Super fine tannins. Some baking spices, too. Very integrated and balanced with sustained freshness and a long finish. Second wine of Chateau L’Evangile.  The 2017 Chateau L'Evangile Blason De L'Evangile is a blend of 50% Merlot and 50% Cabernet Franc, aged in 14 months in used barrels. Its deep ruby color is followed by a ripe, complex red that has lots of Cabernet Franc assorted red and black fruits, leafy herbs, lead pencil, tobacco, and cedar aromas and flavors. With an almost Left Bank style, it's medium-bodied, has silky tannins, beautiful elegance, and a great finish. The Blason is a 50/50 blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, taking a month, from 4 September to 3 October, to pick due to 50% of the vines being affected by frost, which cut yields and delayed ripening - the optical sorter came in useful to identify the best bunches. This has good freshness and a sense of energy, with bright cherry fruits. The yield for the frosted vines was down to 4hl/ha, and on the non-frosted vines it was 40hl/ha, giving a final yield of 21hl/ha. Composed of 50% Merlot and 50% Cabernet Franc, the medium to deep garnet-purple colored 2017 Blason de l'Evangile features expressive notes of crushed black cherries, mulberries and plum preserves with touches of kirsch, dark chocolate, lavender and cloves. Medium to full-bodied, the palate delivers great density and loads of floral sparks among the dark fruits, framed by fine-grained tannins and bold freshness, finishing long and fragrant. "
3498,Bastianich Vespa Rosso,2015,Other Red Blends,Italy,43,13.5,0.0,0,"A lovely blend of Merlot and Refosco, the Bastianich 2015 Vespa Rosso is a beautifully layered and generous wine that starts off with ripe cherry and blackberry and segues to spice, campfire ash and baker's chocolate. There are subtle touches of both the sweet and the savory, and the wine is grounded and balanced at its core. This is a mid-weight red with soft tannins and a solid sense of balance. This is a terrific pairing with a rare cut of filet mignon with roasted baby potatoes. Savory green olive, balsamico and smoke notes meet steeped black cherry and citrus peel flavors in this balanced, medium- to full-bodied red, which is firmed by fine-grained tannins. Fresh finish.

That oak is only a structural element, with no overt impact on the cool, oceanic freshness of the wine, nor its bright yellow-apple and green-pear-skin flavor.

There is fine verve and a more elegant mouth feel to the delicious and relatively round medium weight flavors that possess fine depth and really lovely balance on the lingering finish.

Then it reveals scents of lavender along with snappy red-cherry flavors and brambly raspberry notes. The wine continues to evolve over several hours in the glass, picking up subtle spice notes before coming full circle to a smoky, savory finish. A little lean but some pleasing berry and tile character. Medium body, lovely fruit and a juicy finish. Delicious. "

3522,Vidal Wines El Legado Chardonnay,2016,Chardonnay,Zealand,52,13.5,0.0,0,"Refreshingly different in style from the rest of the Chardonnays under the Villa Maria umbrella, Vidal Estate's 2016 Legacy Chardonnay is a medium-bodied, citrus-driven wine. Hints of struck flint appear on the nose, along with subtle pencil shaving suggestions of oak, but the driving force is the wine's concentrated grapefruit flavors that linger through the extended finish. As an aside, the previously reviewed 2011 Legacy Chardonnay (92+) has been rereleased by the winery, and it remains in peak condition, capable of aging through 2020. Note that this wine is labeled El Legado in the United States. Grilled peach fruit aromas on the nose. This has a hedonistic feel in terms of ripe fruit swagger. The palate has impressive acidity and weight and a nicely resolved finish. Drink now. Screw cap. "
3523,Tenuta Sette Cieli Yantra,2020,Bordeaux Red Blends,Italy,26,14.5,0.0,0,"The 2020 Yantra is bright, punchy and full of character.

3526,Chateau Leoville Las Cases (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,549,14.02,0.0,0,"The 2019 Léoville Las Cases is a brilliant young wine that will delight Bordeaux purists. Unwinding in the glass with scents of cassis, dark berries, cigar wrapper and pencil shavings, it’s full-bodied, layered and tightly wound, with a deep core of fruit, lively acids and an abundance of rich, powdery tannins. Concentrated and serious, much like its immediate neighbor Château Latour, it is likely to emerge as one of the vintage’s longest lived—and greatest—wines. Best After 2035 Remarkably sleek and pure, considering the generally burly and obvious tannic profile of the vintage. Delivers a pure and unadulterated beam of cassis and plum reduction flavors inlaid seamlessly with a glistening iron girder that seems to have no endpoint through the finish, where violet, anise and black tea notes shimmer. Reserved overall, with a beautiful austerity, this is an example of how great terroir always shines through—even in extreme years. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best from 2030. More backward, deep, and layered, the Grand Vin 2019 Château Léoville Las Cases is 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot, and the rest Cabernet Franc that saw 90% new French oak. Just awesome aromatics of pure crème de cassis, graphite, tobacco leaf, burning embers, and gravelly earth all soar from the glass. This is followed by a quintessential Léoville Las Cases that's medium to full-bodied, pure, concentrated, and regal on the palate, with beautiful tannins. The purity of fruit is spot on, it's flawlessly balanced, and it’s going to age for decades. While it offers pleasure today, I'd wager it will take 10-15 years to hit maturity and will be a 50+ year wine. Best after 2022. Rating: 97+ "
3527,Thierry Violot-Guillemard Beaune Clos des Mouches Premier Cru,2017,Pinot Noir,France,99,0,0.0,0,"The 2017 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches is showing well, bursting with aromas of raspberries, raw cocoa, woodsmoke and cedary new oak. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, satiny and layered, allying the charm of the vintage with good concentration and mid-palate depth, framed by fine tannins and lively acids. Once again there is a whisper of cigar ash character but in this case it is barely perceptible and does not detract from the cool aromas of various red barriers, lavender and earth hints. The energetic and well-delineated medium-bodied flavors possess a lovely texture that carries over to the dusty, linear and nicely persistent finish. This should benefit from a few years of bottle age in order to better flesh out. "

3530,Chateau Ducru-Beaucaillou (1.5 Liter Magnum),2019,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,449,14.2,0.0,0,"The wine of the vintage in Saint-Julien, if not all of the Médoc, the 2019 Château Ducru-Beaucaillou is based on 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot, aged in 100% new French oak, that hit a natural alcohol of 14.2% with a monster IPT (number of tannins) of 88. It's certainly one of the most concentrated Saint-Juliens, revealing a dense purple hue to go with a stacked bouquet of crème de cassis, freshly sharpened pencils, damp clay, tobacco, and hints of spring flowers. Concentrated, full-bodied, and powerful, it has incredible tannins, flawless balance, and a gorgeous finish. While most estates today are playing it safe and producing more ethereal, elegant wines that drink well right out of the gate, thankfully, this estate continues to make concentrated, powerful, age-worthy wines, and this heavenly beauty is as good as it gets! It will need a decade of bottle age to hit the early stages of maturity and will evolve for 50 years or more. Bravo to Bruno Borie! Best after 2032. This is so seductive on the nose, with perfumes of violets, blackcurrants, raspberries, and orange peel. Subtle. Ethereal. Full-bodied with such fine tannins and delicacy, with great length and beauty. Sophisticated and refined. Really amazing purity and depth. Great length, too. 80% cabernet sauvignon and 20% merlot. Leave this for at least five or six years. "
3531,David Arthur Proprietary Red,2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,California,79,14.9,0.0,0,"The 2017 Proprietary Red Wine is based on 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Merlot, and the rest 2% Petit Verdot and a mix of Italian varieties that was brought up in 45% new French oak. It’s a medium to full-bodied, balanced, elegant wine with pretty notes of red and black currants, tobacco, leafy herbs, and dried flower-like aromas and flavors. It's nicely balanced, has silky tannins, and a great finish. A small portion of this was harvested after the fires, but it doesn't show any signs of smoke taint. "
3532,Chateau Leoville Las Cases (1.5 Liter Magnum),2017,Bordeaux Red Blends,France,409,13,0.0,0,"The purity here is really something. Blackberries and blackcurrants with sandalwood, mint and other classic herbs. Full-bodied and dense with ultra-fine tannins. Silky in all ways. Goes on for a long, long time. A blend of 79% cabernet sauvignon, 11% cabernet franc and 10% merlot. Joyous and serious wine for the vintage. And comparable to 2014 and 2015. Try after 2023. The grand vin 2017 Chateau Leoville Las Cases checks in as 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc, and 10% Merlot, harvested between the 15th of September and the 4th of October. Brought up in 90% new French oak, it has an incredibly classic style that carries loads of creme de cassis, crushed rock, graphite, and smoked tobacco-like aromatics. These carry to a full-bodied, concentrated, elegant Las Cases that has fine tannins, flawless balance, and a great finish. It shows the refined, regal style of this estate, has beautiful richness and depth, and is going to drink nicely with just 5-7 years of bottle age. Rich ruby in colour if a little less inky than the 2015, 2016 or 2018. Clear layers of fruit, the nose is one of the rare ones in the vintage where you want to spend time just thinking about the different strands that are coming at you. Black truffle, liquorice, cinnamon spice, saffron, slate and cigar box all comprise - this is a standout wine in the vintage. They just know how to tease flavour out of the ground at this place. Yes it is closed, not exactly forbidding but certainly austere, with big tannins, but less so than in some vintages at this stage, and it unrolls in the mouth. A very focused, very pure rendition, laden with cassis, plum reduction and boysenberry puree fruit that is mostly waiting in reserve. A cold cast iron edge imparts a sense of restraint, while smoldering tobacco, charcoal and alder notes are deeply buried on the finish. The opposite of flamboyant. In need of time. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Best from 2025 through 2040. The watchword for this wine is style. Tannins underline the fruit. This rich structure, while not losing the swaths of berry flavors and crisp black currants, presents the balance between the ripeness and freshness of the vintage. Drink this wine from 2024. One of the finest wines of the vintage in Bordeaux, the 2017 Léoville Las Cases is a beautiful Saint-Julien that bursts from the glass with expressive aromas of cassis, wild berries, pencil shavings, violets and a subtle hint of cigar box. Medium to full-bodied, supple and enveloping, its unusually charming, sensual profile largely conceals a considerable endowment of tannin and a bright spine of acidity. Largely spared by the frost due to its optimal location on the bank of the Gironde, and subject to a draconian selection, the 2017's giving style reflects not only the vintage but also more restrained use of press wine chez Las Cases, seeing only 7% in the blend as opposed to the 10% to 12% that was typical not too long ago. It's a masterpiece. Best After 2023 "

Deep ruby/purple-hued, with a smorgasbord-like array of red, blue, and black fruits as well as violets, candied flowers, tobacco, and sappy herbs, it hits the palate with medium to full-bodied richness, a deep, layered, concentrated mouthfeel, flawless balance, and that rare mix of power and elegance that truly great Pessac can deliver. Showing the more elegant style of the vintage, it checks in behind the magical, perfect 2018 but is very much in the style of the 2016. Readers will love having this beauty in the cellar, and it will evolve for 40-50 years if stored correctly. Hats off to winemaker Guillaume Pouthier for another thrilling wine. Best After 2022 What a great nose with such complexity of blackberry, forest floor, mushroom and bark. Like walking in a deep forest. Full-bodied with a dense palate, yet it remains energetic and focused. Very fine texture. Flavorful finish. Extremely persistent. Fantastic young 2019. Best after 2028. The 2019 Les Carmes Haut-Brion has turned out very well in bottle. Mingling aromas of plums and cassis with notions of blood orange, warm spices and new oak, it's full-bodied, velvety and seamless, with an ample core of bright, succulent fruit that's framed by an elegantly muscular chassis of ripe, powdery tannins and lively acids. Concluding with a long, expansive finish, it's reminiscent of a more giving, extroverted version of Pouthier's superb 2016. As is now the rule at this address, some whole bunches were retained during maceration, and the wine saw a long élevage in a variety of vessels, from classic 225-liter Bordeaux barriques to foudres and amphorae. The blend is dominated by 42% Cabernet Franc, complemented by 31% Cabernet Sauvignon and the balance Merlot. Best After 2026 "

The palate is textbook Oloroso, round, ample, warm, a little spirity, ending with dry walnut flavors. It manages to balance power and elegance quite well. Displays a flicker of sweetness running through the golden raisin and date notes, adding a flattering hint to offset the dry Brazil nut, clove, powdered ginger and salted caramel details. Stays elegant through the finish. Dominated by notes of salted almonds, this Oloroso has its fair share of sweetness to balance that saline side, making it more readily accessible to a wider range of palates and fitting perfectly with smoked pork. True as dry oloroso comes, with nutty aromas combined with caramel richness. Feels raring to go, with pumped-up acidity that boosts otherwise normal flavors of dried white fruits, mixed nuts and brine. Tight, long and driving on the finish. "

It spent one year in the foudre and a further year in barrels. The wine shows a little riper than the 2020 I tasted next to it, which is a little unusual, because the year was cooler. It has 14% alcohol, as they harvested looking for acidity and pH rather than alcohol. The palate is much better: the wine is serious and balanced, with very fine tannins and a strong chalky sensation. It should integrate the oak with some more time in bottle, and the wine has the stuffing to do so. 4,000 bottles, 30 magnums and five double magnums produced. It was bottled in September 2021.

Medium to full-bodied, layered and nicely concentrated, it's quite vinous and textural, with racy acids and a pretty pinpoint mousse, concluding with a saline finish. It's as fine a rendition of this cuvée as I can remember tasting. This is chardonnnay from the chalk soils of Avize, Oger and Cramant. Its flavors provide a contrast of limestone severity and the richness of freshly churned butter, buzzing with apple-blossom scents. The wine’s staunch structure will take on lobster dipped in butter, even as the flavors encourage it. "

This hot-climate expression shows a dark and savory side of Sangiovese. Michele and Giacomo Satta have been producing this flagship Sangiovese from Bolgheri since the appellation's inception. Despite officially not being included in the DOC because of the use of 100% Sangiovese, this is still an iconic wine of Tuscany. From this year, researching the fragrance of fruit, they have started to vinify one-third of the harvest with whole clusters. The wine is pale ruby in colour, expressive of delicious and precise raspberry fruit with roasted nut toastiness. It shows great balance between its tight-knit structure of ripe tannins and crisp acidity. Drinking Window 2019 - 2029 "

The wine imparts dark fruit aromas with plum, pressed blackberry, tar, smoke and tobacco. Despite the immediate power of the wine, it ultimately performs with elegance and softness.

This wine sees a prolonged fermentation period (of up to one month) and undergoes malolactic fermentation in cement before aging in large oak casks for two years (and one year in bottle before its commercial release).

3608,Domaine Thibault Liger-Belair Clos Vougeot,2018,Pinot Noir,France,339,0,0.0,0,"The 2018 Clos de Vougeot shows a bit of the heat and the concentration of the year: the harvest was nearly 20% down on 2017. Liger-Belair used the same techniques in the winery: 30% whole clusters, a three-week cuvaison, and aging over two winters in cask, half new. The result, however, is even darker and concentrated than the previous year – one might say almost slightly porty.

Scorched earth, tar, licorice and espresso are some of the notes that emerge from this huge, massive wine. The 2009 possesses stunning depth and more than enough fruit to balance its muscular tannin. It seems to bring together the best elements of both the 2007 and 2008. This is a dazzling showing. The 2009 is 93% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Petit Verdot.  An elegant style, with a graceful mix of dark berry, dried currant, spice and dusty earth, turning dry and finishing with fine-grained tannins that give the flavors traction.

The 2018 Barolo Via Nuova is fermented in steel and aged in oak according to time-tested local tradition. This mid-weight blended Barolo has a more prominent herbal or balsam signature at the back of red and purple fruits, licorice and pressed violet. Fascinating aromatic complexity that keeps your nose hovering over the glass. Raspberries with ginger biscuits, flowers and a twist of basil. There’s a deeper layer of crushed goji berries and talc-like minerals, too. Full, intense, silky and dainty with well-integrated tannins that even add a chocolatey touch. From organically grown grapes. So tempting to drink now, but better from 2024. A fragrant and elegant red, delivering tuberose, strawberry, cherry and grassy aromas and flavors.

Still vivid purple-hued and loaded with notions of crème de cassis, leafy herbs, dried tobacco, graphite, and a touch of loamy soil notes, it hits the palate with full-bodied richness, a seamless mouthfeel, and building yet perfectly ripe tannins. It’s as concentrated as the 2015 yet offers a more polished, seamless style that’s already hard to resist. I doubt it will ever shut down, and it’s a wine that will offer pleasure today as well as in 30 years or more Blackberry and blueberry aromas with orange peel.

It has building tannins, but the balance is as good as it gets, and it has a finish that won’t quit. Fermented with 35% whole clusters and aged 32 months in 60% new French oak, it’s going to keep for a solid 15 years or more. This cuvée comes entirely from the Krankl’s “home” vineyard—the Cumulus vineyard in Oak View, just south and inland from Santa Barbara, on the road to Ojai. There are now just over 12.5 acres planted at Cumulus. The first plantings of Syrah, Grenache and Roussanne took place in 2004. A little more Grenache was planted in 2005.

3640,Domaine Julien Nuits-Saint-Georges,2018,Pinot Noir,France,69,0,0.0,0,"From four lieux-dits in the south of the appellation comes the 2018 Nuits-Saint-Georges Village, a pretty wine offering up scents of cherries, cassis and strawberries mingled with loamy soil and toasty new oak. On the palate, it's medium to full-bodied, fleshy and charming, with polished tannins and a gently oak-inflected finish. "
3641,Prunotto Bric Turot Barbaresco,2015,Nebbiolo,Italy,81,13.5,0.0,0,"Cherry, hay, rose and tobacco aromas and flavors are the highlights of this fluid Barbaresco. Firmly structured and balanced by the sweet, ripe fruit at the core. Shows fine length and leaves a mouthwatering impression. Best from 2022 through 2033. Dried roses, fresh cranberries, citrus and spices. Medium to full body, a driven line of acidity, firm tannins and a fresh finish. Scorched earth, leather, underbrush and a balsamic note of camphor slowly take shape on this. The palate is lean-bodied and focused, offering sour cherry, cranberry and a hint of baking spice alongside fine-grained tannins and surprisingly bright acidity given the hot vintage. Give it time to fully come around. Drink 2023–2030. The 2015 Barbaresco Bric Turot has a toasty front nose and not much grit in the mouth, but it's more polished and relaxed overall. These are qualities I generally associate with the 2015 vintage. There is good structure and firmness at the back. "
3642,Laherte Freres Extra Brut Rose de Saignee Les Beaudiers,2016,Sparkling Rosé,France,99,0,0.0,0,"Derived from the 2016 vintage, the newly disgorged NV Extra-Brut Rosé de Saignée Les Beaudiers unfurls in the glass with aromas of orange rind, rose petals, red berries and dried flowers. Medium to full-bodied, ample and fleshy, it's lively and perfumed, with a pinpoint mousse and a long, saline finish. "
3643,Domaine Dujac Morey-St-Denis Blanc,2020,Chardonnay,France,129,0,0.0,0,"Shows a lovely ripe apricot and lemon peel fruit, with a hint of spice, in a waxy, dense texture that is broad on the palate but not heavy. Dujac has planted Chardonnay in a 0.65ha parcel of village-level vines. The grapes are lightly pressed and fermented in tank prior to ageing for a year in cask (20% new). "

Again the very light mentholated touch. The fruit is on the cherry/raspberry cusp with good acidity, medium density, fine persistence. A light orange blossom touch as well to complete an interesting, complex wine "

Spicy, chalky and aromatic, with 25% new wood, commendable finesse and palate length and ripe, textured red fruit flavours. "
3650,Chateau des Jacques Moulin-a-Vent,2018,Gamay,France,28,0,3.6,10,"Aromas of blackberries, violets, candied peel and spices introduce the 2018 Moulin-à-Vent, a medium to full-bodied, fleshy wine with succulent acids, a generous core of fruit and fine, powdery tannins. This is a pure and generous, comparatively fruit-driven wine from the Château des Jacques. A blend from eight single vineyard sites. Some oak is evident on both nose and palate but adds extra depth and structure to this classy Moulin-à-Vent. There is good purity of fruit here with an appealing mix of forward fruit ripeness and cleansing acidity to finish. Good example of this Cru which is appealing now but has the stuffing to age for three-plus years. Pureed black cherry and raspberry notes are backed by plush tannins and vivid acidity. Rich accents of anise and dried violet give depth through the finish. Drink now through 2026. "
3651,Domaine des Comtes Lafon Beaune Les Epenottes Premier Cru,2019,Pinot Noir,France,99,0,0.0,0,"An attractively floral and perfumed nose is comprised primarily by ripe red berry aromas and discreet spice wisps. The delicious, round and fleshy middle medium-bodied flavors are shaped by relatively fine-grained tannins on the balanced and lingering finish. While the tannins may be fine-grained, they're sufficiently dense that this too should reward 10+ years of cellaring. "
3652,Daniel & Julien Barraud Pouilly-Fuisse Clos de la Verchere Premier Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,54,0,0.0,0,"A vague whiff of the exotic is a background element on the yellow fruit, citrus and muscat-scented nose. There is excellent richness to the dense and opulent flavors that brim with sappy dry extract that imparts a textured mouthfeel to the clean, bright and moderately dry finale. This has a lovely, spicy, ripe apple fruit and a delightfully creamy texture with no hint of heaviness. The domaine has always produced single-vineyard wines and this is one of the most long-standing. It is made from south-facing vines in a clos downslope from Les Crays. The fruit is lightly crushed prior to pressing and fermented on native yeasts in cask (15% new). "
3653,Albert Bichot Nuits-Saint-Georges Blanc Les Terrasses du Chateau Gris,2018,Chardonnay,France,129,13,0.0,0,"White wines are rare in the Côte de Nuits, especially of this quality. Grown above the town on terraces, as its name makes clear, this comes from very poor soils and is suitably chiselled, focused and well-balanced. With well-integrated 20% new wood, crunchy citrus and limestone flavours and a long, tangy finish, this is a delightful Chardonnay. Floral, nutty and creamy elements combine intrigtuingly on the nose of this wine and continue on the bright, poised palate. Stoniness, texture, yeast and concentration make for an intense mouthfeel surrounded by freshness. It's an elegant wine with inherent balance. "
3654,Patrick Piuze Chablis Vaillons Les Minots Premier Cru,2020,Chardonnay,France,79,0,0.0,0,"Offers an underlying lemon theme, which is enhanced by a kiss of vanilla. Subtle yet intense and long, building nicely to a crescendo of citrus, apple, mineral and oak spice. Drink now. "

Next, the palate comes in with gentle smoke, the gamyness blending with ripe red-cherry fruit. The slender body shows a fine web of tannin as well as lovely freshness. "
3657,Honig Cabernet Sauvignon (1.5 Liter Magnum),2018,Cabernet Sauvignon,California,115,14.8,0.0,0,"COMMENTARY: The 2018 Honig Cabernet Sauvignon nicely defines this grape variety in the Napa Valley. TASTING NOTES: This wine offers attractive aromas and flavors of black fruit, oak, and licorice. Pair it with slices of grilled ribeye in a toss with garden-fresh greens. (Tasted: April 27, 2021, San Francisco, CA) "

3659,Cave des Vignerons de Mancey Cremant de Bourgogne Brut,Reserve,Non-Vintage Sparkling Wine,France,22,12.5,3.8,5,"Ripe red and yellow apple create a fruity nose on this wine. The palate has ripe apple mellowness and creamy roundness, as well as a crisp nature. Bubbles are lively and this dry wine presents a harmonious whole. "
3660,Domaine Santa Duc Le Pied de Baud Chateauneuf-du-Pape,2019,Rhone Red Blends,France,109,0,0.0,0,"The 2019 Châteauneuf Du Pape Le Pied De Baud offers a deeper purple/ruby hue as well as a ripe, more up-front bouquet of red and blue fruits, ground pepper, violets, and more minerality, which comes through more on the palate. Rich, medium to full-bodied, and structured, give bottles a few years and enjoy over the following decade or more. This cuvée comes from the pebbly soils of the Pied de Baud lieu-dit, was partially destemmed, and is 80% Grenache and 10% each of Cinsault and Mourvèdre. Nicely expressive, with an open and inviting array of warmed raspberry and plum reduction notes, while red tea, anise and fruitcake hints fill in the background. Stays silky in feel, with just a twinge of bramble for a nice textural contrast, ending with an encore of friendly fruit. Grenache, Mourvèdre and Cinsault. Drink now. "
3661,Loimer Langenlois Kamptal Riesling,2018,Riesling,Austria,25,12,0.0,0,"A pretty, elegant version, with cardamom and elderflower accents lacing the stone fruit notes. Minerally undertones give this brightness and freshness. "
3662,Billaud-Simon Chablis Tete d'Or,2019,Chardonnay,France,61,13,0.0,0,"A dollop of wood sets off a ripe mix of both white and yellow orchard fruit laced with nuances of iodine and seashore. There is fine mid-palate density to the intense and saline-suffused flavors that terminate in an agreeably clean and dry finish. This could use better depth but since it always seems to age extremely well, more should develop if giving a chance. Worth checking out. "
3663,Alvear Fino En Rama,2016,Other Fortified,Spain,25,0,0.0,0,"Lots of flor character here with bread-dough, salt and floral aromas and dried-lemon and apple undertones. It’s medium-bodied with lovely fruit and a dry finish. Very real. Drink now. "

The rich, vibrant and robust middle weight plus flavors possess both good richness and definition while displaying a subtle bead of minerality on the more structured and youthfully austere finale. This bold effort will require at least some patience. This is good stuff and very Grèves. "
3666,Qupe Grenache,2017,Grenache,California,29,13.8,3.5,8,"Very light in the glass, this bottling begins with bright aromas of red cherry, sumac, pomegranate and French toast spices.

3671,Henschke Cyril Cabernet Sauvignon,2015,Cabernet Sauvignon,Australia,180,14.5,0.0,0,"After a year’s hiatus, Cyril is back, and almost entirely composed of 99% Cabernet this vintage (with 1% Cab Franc). It’s all the more expressive for it. Blueberry and black cherry fruit is neatly tucked behind notes of iodine, cigar box, tomato leaf, dried herbs and flowers. The palate is slinky and sexy, but also powerful. It offers crunchy fruit, taut tannins and layers of tex- ture. Uniquely Henschke, there isn’t another wine in Australia like it. Drink now–2040. Svelte and refined, the 2015 Cyril Henschke Cabernet Sauvignon is wonderfully composed and complete. Hints of cedar, earth and tobacco appear on the nose alongside cassis and black cherries, while the medium to full-bodied palate is streamlined yet generous and richly textured, leading into a lingering, silky finish. Elegant and concentrated, it should drink well for over a decade. From a great cabernet vintage in Eden Valley, this has a wealth of fresh-herb, forest-leaf and wood aromas with an assertive and richly fruited palate that has a strong core of ripe blackeberries and blackcurrants with subtly toasty oak and ripe, plush, velvety tannins. A blend of 99% cabernet sauvignon and 1% cabernet franc. Drink over the next 15 years. "
3672,Morey-Coffinet Puligny-Montrachet Le Trezin,2020,Chardonnay,France,119,0,0.0,0,"A phenolic whiff is subtle though perceptible on the even more floral-suffused nose of wet stone, green apple and white peach. Here too there is excellent verve to the more mineral-driven though less generously proportioned medium-bodied flavors that possess fine cut on the youthfully austere and sneaky long finish. This is also a distinguished Puligny villages that is equally worth consideration. "
3673,Domaine Joseph Voillot Pommard Vieilles Vignes,2018,Pinot Noir,France,79,13,0.0,0,"Fresh and focused, with a line of sinewy tannins underneath cherry, boysenberry and earth flavors. Firm, yet also on the elegant side, this red shows plenty of character. Best from. As usual, the 2018 Pommard Vieilles Vignes is a touch more muscular than the corresponding Volnay, but it's no less refined this year, delivering aromas of plums, cherries and spices, followed by a medium to full-bodied, velvety, nicely concentrated palate. "
3674,Arnaud Mortet Gevrey-Chambertin Lavaux St-Jacques Premier Cru,2018,Pinot Noir,France,299,0,0.0,0,"Arnaud Mortet makes two impressive renditions of this excellent Premiers Crus and I just prefer this négociant bottling in 2018, made with 50% whole bunches where the central stem is painstakingly removed by hand. The stems give the wine a little extra lift and complexity, adding notes of clove and pepper spice to the fresh, floral, red-fruited palate. Textured, hedonistic stuff with refreshing underlying acidity. "
3675,Bodega Quinta Sardonia Sardon Red,2019,Tempranillo,Spain,19,15,0.0,0,"A beautiful red with plum, berry and cherry aromas and flavors. Hints of spices, such as cloves. Medium body. Fresh and lightly chewy with a linear mouth feel. A balanced, medium-bodied red, offering a creamy, well-meshed range of crushed blackberry, stone, dried thyme and ground coffee aromas and flavors, with light, fine tannins. Tempranillo, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now. "
3676,Pikes Eastside Shiraz,2015,Syrah/Shiraz,Australia,29,14,0.0,0,"Primary and bold, with wonderfully pure and succulent red fruits. The palate is sinewy, but with fine tannins and fresh acidity. It evolves beautifully in the glass, an exciting, textured wine that finishes on a savoury note. Bright and breezy. "

3678,Domaine Robert-Denogent Macon-Fuisse Les Taches,2017,Chardonnay,France,43,0,0.0,0,"Raised in concrete eggs and barrels for fully 24 months, the 2017 Mâcon-Fuissé Les Tâches opens in the glass with aromas of warm bread, dried white flowers and crisp yellow and green orchard fruit. Medium to full-bodied, satiny and incisive, it's deep and tensile, with a racy spine of acidity and fine depth at the core. Still tightly wound, it will reward some bottle age. "
3679,Alphonse Mellot La Moussiere Sancerre Blanc (1.5 Liter Magnum),2021,Sauvignon Blanc,France,89,0,0.0,0,"An impressive 2021 with quite ripe, rich, mouth-filling fruit with notes of grapefruit. Currently it is a little tight in the well-balanced finish, but I expect the young 2021 will develop further in bottle. The long established Alphonse Mellot domaine, with 52ha in the Sancerre appellation, has its cellars right in the centre of the town of Sancerre. La Moussière is a more than 30ha south-facing parcel planted on Kimmeridgian marne on the left hand side of the main road to Bourges. Around 50% of La Moussière is barrel fermented. "

3681,Matanzas Creek Sonoma County Sauvignon Blanc (375ML half-bottle),2021,Sauvignon Blanc,California,11,13.6,0.0,0,"Matanzas Creek has a lengthy history of producing very good, incisively varietal Sauvignon Blancs, and this, its basic Sonoma County bottling, is no exception. The wine leads with a lightly herbal, mildly grassy nose that sports a nice sense of sweet citrus fruit, and it picks up on both those themes in its spry and very long-lasting flavors. It is a continuous and very cohesive wine that, while winning easy recommendation for its balance and varietal precision, gets an especially appreciative nod of approval for achieving what it does at most inviting price. "
3682,Thierry Violot-Guillemard Beaune Clos des Mouches Premier Cru,2016,Pinot Noir,France,89,13,0.0,0,"The 2016 Beaune 1er Cru Clos des Mouches offers up an attractive bouquet of plums, wild berries and licorice, followed by a medium to full-bodied, velvety palate that's texturally elegant and attractively vibrant, concluding with good length on the finish. Violot-Guillemard produced a normal harvest of Clos des Mouches in 2016, and the wine is very attractive, offering up aromas of creamy red and black fruit and licorice, with a supple, open-knit but nicely concentrated palate impression structured around fine, velvety tannins and revealing a juicy core of fruit. Medium density youthful colour. There is a little reduction on the nose, but not aggressive. Add marks if and when this blows off, because for the moment it also slightly hardens the finish. No question about the intensity though, nor the length 88. The reduction does blow off quite quickly, and the finish is very stylish now. "
3683,Chateau de Saint Cosme Cotes du Rhone Blanc le Poste,2020,Rhone White Blends,France,79,13,0.0,0,"On another level, the 2020 Côtes Du Rhône Le Poste Blanc comes from a gorgeous vineyard in Gigondas (Gigondas doesn’t allow whites, hence the Côtes Du Rhône label) just up the hill from the estate. It has lots of pineapple, bright, sappy herb, and some chalky mineral-notes as well as a medium-bodied, pure, seamless style on the palate. It’s a brilliant white and shows how shortsighted it is for this appellation to not allow whites. I like this today, yet it will be better with a year of bottle age and have a decade of longevity. "
3684,Domaine Pierre Labet Beaune Clos du Dessus des Marconnets Blanc,2015,Chardonnay,France,99,0,0.0,0,"Subtle, with honeyed apple, grapefruit and spice flavors on an elegant frame. Persists through the lingering aftertaste of tangy fruit and mineral. Drink now through 2022. "
3685,Tridente Tempranillo,2017,Tempranillo,Spain,16,0,0.0,0,"Bright purple. Intense cherry, blueberry and floral pastille scents on the spice-accented nose and in the mouth. Round and fleshy in style, with a spine of juicy acidity providing lift and structure to sweet black and blue fruit and mocha flavors. Closes with gentle grip and very good persistence, the velvety tannins framing the wine's sweet fruit. "
3686,Aston Estate Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir,2015,Pinot Noir,California,79,14.5,0.0,0,"Zeroes in on a supple core of juicy, zesty blackberry and wild berry flavors, maintaining a tight focus, ending with fine-grained tannins and a persistent fruity aftertaste. "
3687,Bodegas Lavia Monastrell-Syrah,2017,Rhone Red Blends,Spain,18,14.5,3.4,5,"The eponymous 2017 Lavia has more Monastrell than in previous vintages, and there's only 20% Syrah in the bottled blend. 2017 was an early and low-yielding year. The grapes fermented in stainless steel with indigenous yeasts, and the wine matured in 10,000-liter oak vats and used 500-liter oak barrels for one year. It's drinkable and Mediterranean, juicy and with fine tannin, serious enough within the more approachable and drinkable profile of the wine. Even in a warm vintage, the altitude of the zone gives the wine a touch of freshness, a characteristic of Bullas. 40,500 bottles produced. It was bottled in August 2019. "
3688,Gianni Brunelli Rosso di Montalcino,2019,Sangiovese,Italy,44,0,0.0,0,"A blend of Sangiovese grapes from Podernovone - which lies at 500 metres above sea level on the southeast hillside of Montalcino with a southwest exposure - and Canalicchio on the northern side of the village. The vines were planted in 1998 for the former vineyard, and in 1989 for the latter. 'Our Rosso is produced by the same grapeas as Brunello,' said Laura Brunelli. This new 2019 bottling is more concentrated than the lighter 2018, and more balanced than the warm 2017. This wine, traditionally aged in large oak vessels for one year, is extremely fresh and not without complexity. Red currants, wild strawberry, black pepper and juniper aromas are followed by a brightness of savoury red fruits on the medium-bodied palate. It has velvety tannins and refreshing, integrated acidity. A really great interpretation of the terroir. "
3689,Cadence Cara Maria Vineyard Bel Canto,2018,Bordeaux Red Blends,Washington,64,14.4,0.0,0,"For decades, winemaker Ben Smith has had a love affair with Cabernet Franc from Red Mountain. This wine, where the variety comprises 73% with the rest Merlot, shows why. The aromas are a complete delight, with notes of raspberry, moist earth, flowers and berries. The flavors are layered and pure, showing great texture. It's showy, but with no shortage of structure. "
3690,Rutini Encuentro Malbec,2019,Malbec,Argentina,19,0,0.0,0,"Spicy, brambly fruit with some roasted sesame and coffee. There is a nice, savory edge of dried herbs, too. A soft, medium-bodied red with a bright, juicy fruit core. Elegant and drinkable style, showing coffee and dried herbs at the end. Drink now. "
3691,Weingut Spreitzer Oestricher Lenchen Riesling Kabinett,2018,Riesling,Germany,23,0,0.0,0,"An open-textured version, with a richly spiced midpalate and notes of ripe citrus and yellow apple. Generous up front, but tails off slightly on the finish. Remains charming nonetheless. "
